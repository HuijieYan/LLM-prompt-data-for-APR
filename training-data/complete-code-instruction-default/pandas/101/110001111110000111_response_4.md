The issue is related to the incorrect handling of NaN values when casting a categorical series back to an integer dtype. The failing test is attempting to convert a categorical series containing NaN to an integer dtype, but it results in an unexpected negative integer value. The GitHub issue also mentions the same problem, where NaN in category converts to an incorrect integer negative value instead of NaN in IntX(nullable integer) or float.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block that handles the conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype. The function should properly handle NaN values during this conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code responsible for handling the conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype. The correct implementation should return NaN for any NaN values present in the categorical series when casting to an integer dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    elif is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        # Handle conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype
        if is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            return arr.astype(dtype).where(arr.notna(), np.nan)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return arr.view(dtype)
``` 

This corrected code properly handles the conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype by returning NaN for any NaN values present in the categorical series. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
