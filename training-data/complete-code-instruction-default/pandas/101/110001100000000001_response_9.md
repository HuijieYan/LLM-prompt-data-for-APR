Potential error: 
The potential error in the buggy function is that there are multiple conditional statements that could lead to a scenario where none of the conditions are met, causing the function to reach the end without returning a value.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the function always returns a value. We could add a default return statement at the end of the function to handle any cases where none of the conditions are met.

Updated and corrected code:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Rest of the code, including all the conditional statements, remains as is

    # Add a default return statement at the end to handle any cases where none of the conditions are met
    return arr.view(dtype)
```
