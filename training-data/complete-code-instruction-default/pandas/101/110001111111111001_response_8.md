The bug is likely caused by the conversion of NaT values to integer types (int64) when calling the `astype_nansafe` function. The failing tests are expecting a ValueError to be raised when attempting to perform this conversion, but the function currently does not handle NaT values properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `astype_nansafe` function to handle NaT values and raise a ValueError when attempting to convert them to integer types.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # existing code

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # existing code
```

With these changes, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle NaT values properly and raise a ValueError when attempting to convert them to integer types. This should make the function pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
