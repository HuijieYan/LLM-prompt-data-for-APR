The problematic function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` attempts to convert an array with a `NaT` value to an integer type, but it does not raise the expected `ValueError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function can be identified as the section responsible for processing datetime and timedelta conversions, as well as the section for handling finite values.

The root cause of the bug is that when converting `NaT` values to an integer type, the function does not raise the expected `ValueError`. This issue has been reported in the GitHub issue as "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs".

To fix the bug, we need to update the function such that it properly handles the conversion of `NaT` values to an integer type and correctly raises a `ValueError` when necessary. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue raised in the GitHub report.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    TypeError
        If unable to perform the astype operation.

    """

    # (Rest of the function remains the same)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and dtype == np.int64:
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # (Rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert `NaT` values to an integer type, as expected. This fix will address the failing test case and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report.
