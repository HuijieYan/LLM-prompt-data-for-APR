The issue is caused by the inconsistent handling of NaN values when converting from categorical data to integer data types. The failing test indicates that the function `astype_nansafe` does not handle NaN values properly when converting datetime or timedelta arrays to integer data types. This results in unexpected behavior and error messages.

The bug is caused by the lack of proper handling for NaN values in the conversion process. The failing test is designed to check whether the function correctly raises a ValueError when attempting to convert NaN values to integers, but the function does not behave as expected.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be updated to handle NaN values appropriately when converting from datetime/timedelta arrays to integer data types. This will involve adding conditional checks and appropriate error handling for cases involving NaN values.

To resolve the issue and pass the failing test, additional checks and conditional logic should be added to ensure that NaN values are handled correctly when performing the datatype conversion. This will involve updating the code within the `astype_nansafe` function to address the specific cases identified in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... existing code ...

    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):
        if "int" in str(dtype):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NA/T values to integer")

    # ... remaining code ...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

By making the updates above, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle NaN values properly when performing the datatype conversion. This should resolve the issue and enable the function to pass the failing test cases.
