Based on the failing test, the error message, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the conversion of NaN values in a categorical series to integer values. This causes unexpected behavior, as NaN should be preserved, but it is instead converted to an incorrect integer value.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section that handles the conversion of object types to integer types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the conversion of NaN values in a categorical series to integer or floating-point values in a more appropriate manner.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to implement a conditional check for NaN values in the categorical series before performing the conversion to integers. For NaN values, the function should preserve them as NaN in the resulting integer or floating-point array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.api.types as ptypes

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if ptypes.is_categorical_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if np.nan in arr:
            return arr.astype('Int64')
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    else:
        # the rest of the function remains unchanged
        pass
```

This corrected code includes a conditional check for categorical dtype and integer conversion, ensuring that if NaN is present in the array, it will be correctly cast to 'Int64' to preserve the NaN values. All other functionality in the function remains unchanged.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
