The bug appears to be caused by the improper handling of NaN values when converting categorical data to integer type. The failing test is trying to convert a `np.datetime64("NaT")` or `np.timedelta64("NaT")` to `np.int64`, and the buggy function is not handling this case properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the conversion of NaN values to int and ensure that the expected ValueError is raised when attempting to convert NaN values to int.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and (np.isnat(arr).any() or np.isnan(arr).any()):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this implementation, when the function attempts to cast NaN values to an integer type, it will raise a ValueError as expected, and the failing test is expected to pass. Additionally, the issue reported on GitHub about converting categorical data to int and the unexpected transformation of NaN to incorrect integer values should be resolved with this fix.
