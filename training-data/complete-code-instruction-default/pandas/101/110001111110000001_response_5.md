The bug is likely caused by the check for NaN values when casting a datetime or timedelta array to an integer. The buggy function is not correctly handling the case where the value is "NaT" (not a time) and trying to convert it to an integer.

To fix the bug, we can add a specific check for the "NaT" value and raise a ValueError when it is encountered, instead of allowing the conversion to continue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype with "NaT" values.
    """

    # (previous code remains unchanged)

    if np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With this fix, the failing test should pass as the specific case of "NaT" values being converted to an integer is handled correctly.
