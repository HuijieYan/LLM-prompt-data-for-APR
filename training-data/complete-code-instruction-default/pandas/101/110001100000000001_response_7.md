The potential error in the code is the use of 'dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)' which is raising an AttributeError as 'dtype' does not have the attribute 'construct_array_type'.

The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the 'dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)' line, which is trying to call a method that does not exist. This is causing an AttributeError and preventing the function from executing properly.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to remove the incorrect use of 'dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)', and possibly replace it with a correct method call or a different approach to achieve the intended functionality.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)  # corrected line

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the line 'dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)' has been replaced with 'dtype._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)', which should resolve the AttributeError and improve the functionality of the function.
