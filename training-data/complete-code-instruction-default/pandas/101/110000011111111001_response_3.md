Based on the failing test and the provided function, it seems the issue arises when trying to convert NaT values to integer using `astype_nansafe`. The target dtype is set to `np.int64` and the parameters for the test seem to be NaN or NaT values. The issue seems to stem from the conversion of NaT values to integer. 

To fix this, we need to check for NaT values when the target dtype is `np.int64` and handle them appropriately. We can also use the provided input and output variable information to ensure that the fixed function satisfies the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if arr.dtype == np.datetime64 or arr.dtype == np.timedelta64:
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    else:
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this modification, we have added a check for NaN when the target dtype is `np.int64` to ensure we don't convert NaN values to integer, and instead raise a ValueError. This should fix the issue reported in the failing test.
