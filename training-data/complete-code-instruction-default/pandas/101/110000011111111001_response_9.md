The buggy function is `astype_nansafe`. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` tries to run the `astype_nansafe` function with the NaT value and expects a ValueError to be raised. However, the function does not raise a ValueError as expected, which causes the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function is in the block handling NaT values for datetime64 and timedelta64 types. When a value is NaT, the function should have raised a ValueError, but it fails to do so.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle NaT values for datetime64 and timedelta64 types correctly. Instead of correctly handling the NaT value, it tries to convert it to int64, leading to the failure of the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle NaT values for datetime64 and timedelta64 types. When the input array contains NaT values, the function should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if arr.dtype == np.datetime64 and arr[0] == np.datetime64('NaT'):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    elif arr.dtype == np.timedelta64 and arr[0] == np.timedelta64('NaT'):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    else:
        # rest of the function remains the same
        pass
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass as it will now correctly handle NaT values and raise a ValueError when necessary.
