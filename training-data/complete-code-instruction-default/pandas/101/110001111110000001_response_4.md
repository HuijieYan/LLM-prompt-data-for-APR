The problem with the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the input array `arr` contains "NaT" values (Not a Time) and it needs to be converted to an integer type. The function should raise a `ValueError` in this case, but it fails to do so.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the case when `arr` contains "NaT" values and needs to be converted to an integer type.

The cause of the bug is that the function `astype_nansafe` does not handle the "NaT" values properly and does not raise a `ValueError` as expected when trying to convert the "NaT" values to an integer type.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check to handle the "NaT" values when converting to an integer type and raise a `ValueError` in that case.

Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and pd.isnull(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, we specifically check if the input array `arr` contains "NaT" values and the desired output type is an integer type. If this condition is satisfied, we raise the `ValueError` as expected.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now pass the failing test that checks for the correct handling of "NaT" values when converting to an integer type.
