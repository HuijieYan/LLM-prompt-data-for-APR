The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the input tensors are being processed and mapped to the corresponding layers. It seems that there is an issue with the creation and mapping of the input tensors, as well as the handling of the layer mappings.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of input tensors and their corresponding layers, leading to incorrect mappings and ultimately resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input tensors are correctly created and mapped to their corresponding layers. Additionally, the layer mappings need to be handled properly to ensure that the correct layers are being used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
            input_tensor = input_tensors[i]
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we have simplified the handling of input tensors and their corresponding layers. We directly map the input tensors to their respective layers and ensure that the mappings are correctly stored in the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` dictionaries. This should address the issues with incorrect mappings and ultimately produce the expected output.
