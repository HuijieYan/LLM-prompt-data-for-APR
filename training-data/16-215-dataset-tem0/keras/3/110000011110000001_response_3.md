1. The buggy function is supposed to clone a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The failing test is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, but it fails with an assertion error indicating that it could not compute the output for a specific tensor.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it iterates over every node in the reference model, in depth order, and tries to call the new layer based on the input tensors.

3. The bug is caused by the failure to properly compute the output tensors for the cloned model. This is evident from the failing test and error message, which indicate that the output tensor for the `SwapLayer` is not being computed correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the input and output tensors are properly mapped and computed during the cloning process.
   - Checking for any issues related to the creation of new layers and their configurations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create a new model
    new_model = keras.models.clone_model(model)

    return new_model
```

In this corrected code, the `_clone_functional_model` function simply uses the `clone_model` method from `keras.models` to clone the model. This should address the issues with computing the output tensors and ensure that the cloned model behaves as expected.
