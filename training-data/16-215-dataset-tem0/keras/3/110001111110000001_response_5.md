The buggy function is `_clone_functional_model` which is supposed to clone a functional `Model` instance. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, but it fails with an assertion error because it cannot compute the output tensor.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it iterates over every node in the reference model, in depth order, and tries to call the new layer based on the input tensors.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the model has multiple outputs, which leads to the failure in computing the output tensor.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle models with multiple outputs. This can be achieved by ensuring that the output tensors are properly computed and added to the `tensor_map`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            continue

        reference_input_tensors = layer.input
        reference_output_tensors = layer.output

        computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected code, the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` should pass without any assertion errors.
