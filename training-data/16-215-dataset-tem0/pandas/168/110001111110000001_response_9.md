The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function takes several parameters such as `obj`, `key`, `axis`, `level`, `sort`, `observed`, `mutated`, and `validate`.

The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to group the DataFrame `df` by the `group_name` along the axis 1 and then sum the values. The test is failing with a `KeyError` when the `group_name` is a list `["x"]`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is not handling the case where `key` is a list properly, which is causing the `KeyError` when `group_name` is a list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `key` parameter to properly handle the case where it is a list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By modifying the handling of the `key` parameter to properly handle the case where it is a list, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
