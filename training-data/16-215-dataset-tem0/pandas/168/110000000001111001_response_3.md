The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. The function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the case when `key` is a list. We can do this by iterating over each element in the `key` list and processing them individually.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # ... (existing code for handling level)

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # ... (existing code for handling Grouper)

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        groupers = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, obj = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            groupers.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        return groupers, exclusions, obj

    else:
        # ... (existing code for handling other cases)

    # ... (remaining code)

```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case when `key` is a list, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied.
