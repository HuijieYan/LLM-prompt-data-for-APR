The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of grouping by columns. The function is not correctly identifying the columns when grouping by the "x" label. This is causing a KeyError to be raised, which is unexpected.

The issue seems to be related to the way the function is handling the "by" argument when grouping by columns. It is not correctly identifying the columns as the grouping key.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the type of the key and how it handles the grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the columns as the grouping key when the "by" argument is provided for grouping by columns. This may involve modifying the logic for handling the "by" argument and ensuring that it correctly identifies the columns as the grouping key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if match_axis_length:
            groupings = []
            exclusions = []

            for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
                ping = Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=gpr,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)

            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, exclusions, obj
        else:
            raise ValueError("Length of keys must be the same as the axis length")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type for grouping")

```

This corrected code should correctly handle the grouping by columns and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
