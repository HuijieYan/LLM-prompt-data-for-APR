The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list of keys, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access the keys in the DataFrame.

The function should properly handle the case when `key` is a list of keys and create a Grouping for each key, combined into a BaseGrouper.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate over each key in the list, create a Grouping for each key, and then combine them into a BaseGrouper. Additionally, it should handle the case when `level` is a list or tuple, and create Groupings for each level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle the case when level is a list or tuple
        if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
            levels = level
        else:
            levels = [level]

    if key is None:
        keys = [group_axis]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Create the Grouping for each key
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code should handle the case when `key` is a list of keys and create the appropriate Groupings for each key, resolving the `KeyError` issue.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
