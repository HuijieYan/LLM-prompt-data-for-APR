1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for grouping data along columns, and the issue is about the groupby() function not working as expected when trying to group by columns.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the presence of the key in the object and raises a KeyError if it is not found.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by columns, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the key is a valid column name before attempting to group by it
   - Handling the grouping by columns in a separate conditional block to ensure it is processed correctly
   - Ensuring that the function can handle grouping by both index and columns without raising errors

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, we specifically handle the case where the axis is 1 (columns) and the key is a string that exists in the columns of the object. We then assign the corresponding column to the key variable. This ensures that the function correctly handles grouping by columns and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
