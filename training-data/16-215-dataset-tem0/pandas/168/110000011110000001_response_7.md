The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to group the DataFrame `df` by the column name 'x' using the `groupby` method with `axis=1`. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column name 'x'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list of keys, as indicated by the error message showing `key = ['x']`.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the case when `key` is a list of keys properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column name 'x'.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of keys and ensure that it can correctly group by multiple keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
                )
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now be able to handle the case when `key` is a list of keys and correctly group by multiple keys. This should make the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` pass.
