1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is trying to group the DataFrame along the columns using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter. The error message indicates a KeyError is being raised when trying to group by the columns.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the validity of the passed single level and determines whether the grouping should be based on the index or the columns.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the grouping by columns when using the `axis=1` parameter. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which indicate that a KeyError is being raised when trying to group by the columns.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle grouping by columns when `axis=1` is specified.
   - Ensure that the function properly checks for the validity of the passed single level and determines whether the grouping should be based on the index or the columns.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if key not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(key)
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            for k in key:
                if k not in obj.columns:
                    raise KeyError(k)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code includes a check for the `axis` parameter and the `key` parameter to ensure that when grouping by columns (`axis=1`), the key(s) provided are valid column names. This should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to group by columns.
