The issue is caused by the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling the grouping by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1. This results in a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when grouping by columns. It incorrectly processes the input parameters and does not create the BaseGrouper as expected.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when grouping by columns. This involves checking the input parameters and creating the BaseGrouper accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]
        group_axis = obj[key]
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code checks if the `axis` is set to 1 and a `key` is provided. If so, it creates the `group_axis` based on the columns specified by the `key`. Otherwise, it falls back to the original behavior of getting the group axis based on the specified axis.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and correctly handle the grouping by columns.
