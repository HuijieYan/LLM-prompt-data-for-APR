The issue is related to the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series) with the `Series` class. The failing test is expecting the same behavior for all types of indexers, but the actual behavior is different for the list indexer, which is causing the test to fail.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, where the different types of indexers are being handled. The function is not treating the list indexer the same way as other types of indexers, leading to the inconsistency in behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and make the function pass the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency in behavior and making the function pass the failing test.

This fix should also address the issue posted in the GitHub bug report, as it ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
