1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class. It is responsible for handling different types of keys and returning the appropriate values. It calls the `_slice` and `_get_values_tuple` methods from the same class, as well as the `reindex` method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check the type of the `key` parameter and determine the appropriate action based on its type.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the conditional statements not handling all possible types of `key` correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access the values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditional statements to ensure they cover all possible types of `key` and handle them appropriately.
   - Checking the return types of the methods being called (`_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, `reindex`) to ensure they match the expected return type of the `_get_with` method.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been reorganized to cover all possible types of `key` and handle them appropriately. Additionally, a catch-all `else` statement has been added to raise a `TypeError` for unsupported key types.
