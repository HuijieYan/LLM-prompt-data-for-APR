The issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. The function is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, which is causing the KeyError to be raised.

The problem seems to be in the section of the code where it checks if the key is a list-like object. The function is not handling the list-like key correctly and is not falling back to positional indexing as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code where it checks if the key is a list-like object and ensure that it falls back to positional indexing when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the list-like key correctly and ensure that it falls back to positional indexing when necessary. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
