The buggy function is `_get_with` which is a method of the `Series` class. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected `KeyError` is not being raised.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the handling of the `key` parameter. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the different types of `key` that are being passed to it.

The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of different types of `key` parameters within the `_get_with` function. The function should be able to handle different types of `key` parameters, such as lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series, but it is currently failing to do so.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to correctly handle the different types of `key` parameters that are being passed to it. This may involve adding conditional statements to handle each type of `key` parameter separately and perform the appropriate operations based on the type of `key`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle the different types of `key` parameters correctly and pass the failing test.
