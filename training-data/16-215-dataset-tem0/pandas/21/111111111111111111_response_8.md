The issue is related to the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list. The behavior is inconsistent with the behavior when `key` is an array-like index or a pandas Index. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised, but the actual behavior is different.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic that handles the different types of `key`. It seems that the function is not handling the list type correctly, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the list type of `key` correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior when compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling the different types of `key` needs to be revised to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the list type of `key` correctly and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test cases.
