The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input parameter `key` correctly. It is not identifying the type of the key and processing it accordingly.

The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised, but the function is not raising it, indicating that the function is not handling the input key correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly identify the type of the key and process it accordingly. We also need to ensure that the function raises a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle different types of keys correctly and raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
