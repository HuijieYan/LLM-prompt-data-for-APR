The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate result. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the function when a list, ndarray, Index, or Series is used as an indexer. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when a list is used as an indexer.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the function when different types of indexers are used, specifically pointing out that using a list as an indexer results in a KeyError, while using other types of indexers does not.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the case when the indexer is not list-like. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing test. This fix also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
