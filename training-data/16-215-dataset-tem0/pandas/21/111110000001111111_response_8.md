The issue seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The problem seems to be in the section of the code where it checks for the type of the key and how it handles list-like keys. The function should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the function not properly handling list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that list indexers are processed correctly and do not raise errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
