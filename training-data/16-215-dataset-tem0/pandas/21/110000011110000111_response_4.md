The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, such as list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when using a list indexer.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, specifically pointing out that using a list indexer results in a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not.

The potential error location within the function is the block of code that handles the case when the key is not list-like. It seems that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError when it shouldn't.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError when it shouldn't. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
