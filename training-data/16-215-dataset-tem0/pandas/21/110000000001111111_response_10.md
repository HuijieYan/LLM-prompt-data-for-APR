The issue seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the input is a list. The GitHub issue title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" suggests that there is inconsistency in how the function handles different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `key` variable when it is a list. It seems that the function is not treating list indexers the same way it treats other types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that using a list as an indexer leads to different behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve updating the logic for handling list indexers to align with the behavior of other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
