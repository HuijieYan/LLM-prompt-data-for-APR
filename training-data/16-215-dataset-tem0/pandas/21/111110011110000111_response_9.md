1. The buggy function is a method called `_get_with` within the `Series` class. It is used to retrieve values from the series based on the provided key. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series is used as the key. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a KeyError as expected when using a list as the key. The GitHub issue title and description further explain the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the case when the key is not list-like. It seems that the function is not handling the list-like key properly, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_get_with` function is not handling list-like keys properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
   - Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently and that the KeyError is raised when necessary.
   - Update the function to handle list-like keys in a similar manner to other types of indexers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code should handle list-like keys consistently and raise a KeyError when necessary, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
