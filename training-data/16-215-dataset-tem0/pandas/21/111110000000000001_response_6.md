1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class. It is responsible for retrieving values from the series based on the provided key. The function checks the type of the key and then performs different operations based on the type.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the key type and the subsequent operations based on the type.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling all possible types of keys correctly, leading to potential errors in retrieving values from the series. The function is trying to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists, but the handling is not comprehensive and may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that all possible types of keys are handled correctly and consistently.
   - Adding proper error handling for unsupported key types.
   - Refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, all possible types of keys are handled consistently, and proper error handling is added for unsupported key types. The code is refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
