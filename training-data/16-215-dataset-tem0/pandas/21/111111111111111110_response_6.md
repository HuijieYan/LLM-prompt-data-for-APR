The issue in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner. We can achieve this by updating the logic to properly handle list-like keys and ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys consistently
    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like keys consistently and ensure that the behavior is the same across different types of indexers.

This fix should address the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
