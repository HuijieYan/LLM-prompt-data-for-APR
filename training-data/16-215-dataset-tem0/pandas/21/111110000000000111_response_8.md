1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. It is used for indexing and retrieving values from a Series object. The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the `_get_with` function when using different types of indexers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of list indexers, which is causing inconsistency in behavior when compared to array-like indexers.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `_get_with` function is responsible for handling different types of indexers, including list indexers.
   (b). The `Series` class is designed to handle various types of indexers, but the handling of list indexers is causing inconsistency in behavior.
   (c). The GitHub issue information indicates that when using list indexers, the `_get_with` function is not behaving consistently and is raising a KeyError in some cases.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function and ensure it aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers.
   - Update the handling of list indexers to match the behavior of other indexers, ensuring consistency in the retrieval of values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, the handling of list indexers has been simplified to ensure consistency with the behavior of other indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
