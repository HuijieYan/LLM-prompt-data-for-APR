The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The function is not handling the list indexer correctly, which leads to the KeyError in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not treating the list indexer the same way as other types of indexers. This inconsistency is causing the KeyError to be raised when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the list indexer in the same way as other types of indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior and resolve the KeyError issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, and the failing test should pass. Additionally, this fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post.
