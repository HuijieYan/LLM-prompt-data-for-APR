Potential error location: The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of the key parameter in the _get_with function. The function is trying to handle different types of keys, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others, but the logic for handling these different types of keys is not clear.

Bug's cause: The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of the key parameter and the lack of clear logic for different key types in the _get_with function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add clear logic for handling different types of keys, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.
2. Use appropriate conditional statements to handle each type of key separately.
3. Ensure that the function calls related functions with the correct parameters and handles their return values appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected code, the logic for handling different types of keys has been clarified and appropriate conditional statements have been used to handle each type of key separately. The function now calls related functions with the correct parameters and handles their return values appropriately.
