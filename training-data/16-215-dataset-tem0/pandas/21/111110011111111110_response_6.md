The issue in the provided code is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like key properly. We can achieve this by checking if the key is a list or an ndarray, and then using the `loc` method to perform the indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will now handle list-like keys properly and provide consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. This should resolve the failing test cases and the reported issue.
