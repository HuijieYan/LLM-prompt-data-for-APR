The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input key correctly. It is not identifying the type of the key and processing it accordingly, which is causing the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _get_with function to correctly handle the different types of keys that it can receive. We can use the isinstance function to check the type of the key and process it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the _get_with function should now handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test cases.
