The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. The function is trying to determine the type of the `key` and perform different operations based on its type. However, it is not handling all possible types correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

The failing test is trying to access a key that does not exist in the index, and the function is not handling this case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to properly handle the different types of keys and ensure that it handles the case where the key does not exist in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where the key does not exist in the index
    if not key.isin(self.index).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle the different types of keys and handle the case where the key does not exist in the index. This should allow the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
