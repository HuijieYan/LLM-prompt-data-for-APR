The issue in the buggy function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised for all types of indexers, but the function is not raising the error for list indexers.

The bug is caused by the function not handling list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and failing the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and raising a KeyError when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Raise a KeyError when there are no matches in the index
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and passing the failing test. This also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
