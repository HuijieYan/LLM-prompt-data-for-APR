The buggy function is `apply` which is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hour offset. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, which suggests that the adjustment logic is not correctly aligning with the custom business hour frequency.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustment of the datetime based on the business hour offset, leading to a mismatch in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that it aligns with the custom business hour frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_datetime = other

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_datetime = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(other)
                adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

        # Adjusting for business days
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
        adjusted_datetime = adjusted_datetime + skip_bd

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code ensures that the adjustment logic aligns with the custom business hour frequency and should pass the failing test.
