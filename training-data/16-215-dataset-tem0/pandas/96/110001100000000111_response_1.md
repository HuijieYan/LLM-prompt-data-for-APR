1. The buggy function is part of the pandas library and is used to apply custom business hours to a datetime object. The related functions in the same file are used to manipulate datetime objects based on business hours and offsets. The GitHub issue is related to using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays, which results in unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the behavior is unexpected when using periods and adding holidays.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function. The function should adjust the datetime object based on business hours and holidays, but it seems to be producing unexpected results when holidays are added. This is likely due to a flaw in the logic for adjusting the datetime object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on holidays and business hours to ensure it is correctly handling the addition of holidays.
   - Checking for any edge cases or special conditions related to holidays that may not be properly handled in the current implementation.
   - Testing the function with different holiday configurations to identify the specific scenario causing the unexpected behavior.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and holidays
        # ... (existing logic)

        # adjust for holidays
        for holiday in self.holidays:
            if other.date() == holiday:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # remaining logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours
        # ... (existing logic)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we have added a loop to check for holidays and adjust the datetime object accordingly. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that holidays are properly handled when applying custom business hours to a datetime object.
