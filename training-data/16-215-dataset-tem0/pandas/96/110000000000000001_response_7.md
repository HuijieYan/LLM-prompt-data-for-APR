1. The buggy function is designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours. However, there are several potential issues within the function that could be causing the bug.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the calculation and adjustment of the business hours and the datetime object.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect calculations and adjustments of the business hours and the datetime object, leading to incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for adjusting business hours and the datetime object
   - Checking for any off-by-one errors in the calculations
   - Ensuring that the adjustments are correctly applied based on the business hours

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustments for business hours and the datetime object have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure correct output. The logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours has been modified to address the potential bug.
