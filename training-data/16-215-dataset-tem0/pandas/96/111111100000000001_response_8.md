1. The buggy function is called "apply" and it is part of the "BusinessHourMixin" class. The function is supposed to apply business hours to a given datetime object. It calls several related functions from the same class and file to perform the necessary calculations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation and adjustment of the datetime object "other" based on the business hours and offsets.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect calculations and adjustments of the "other" datetime object within the "apply" function. This could be due to incorrect logic in handling positive and negative business hours, as well as the adjustment of the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours. The related functions within the same class and file are used to perform these calculations and adjustments.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for handling positive and negative business hours and ensuring that the adjustments to the datetime object are correctly implemented.
   - Checking the calculations for business days and remaining business hours to ensure they are accurate.
   - Verifying the usage of related functions within the "apply" function to make sure they are correctly applied.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling positive and negative business hours, as well as the adjustments to the datetime object "other" based on business days and remaining business hours, has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure correctness. The related functions within the same class are used as before, but the logic within the "apply" function has been modified to address the potential bug.
