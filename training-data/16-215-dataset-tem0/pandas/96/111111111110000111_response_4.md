The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is used to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but it is producing more periods than expected. The error message indicates a ValueError is being raised during frequency validation.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays to the custom business hour frequency results in more periods than expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays, as this is where the discrepancy in periods is occurring.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it handles holidays correctly and produces the expected number of periods.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

class BusinessHourMixin:
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the issue and ensure that the `apply` function works as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.
