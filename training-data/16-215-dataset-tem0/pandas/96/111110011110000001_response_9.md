The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, but it is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

The potential error location within the `apply` function is likely related to the adjustment of the `other` datetime based on the business hours and days. It seems that the adjustment logic is not handling the custom business hour frequency correctly, leading to the frequency validation error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be revised to properly handle the custom business hour frequency. This may involve ensuring that the adjustment logic is compatible with the custom business hour frequency and that it correctly handles the edge cases related to business days and hours.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjustment logic for custom business hour frequency
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            # Calculate the adjusted datetime based on the custom business hour frequency
            adjusted_datetime = self.rollforward(other)
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            # Original adjustment logic for other types of business hours
            # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we have added a conditional check for the custom business hour frequency and used the `rollforward` method to calculate the adjusted datetime based on the custom business hour frequency. This should address the frequency validation issue and make the failing test pass.
