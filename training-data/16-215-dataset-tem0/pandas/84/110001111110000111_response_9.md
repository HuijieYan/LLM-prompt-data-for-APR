The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The error is caused by the function trying to find the index of a tuple name in the MultiIndex, which is not supported.

The failing test cases are trying to unstack a MultiIndex using tuple names, which is not currently supported by the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle unstacking with tuple names in the MultiIndex.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle unstacking with tuple names in the MultiIndex by checking the type of the level and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function will be able to handle unstacking with tuple names in the MultiIndex.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
