The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` which is used to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function is trying to unstack the DataFrame based on the specified level, but it is encountering errors related to the level names and indices.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to access a level that is not found in the MultiIndex. This is likely due to the way the function is handling the level names and indices.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is trying to get the level number for each specified level, but it seems to be encountering issues with the level names.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the MultiIndex level names and indices correctly, leading to errors when trying to unstack the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the MultiIndex level names and indices, ensuring that it can correctly identify and access the specified levels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to handle both string and tuple inputs for the level names. This ensures that the function can correctly identify the level numbers for the specified levels.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and handle the MultiIndex levels properly.
