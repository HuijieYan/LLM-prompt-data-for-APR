The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the pandas library. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `quantile` method when called on a DataFrame containing datetime data. The error message indicates a ValueError related to concatenation, which suggests that the issue may be related to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` method.

The GitHub issue title "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" provides additional context, indicating that the `quantile` method is not working as expected when applied to datetime data in a DataFrame.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is likely related to the handling of datetime data and the concatenation of arrays.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method needs to be updated to handle datetime data correctly and avoid the ValueError related to concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code should address the issue with the `quantile` method and allow it to handle datetime data correctly. It should also pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
