1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The related functions are `_constructor` and `quantile` within the same class, which are not the same as the buggy function but have the same name. The GitHub issue indicates that the `quantile` method is broken when dealing with datetime data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `result = data._data.quantile(...)` line, where the `quantile` method is being called on the `data` object.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the `quantile` method not handling datetime data correctly, leading to a `ValueError` when trying to concatenate the results. The GitHub issue provides an example where the `quantile` method works fine with a Series of datetime data but raises an error with a DataFrame of datetime data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the data type of the input and handling datetime data differently within the `quantile` method.
   - Modifying the `quantile` method to handle datetime data in a way that prevents the `ValueError` from occurring.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data._is_datetime_or_timedelta:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed, numeric_only=numeric_only)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code includes a check for datetime or timedelta data and handles it differently within the `quantile` method to prevent the `ValueError` from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
