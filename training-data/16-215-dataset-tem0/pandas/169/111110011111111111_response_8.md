The issue is occurring in the `quantile` function of the `DataFrame` class. The function is not handling datetime data correctly, which is causing it to fail when trying to concatenate the data.

The problem seems to be related to the `data._data.quantile` call, where it is trying to concatenate the data but failing because there is no array to concatenate.

The failing test is trying to call `df.quantile(0.5)` and `df.quantile([0.5])` on a DataFrame with datetime data, and it is expecting the result to be a Series and a DataFrame respectively. However, the current implementation of the `quantile` function is not handling datetime data properly, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function needs to handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output for the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the `quantile` function should now handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output for the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
