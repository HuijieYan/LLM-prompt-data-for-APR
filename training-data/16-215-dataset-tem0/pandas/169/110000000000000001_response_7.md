1. The buggy function is a method for calculating quantiles in a pandas DataFrame or Series. It takes in parameters such as the quantile value, axis, whether to consider only numeric data, and the interpolation method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the quantile using the `data._data.quantile()` method. This is where the bug is likely to be located.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `data._data.quantile()` method, which may not be handling the input parameters correctly, leading to unexpected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the input parameters and ensuring they are correctly passed to the `data._data.quantile()` method.
   - Verifying the logic for transposing the data and handling the result accordingly.
   - Ensuring that the result is returned in the appropriate format based on the input parameters.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `data.quantile()` method is used to calculate the quantile, and the result is transposed if the input `q` is an array. The logic for handling transposed data and returning the result in the appropriate format has been adjusted.
