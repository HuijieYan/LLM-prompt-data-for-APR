The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling datetime data correctly, which is causing the failing test. The function is not returning the expected output for datetime data, and it is failing to concatenate the arrays when trying to compute the quantile.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling datetime data properly, and it is not returning the expected output for datetime data. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which indicates that there is a ValueError due to the need for at least one array to concatenate.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output for datetime data. Additionally, the function needs to handle the concatenation of arrays properly to compute the quantile.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output for datetime data. It should also handle the concatenation of arrays properly to compute the quantile.

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
