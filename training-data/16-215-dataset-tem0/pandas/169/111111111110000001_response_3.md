The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The failing test is in the `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` method in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` file.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate" in the `concat_compat` function in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file. This error occurs when attempting to concatenate arrays, suggesting that the `quantile` method is not returning the expected result.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is likely in the `result = data._data.quantile(...)` line, where the `quantile` method is being called on the `data` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the `quantile` method not returning the expected result, leading to an empty array being passed to the `concat` function, resulting in the `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method should be modified to ensure that it returns the expected result, either as a Series or DataFrame, based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected code, the `quantile` method should return the expected result, passing the failing test.
