The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `is_overlapping` attribute and the comparison of `target_as_index` with `self`. The function is intended to return an indexer based on the comparison of the input `target` with the `self` IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The function is not correctly handling the comparison of `target_as_index` with `self` when `is_overlapping` is False.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the comparison of non-overlapping `target_as_index` with `self`. It is also not properly handling the case when `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex and handle the comparison accordingly. It should also handle the case when `is_overlapping` is False and provide the correct indexer based on the comparison of `target_as_index` with `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex and handle the comparison accordingly. If it is an IntervalIndex and is not equal to `self`, we return an indexer with -1 values. Otherwise, we handle the comparison by getting the location of each key in `target_as_index` and appending it to the indexer. Finally, we return the indexer after ensuring its platform compatibility.
