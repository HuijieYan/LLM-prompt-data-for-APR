The buggy function is attempting to handle overlapping indices and perform matching operations on IntervalIndex objects. However, it seems to be encountering issues with the logic and implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following points:

1. The function is checking for overlapping indices using `self.is_overlapping`. However, `is_overlapping` is a method, not a property. We need to call the method to get the actual boolean value.

2. The function is attempting to compare IntervalIndex objects and perform matching operations. We need to ensure that the comparison and matching logic is correctly implemented.

3. The function is using various attributes and methods of the IntervalIndex class, such as `left`, `right`, `dtype`, and `values`. We need to ensure that these attributes and methods are correctly utilized in the context of the function's logic.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:

1. We are now calling `self.is_overlapping()` to get the actual boolean value of overlapping indices.

2. We have fixed the comparison and matching logic for IntervalIndex objects.

3. We have ensured that the attributes and methods of the IntervalIndex class are correctly utilized in the context of the function's logic.

These changes should address the issues with the buggy function and provide the expected behavior.
