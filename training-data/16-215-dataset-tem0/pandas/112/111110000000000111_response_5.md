1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is part of the `IntervalIndex` class, which is used to create an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This indicates that there is a problem with the `get_indexer` function when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.

2. The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function could be in the logic that handles the different types of indexes and their corresponding operations.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `get_indexer` function is responsible for returning an indexer array that can be used to index into the target array. It seems that the logic within this function is not handling `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` correctly, leading to the failure of the `round` method.
   (b). The `IntervalIndex` class is used to create immutable indexes of intervals, and the issue is related to the behavior of the `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem, stating that the `round` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, and it is expected to work as normal.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and update the logic within the `get_indexer` function to handle `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` correctly.
   - Ensure that the `get_indexer` function works seamlessly with different types of indexes, including `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
   - Test the `round` method with `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` to verify that the issue has been resolved.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
    else:
        # Handle other types of indexes
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `get_indexer` function has been updated to handle `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` correctly. It now checks for both `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` types and returns the indexer array accordingly. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
