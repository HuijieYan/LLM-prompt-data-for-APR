The buggy function is `get_indexer`. It is used to get the indexer for a target index based on the current index. The function seems to be failing when the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the case for `IntervalIndex`. It seems to be encountering a TypeError when trying to perform the `round` operation on the CategoricalIndex made from the IntervalIndex.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not handling the case of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to perform the `round` operation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This may involve adding a conditional check to handle this specific case and perform the necessary operations to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we added a conditional check to handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, we extract the IntervalIndex from the CategoricalIndex and continue with the rest of the function as usual.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and handle the case of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly.
