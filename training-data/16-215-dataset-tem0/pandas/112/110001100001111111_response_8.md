The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexes and perform operations accordingly. However, it seems to fail when dealing with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks for the type of the target_as_index. It seems that the function is not handling the case where the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not properly handling the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a TypeError when trying to perform the round operation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case where the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This may involve adding a conditional check to properly handle this specific case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # handle IntervalIndex case
        # ... (existing code for handling IntervalIndex)

    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # handle other cases
        # ... (existing code for handling other cases)

    else:
        # handle remaining cases
        # ... (existing code for handling remaining cases)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case where the target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and the round method should work as expected, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
