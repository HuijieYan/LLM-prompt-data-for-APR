The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaTType.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `column_op` function, specifically in the cases where the right operand is a scalar or a Series. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the multiplication operation, so the problem is likely in the implementation of the `column_op` function for the multiplication operation.

The bug's cause is that the `column_op` function is not handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series containing NaT values correctly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the multiplication operation with NaT values correctly. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for NaT values and handling them appropriately in the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not b.isna().any() else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected code, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the multiplication operation with NaT values correctly and pass the failing test.
