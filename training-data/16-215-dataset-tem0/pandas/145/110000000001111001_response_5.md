The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the 'right' input parameter, which is a Series with a datetime dtype. The function is not correctly handling the Series input when the axis is set to 'columns'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'column_op' function to handle the case when 'right' is a Series and the axis is set to 'columns'. We also need to ensure that the returned DataFrame has the correct values and types for the variables 'a', 'b', 'a.columns', and 'expressions'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = pd.api.types.to_numeric(right, errors='coerce')

    if axis == "columns" and isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    return new_data
```

This corrected code should handle the case when 'right' is a Series and the axis is set to 'columns', and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
