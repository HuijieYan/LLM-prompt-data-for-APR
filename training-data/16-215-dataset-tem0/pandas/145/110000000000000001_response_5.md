1. The buggy function is designed to evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes in parameters such as left (DataFrame), right (scalar or DataFrame), func (arithmetic or comparison operator), str_rep (string or None), and axis (None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"). The function then performs operations based on the type of 'right' input and returns a DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statements that check the type of 'right' input and determine the appropriate column operation to be performed.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statements for checking the type of 'right' input and determining the appropriate column operation to be performed are not handling all possible cases, leading to potential errors in the function's execution.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding additional conditional statements to handle all possible cases for the 'right' input.
   - Ensuring that the appropriate column operation is selected based on the type of 'right' input and the axis parameter.
   - Handling all cases where the type of 'right' input is not currently being handled, such as raising a NotImplementedError for those cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """

    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator

    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, additional conditional statements have been added to handle all possible cases for the 'right' input. The appropriate column operation is selected based on the type of 'right' input and the axis parameter. Cases where the type of 'right' input is not currently being handled are now handled by raising a NotImplementedError.
