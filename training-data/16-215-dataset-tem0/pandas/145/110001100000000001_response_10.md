1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It calls the `column_op` function based on the type of the `right` parameter.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that determine the type of the `right` parameter and then define the `column_op` function accordingly.

3. The bug's cause is that the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times within the `dispatch_to_series` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. This can cause confusion and make the code difficult to maintain.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the `column_op` function only once outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function and pass it as an argument to the `expressions.evaluate` function.
   - Use a single conditional statement to determine the type of the `right` parameter and define the `column_op` function accordingly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def column_op(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        pass
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function is defined outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function, and it is passed as an argument to the `expressions.evaluate` function. This ensures that the `column_op` function is defined only once and eliminates the redefinition issue.
