The potential error in the function is the use of double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the actual output to differ from the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
