The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The function is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes from the key-value pairs when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list without adding unnecessary quotes. This should resolve the failing tests and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
