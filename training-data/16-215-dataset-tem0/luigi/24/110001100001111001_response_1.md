The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list. It is adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not expected.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
