The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command arguments. The function is currently adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the test failures.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs by adding double quotes around them.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the key-value pairs and only add the key-value pairs to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command arguments without adding unnecessary double quotes. This should make the function pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
