The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The issue arises from the fact that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list.

The failing test cases are failing because the expected command list includes arguments with quotes around the property and value, while the actual command list does not have quotes around the property and value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding quotes around the property and value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function will construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the property and value, and it should pass the failing test cases.
