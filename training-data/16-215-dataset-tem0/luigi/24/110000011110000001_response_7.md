The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take in a name and a value, and if the value is a dictionary, it constructs a command by iterating over the dictionary items and appending them to the command list. The issue with the function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items as strings with double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The failing test cases are failing because the expected command list is not matching the actual command list due to the incorrect formatting of dictionary items as strings with double quotes.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` needs to be modified to correctly format the dictionary items without double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the dictionary items without double quotes, and the failing test cases should pass.
