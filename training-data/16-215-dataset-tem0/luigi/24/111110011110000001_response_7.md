The problematic function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The issue arises from the fact that it is adding double quotes around the property and value, which is causing the test to fail.

The failing test is checking the command line arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function, and it is failing because the expected list of arguments does not match the actual list of arguments. The error message indicates that the difference is due to the presence of double quotes around the property and value in the actual list of arguments.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed from around the property and value in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now generate the command line arguments without the unnecessary double quotes, and the failing test should pass.
