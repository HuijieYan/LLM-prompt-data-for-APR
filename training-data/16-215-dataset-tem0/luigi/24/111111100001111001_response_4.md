The potential error in the buggy function is the way the command list is being constructed. The function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The function is not adding quotes around the key-value pairs, as expected in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the command list. We should add quotes around each key-value pair in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
