The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType` and it is being used in an addition operation with an integer.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` function is called, it tries to perform an addition operation with `None` and an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is not provided when creating a new `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if it is not provided, which will prevent the `NoneType` error when the `prune` function is called.
