1. The buggy function is the constructor for a class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. It initializes various attributes of the class, such as worker_id, last_active, reference, started, tasks, and info.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time.time() function without importing the time module. This will result in a NameError when trying to access time.time().

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is not imported, so the time.time() function cannot be accessed within the class.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include importing the time module at the beginning of the file and using time.time() to initialize the 'started' attribute.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import time  # import the time module

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file, the time.time() function can be accessed and used to initialize the 'started' attribute within the class.
