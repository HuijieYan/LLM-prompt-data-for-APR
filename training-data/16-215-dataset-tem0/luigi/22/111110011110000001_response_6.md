1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test is trying to call the `prune` method on an instance of the `Worker` class, which is resulting in a `TypeError` due to the `last_active` attribute being `None`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `self.last_active` attribute, which is being initialized as `None`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is being set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, and then the failing test is trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, resulting in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

4. To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with a default value that is not `None`, such as `0` or the current time.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, and the failing test should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
