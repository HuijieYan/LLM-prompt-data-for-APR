The potential error in the buggy function is that it is using the `time` module without importing it. This will result in a NameError when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the `time` module at the beginning of the file, the bug is fixed and the `time.time()` function can be used without any issues.
