The issue with the buggy function is that it is missing the import statement for the `time` module, which is used to access the `time.time()` function. This is causing the function to fail when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we need to add the import statement for the `time` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
