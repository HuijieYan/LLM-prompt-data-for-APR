```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add your logic here
```
The issue was that the `last_active` parameter was not being checked for `None` before assigning the current time to it. This caused the TypeError when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method. The corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and assigns the current time if it is.
