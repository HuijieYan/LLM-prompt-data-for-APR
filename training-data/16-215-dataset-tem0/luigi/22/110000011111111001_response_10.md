The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # prune the worker
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp. This will fix the `TypeError` issue and make the function pass the failing test.
