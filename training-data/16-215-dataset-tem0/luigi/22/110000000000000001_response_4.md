1. The buggy function is an initialization function for a class, but it is missing the import statement for the time module.

2. The potential error location is the line "self.started = time.time()" because the time module has not been imported.

3. The bug's cause is that the time module has not been imported, so the function call to time.time() will result in an error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to import the time module at the beginning of the file. Then we can use the time module to get the current time.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file, we can now use the time.time() function to get the current time and initialize the "started" attribute of the Worker class correctly.
