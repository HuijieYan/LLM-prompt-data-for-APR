1. The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It is responsible for initializing the attributes of the Worker object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the time.time() method without importing the time module.

3. The bug's cause is that the time module is not imported, so the time.time() method cannot be used without it.

4. To fix the bug, the time module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By importing the time module at the beginning of the file, the time.time() method can be used to initialize the 'started' attribute of the Worker object.
