The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where `last_active` is `None` when the `Worker` object is initialized. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method. We can use `time.time()` as the default value if `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided, and the `prune` method should work as expected without causing a `TypeError`.
