The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType` and it is being used in an addition operation with an integer.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time when it is not provided as an argument in the `__init__` function. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer and can be used in the addition operation in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # prune the worker
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always an integer. This will allow the `prune` method to execute without a TypeError and pass the failing test.
