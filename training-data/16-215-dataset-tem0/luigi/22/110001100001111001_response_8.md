The bug in the provided function is that it is missing the import statement for the `time` module, which is used to access the `time.time()` function. This is causing the function to fail when trying to access `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to add the import statement for the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now be able to access the `time.time()` function and set the `self.started` variable to the current time in seconds since epoch, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
