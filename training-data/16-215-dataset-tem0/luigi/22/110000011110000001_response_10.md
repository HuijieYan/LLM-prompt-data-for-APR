1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it, passing a `TmpCfg` object as an argument. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is `None`) to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

2. The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default.

3. The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Set a default value for `last_active` that is an integer representing the seconds since epoch, instead of `None`.
   - Modify the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.

5. Corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, and the `prune` method should be able to handle this correctly.
