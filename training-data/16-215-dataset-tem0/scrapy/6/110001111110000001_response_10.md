The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a different format and size. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images with different formats and sizes.

The potential error in the `convert_image` function is that it does not handle the case when the input image is in RGBA mode and PNG format correctly. It attempts to convert the image to RGB without considering the transparency channel, resulting in incorrect color values.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting them to RGB. The failing test specifically checks for the color values after the conversion, and since the conversion is incorrect, the test fails.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle RGBA images differently. It should preserve the transparency channel when converting from RGBA to RGB.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle RGBA images correctly and pass the failing test.
