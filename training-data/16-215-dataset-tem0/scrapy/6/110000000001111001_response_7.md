The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the input image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB' properly. It should not convert the image in this case, but the function currently converts it to 'RGB' and saves it as a JPEG, which is unnecessary.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to only convert the image to 'RGB' and save it as JPEG if the input format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. Otherwise, it should just save the image without any conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle all the input cases as expected and return the correct output values.
