1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a different format and size. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images with different formats and sizes. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the converted image does not match the expected result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The code inside this conditional block may not be handling the conversion correctly.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode is not correctly converting the image to RGB mode. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the converted image to have specific colors, but the actual result is different.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode correctly handles the conversion to RGB mode.
   - Checking the thumbnail generation to ensure that the image ratio is maintained.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode now creates a new RGB background and pastes the RGBA image onto it before converting it to RGB mode.
- The thumbnail generation now includes `ImageOps.exif_transpose` to handle the image orientation correctly.
