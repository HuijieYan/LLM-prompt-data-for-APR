The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The function is responsible for converting images to the appropriate format and size. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the behavior of the `convert_image` function for different image types and sizes.

The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected colors of the converted images are not matching the actual colors. This suggests that the image conversion logic in the `convert_image` function is incorrect.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conditional block that checks for the image format and mode. The logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode seems to be incorrect, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be revised. Additionally, the logic for converting the image to the appropriate format and size should be reviewed to ensure that it produces the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode has been updated to create a new RGB image with a white background and paste the original image onto it.
- The mode conversion logic has been adjusted to ensure that the image is converted to RGB when necessary.
- The resulting image and buffer are returned as a tuple, and the buffer is reset to the beginning before being returned.
