The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. The function is supposed to create a new image with a white background and then convert it to RGB mode. However, the current implementation is not doing this correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. We also need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where a size is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now handle the different cases correctly and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
