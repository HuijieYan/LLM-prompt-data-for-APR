The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' correctly. It is creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it, but then converting it to 'RGB' instead of 'RGBA'.

To fix this, we need to update the function to convert the image to 'RGB' only if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the image mode is not 'RGB' or 'RGBA' by converting it to 'RGB'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle all the input cases correctly and produce the expected output values and types.
