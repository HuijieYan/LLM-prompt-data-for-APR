The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it is not handling the case where the input image is already in RGB mode and the format is JPEG. Additionally, the function is not correctly handling the thumbnail size when it is provided.

The bug is causing the failing test to produce incorrect results, as the function is not converting the image to the expected format and size.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the cases where the input image is already in the desired format and mode, and to properly handle the thumbnail size when provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should now handle the different cases correctly and produce the expected results for the failing test.
