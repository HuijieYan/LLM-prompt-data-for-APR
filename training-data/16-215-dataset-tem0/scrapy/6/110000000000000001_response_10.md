1. The buggy function is supposed to convert an image to a specific format and size, but it has several issues. 
2. The potential error location is within the if statement that checks for the image format and mode.
3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the image format and mode correctly, and it may not be resizing the image properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the image format and mode using the correct attributes and methods.
   - Ensure that the image is resized properly if a size is provided.
   - Use the correct method to save the image in the desired format.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The paste method is used with the correct parameters to paste the image onto the background.
- The buffer position is reset to the beginning before returning it.
