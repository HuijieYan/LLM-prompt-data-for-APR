1. The buggy function is the `info` function within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function `test_info` is testing this `info` function. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the version is being extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is returning 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just the version number. This is causing the incorrect output in the `info` function. The failing test is catching this discrepancy and the GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to a recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command to only return the version number without any additional text.
   - Update the `info` function to properly extract and format the version number.
   - Ensure that the `thefuck -v` command does not trigger a recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
