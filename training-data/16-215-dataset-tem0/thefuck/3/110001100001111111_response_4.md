The issue with the `info` function is that it is not properly capturing the version of the Fish shell. The function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but it is not capturing the correct output.

The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish. This suggests that the function is not returning the expected version of the Fish shell, which is causing the plugin to continuously try to regenerate functions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly capture the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use the `subprocess` module to capture the output of the `fish --version` command, which will provide the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the `subprocess` module to capture the output of the `fish --version` command and then formats it to return the correct version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
