The issue with the buggy function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes. It is missing the import statements for the Generic class and the Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL objects.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and classes at the beginning of the file. We also need to handle the case where the Popen command fails to execute properly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error getting Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the subprocess call properly and return the expected value and type of variables.
