The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct way to get the version. Additionally, the test is expecting the version string to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual output is '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to get the version and format the output string to match the expected value in the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
