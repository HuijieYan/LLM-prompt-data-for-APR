1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The test function is testing the `info` method of the `Fish` class, which is expected to return the version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function is incorrect, resulting in the unexpected output. The failing test is expecting the version number to be extracted from the output of the command, but the command itself is not correct.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure it returns only the version number without any additional text.
   - Modify the `info` function to correctly extract the version number from the command output.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the `info` function now uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and extracts only the version number from the output. This should make the function return the expected output and pass the failing test.
