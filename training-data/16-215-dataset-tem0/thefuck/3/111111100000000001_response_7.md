1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen without importing it from the subprocess module.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function is being used without importing it from the subprocess module. This causes a NameError because Popen is not defined within the current scope.

4. To fix the bug, the Popen function needs to be imported from the subprocess module. Additionally, it's a good practice to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the subprocess.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```
