1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is used to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggers a recursive loop because of this function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function to execute the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'". This command is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it seems to be causing a recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is that the "info" function is being called recursively when the "thefuck -v" command is executed, leading to a loop. This is indicated by the GitHub issue, which states that the use of the command triggers a recursive loop because of the "Fish.info()" function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking if the function is being called recursively and adding a condition to prevent it.
   - Modifying the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved to avoid the recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'FISH_VERSION' in os.environ:
            version = os.environ['FISH_VERSION']
        else:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'FISH_VERSION' environment variable is already set, and if so, we use that value. If not, we use the Popen function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This should prevent the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
