The issue with the buggy function is that it is not actually executing the command to get the Fish shell version. Instead, it is using a MagicMock object, which is likely a result of improper mocking in the test cases.

To fix this, we need to actually execute the command to get the Fish shell version. We can use the `subprocess` module to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly execute the command to get the Fish shell version and return the expected value and type of variables.
