1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "fish.py" file. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which in this case is the Fish shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the Popen function without importing it from the subprocess module.

3. The bug's cause is that the Popen function is being used without importing it from the subprocess module. This causes the code to fail because the Popen function is not recognized.

4. To fix the bug, the Popen function needs to be imported from the subprocess module. Additionally, it's a good practice to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the Popen function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error getting Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
