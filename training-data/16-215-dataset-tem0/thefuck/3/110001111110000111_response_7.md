1. The buggy function is `info` in the `fish.py` file. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file is testing this function. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. This causes the version string to include unnecessary text.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to a more accurate one.
   - Modify the function to extract the version number from the output of the command.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
