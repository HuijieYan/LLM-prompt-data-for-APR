The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The Popen command is using 'fish -c' to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the correct command to get the version is 'fish --version'.

The failing test is expecting the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual output is '3.5.9'. This is because the command used to get the version is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be updated to use 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the use of the 'thefuck -v' command triggering a recursive loop.
