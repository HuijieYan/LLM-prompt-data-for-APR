The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is being used, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command '--version'.

The bug's cause is that the function is not retrieving the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to '--version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
