1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish class in the fish.py file of the thefuck project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that the function thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, which suggests that there is a recursive loop triggered by this function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and read the output. This could be causing the recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the use of the Popen function to execute a command within the same shell, which could be triggering a recursive loop. The GitHub issue confirms that the function thefuck -v is causing the recursive loop, which is likely related to the execution of the command within the same shell.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Using a different method to retrieve the shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop.
   - Checking for the presence of the Oh-My-Fish plugin and handling it differently to avoid the recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

This corrected code uses the check_output function to execute the command and retrieve the shell version without triggering a recursive loop. It also includes error handling in case the command execution fails.
