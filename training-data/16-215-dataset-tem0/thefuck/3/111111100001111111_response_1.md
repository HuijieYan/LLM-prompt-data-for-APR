The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not returning the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not returning the expected version string. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version of the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being passed to Popen to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the command 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
