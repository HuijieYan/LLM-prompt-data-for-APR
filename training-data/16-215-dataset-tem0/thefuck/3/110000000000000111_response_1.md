1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish shell and is used to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue is related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin "TheFuck" which triggers a recursive loop due to the use of the `thefuck -v` command, ultimately leading to a hang in the Fish Shell initialization.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function without importing the subprocess module.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` function is used without importing the `subprocess` module, which leads to the function not being recognized. This causes the hang in the Fish Shell initialization when the `thefuck -v` command is triggered by the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the `subprocess` module to use the `Popen` function.
   - Handling any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By importing the `subprocess` module and using it to call the `Popen` function, the bug should be fixed and the function should now work as intended, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
