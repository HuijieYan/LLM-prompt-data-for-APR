1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the Popen function from the subprocess module. It is used to open a pipe to or from a command, but it is not being handled properly in the current implementation.

3. The bug's cause is that the Popen function is not being properly handled, and the output from the command is not being read correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly handling the Popen function, reading the output from the command, and handling any potential errors that may occur during the process.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we have used the communicate() method to read the output from the command and decode it properly. We have also handled any potential errors by using the DEVNULL parameter for stderr.
