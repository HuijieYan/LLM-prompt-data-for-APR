1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function "test_info" is testing this method by mocking the Popen function and asserting the output. The error message indicates that the expected output is not matching the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version not returning the expected output. The failing test is expecting the version number to be extracted from the output of the command, but it seems that the command is not returning the version number in the expected format. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to a recursive loop triggered by the "thefuck -v" command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Changing the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to ensure it returns the version number in the expected format.
   - Handling the recursive loop triggered by the "thefuck -v" command in a way that prevents it from causing issues with the "info" method.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected code uses the command "fish --version" to retrieve the Fish shell version and then extracts the version number from the output. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
