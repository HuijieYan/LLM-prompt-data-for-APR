1. The buggy function "info" is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and then reading the output. However, this is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as it triggers the regeneration of functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function without properly handling the process.

3. The bug is caused by the Popen function not being handled properly, leading to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The GitHub issue provides information that the problem is related to the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use a different method to get the Fish shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop.
   - Handle the Popen function properly to avoid the recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return "Unable to retrieve Fish shell version"
```

This corrected code uses the subprocess module to run the command to get the Fish shell version and properly handles any errors that may occur. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
