The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` class to execute a command in the shell and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the function is not returning the expected value, and it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the `version` variable is being assigned. It seems that the format of the version string is incorrect, and it is not returning the expected value.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the version string. The `info` function is not returning the expected value, which is causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly format the version string and return the expected value. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function does not cause a recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
