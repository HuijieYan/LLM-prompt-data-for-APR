The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. This is causing the version string to be incorrect, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version to 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
