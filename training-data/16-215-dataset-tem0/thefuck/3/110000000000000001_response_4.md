1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not doing so correctly.

2. The potential error location within the function is the use of Popen and proc.stdout.read().

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function is not being used correctly, and the stdout is not being read properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use subprocess.check_output instead of Popen to capture the output of the command.
   - Handle the exception if the 'fish' command is not found.
   - Use try-except block to catch any errors that may occur.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return 'Fish Shell version not found'
```

In the corrected code, we have used subprocess.check_output to capture the output of the 'fish' command, and we have added a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur.
