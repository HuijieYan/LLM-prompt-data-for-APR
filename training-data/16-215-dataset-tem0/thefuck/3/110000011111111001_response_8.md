The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the Popen call to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
