The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, it seems to be using a MagicMock object instead of actually running the command. This is likely the cause of the issue reported on GitHub, where the thefuck plugin triggers a recursive loop due to this function.

To fix the bug, the function should actually run the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected version of the Fish shell and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
