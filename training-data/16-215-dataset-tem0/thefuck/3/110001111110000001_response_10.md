The potential error in the `info` function is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the output of `fish --version`. This mismatch in the command used to retrieve the version is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function to match the expected output in the test.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the `info` function will now use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and it should pass the failing test.
