1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the Fish class. It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test is checking if the info method returns the correct version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the returned value includes extra text "fish, version" which is not expected. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the "thefuck" plugin with Oh-My-Fish, triggering a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. It seems to be returning additional text along with the version number.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using a subprocess call and then formatting the output to include the version number in the return value.
   (b) The failing test is checking if the info method returns the correct version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the returned value includes extra text "fish, version" which is not expected.
   (c) The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the "thefuck" plugin with Oh-My-Fish, triggering a recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the subprocess call to retrieve only the version number without any additional text.
   - Update the test to expect only the version number without any additional text.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return only the version number without any additional text. This should make the test pass and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
