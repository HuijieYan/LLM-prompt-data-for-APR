The buggy function is using the split() method on the command.script without checking if the script actually contains multiple words. This is causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split result.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains multiple words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This code first splits the command.script into words and then checks if there are more than one word and if the second word is 'stash'. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
