The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `command` as input and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at `command.script.split()[1]`, which means that `command.script` does not have a second word.

The issue is that the function assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two words, which is not the case. To fix this, we need to check if `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. This should fix the `IndexError` and make the function pass the failing test.
