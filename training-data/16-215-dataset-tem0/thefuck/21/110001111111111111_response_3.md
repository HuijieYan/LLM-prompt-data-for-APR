The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when the split result has fewer than two elements.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split result before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original code.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It will also successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
