1. The buggy function is a decorator function that takes in a command and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the decorator @git_support without defining the git_support function.

3. The bug's cause is that the decorator @git_support is not defined, so it is causing an error when trying to use it.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Define the git_support function to be used as a decorator.
   - Remove the @git_support decorator if it is not necessary for the match function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# Define the git_support function as a decorator
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add any necessary functionality for git support
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Use the git_support decorator for the match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
