Potential error location: The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may cause an error if the command script does not contain at least two words.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, it does not handle cases where the command script does not contain at least two words, leading to a potential IndexError. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the command script contains at least two words before accessing the second word.
2. Add error handling to handle cases where the command script does not contain at least two words.

Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
