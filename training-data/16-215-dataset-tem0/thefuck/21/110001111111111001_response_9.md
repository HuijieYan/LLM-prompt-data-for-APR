The buggy function is trying to split the command.script by spaces and then check if the second element is 'stash'. However, it does not handle the case where the script does not have a second element, which is causing the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
