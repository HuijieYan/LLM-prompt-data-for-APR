1. The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `match` function as an argument. The `match` function checks if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The failing test is checking if the `match` function returns False for a specific command.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line is trying to access the second element of the split command script, which may not exist if the command script is empty or does not contain any spaces.

3. The bug's cause is an `IndexError` because the `split()` method is being called on an empty string, resulting in an empty list, and then trying to access the second element of that empty list.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the command script is not empty before trying to split it.
   - Check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script and len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
