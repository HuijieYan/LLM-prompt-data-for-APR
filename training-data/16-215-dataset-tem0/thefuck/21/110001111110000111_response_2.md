The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` is occurring at line 8, which is when trying to access the second element of the split command script.

The failing test is trying to match a command with stderr containing the usage of `git stash`, but the function is failing to split the command script properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command script is split properly and then check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly split the command script and check for 'stash' as the second element, and 'usage:' in the command stderr. This should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function work as intended.

This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" as the corrected function will now properly handle commands where the script is just 'git'.
