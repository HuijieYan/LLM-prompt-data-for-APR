The buggy function is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined in the given code. This is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we can remove the decorator and directly define the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
