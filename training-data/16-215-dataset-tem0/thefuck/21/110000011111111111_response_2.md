The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` that takes a `command` as input and checks if the second word in `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 8, which is caused by `command.script.split()[1]` when `command.script` does not contain a second word.

The failing test provides the input parameters and the expected output, which is that the function should return `False`. However, the function is throwing an `IndexError` because it is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if it exists.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. We can also add a check to ensure that `command.stderr` is not empty before checking for 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code checks if `command.script` contains at least two words and then compares the second word to 'stash'. It also checks if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. This should fix the `IndexError` and make the function return the expected value for the failing test.
