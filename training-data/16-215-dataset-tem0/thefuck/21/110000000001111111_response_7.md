The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support` that is applied to the `match` function. The `match` function checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

The issue arises when the `command.script` is just 'git', as in this case, `command.script.split()[1]` will raise an `IndexError` since there is no second word in the string.

The GitHub issue title and description indicate that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just 'git', which aligns with the analysis of the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to handle the case when `command.script` is just 'git'. We can do this by first checking if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` when `command.script` is just 'git'.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
