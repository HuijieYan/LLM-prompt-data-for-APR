The buggy function is a part of the `git_push.py` file in the `thefuck` repository. The function is supposed to fix the command for `git push -u` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The issue on GitHub (#538) mentions that the suggestions for `git push -u` are broken after a certain merge (#538).

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying and removing these options, leading to incorrect suggestions.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. This is causing incorrect suggestions for `git push -u`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more robust method to identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command.
2. Ensure that the correct index is used to remove the options from the `command.script_parts`.
3. Verify that the correct push upstream value is being extracted from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
