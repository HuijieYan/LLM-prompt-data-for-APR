The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' argument with the value obtained from the command's stderr. However, the function is not correctly identifying the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command.script_parts list, and it is not correctly extracting the value for push_upstream from the command's stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command.script_parts list, and it is not correctly extracting the value for push_upstream from the command's stderr. This is leading to incorrect output values for push_upstream.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command.script_parts list, and then extract the value for push_upstream from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now correctly identify the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command.script_parts list, and extract the value for push_upstream from the command's stderr. It should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
