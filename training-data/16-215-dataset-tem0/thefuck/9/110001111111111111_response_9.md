The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list. The function is trying to remove the same index twice, which causes an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list only once, and then return the updated command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

The corrected function also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
