The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list, which results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test and error message, as well as the expected input/output variable information. The failing test is trying to execute the function with different inputs, and the error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised when trying to pop the same index twice. This aligns with the expected input/output variable information, where the `upstream_option_index` is expected to be `-1` in some cases, indicating that the index is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the index is not found. We can also simplify the logic for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now handle the cases where the index is not found and should pass the failing test. It also aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.

This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
