The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' command with the actual suggested command obtained from the stderr of the 'command' object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the 'command.script_parts' list. The current implementation is not correctly removing the option and its argument, leading to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the 'command.script_parts' list, leading to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' to correctly remove the option and its argument from the 'command.script_parts' list.
2. Ensure that the correct index is used to remove both the option and its argument, and handle cases where the argument might not be present.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the 'command.script_parts' list, and provide the expected suggestions for the git push command. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
