1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it is responsible for handling the git push -u command and removing the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments. The GitHub issue indicates that the suggestions for git push -u myfork are not being generated correctly, and instead, hub push --set-upstream is being suggested.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments, as well as the generation of the push_upstream variable.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments, and the push_upstream variable is not being generated accurately. This is evident from the GitHub issue where incorrect suggestions are being made for the git push -u command.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments is done correctly.
   - Checking the command.stderr for the correct information to generate the push_upstream variable.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments is done correctly, and the push_upstream variable is generated accurately. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
