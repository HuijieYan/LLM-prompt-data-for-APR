The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then replace the `push` argument with the actual branch name obtained from the stderr. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27, which is caused by trying to pop an element from an empty list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line, where it tries to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if the list is empty.

The bug's cause is that the `upstream_option_index` is being set to -1 initially, and then the code tries to pop an element at that index without checking if it's valid.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before trying to pop elements from the list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test.
