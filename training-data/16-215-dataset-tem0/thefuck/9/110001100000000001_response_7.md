Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is in the try-except blocks where it tries to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts. If the first try block finds the index, the second try block will still execute and potentially overwrite the index found by the first try block.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the upstream_option_index. The code should only update the index if it is not found in the first try block.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use if-else statements instead of two separate try-except blocks to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u'.
2. Use a single try-except block to find both '--set-upstream' and '-u' and then handle the index accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
