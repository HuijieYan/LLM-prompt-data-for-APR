The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to pop the same index twice, which results in an IndexError when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the second pop operation and also handle the case where the '-u' option is found, but its argument is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if the argument for -u is present
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
