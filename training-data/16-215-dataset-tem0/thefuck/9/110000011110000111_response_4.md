The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support` that takes a command as input and modifies it based on certain conditions. The failing test function `test_get_new_command` is testing the `get_new_command` function with different inputs and asserting the expected output. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 32 of the `get_new_command` function, specifically when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` at `upstream_option_index`.

The cause of the bug is that the code is trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` at an index that may not exist, leading to the `IndexError`. This is happening because the code is not checking if the index exists before trying to pop the element.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before popping the elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to update the `get_new_command` function to handle the different cases mentioned in the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
