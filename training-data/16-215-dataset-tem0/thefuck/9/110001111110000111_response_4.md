The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the value obtained from the `stderr` attribute of the `Command` object.

The error occurs when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 of the `git_push.py` file, which is caused by trying to pop an index that is out of range.

The failing test function `test_get_new_command` provides specific cases where the function should return a certain output based on the input `Command` object and its `stderr` attribute. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the expected output.

The GitHub issue titled "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin" and its detailed description provide an example of the incorrect output and the expected output. It also mentions that the issue was introduced by a specific merge (#538).

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified and then remove the correct elements from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the replacement of the `push` argument with the value obtained from the `stderr` attribute should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts)
    new_command = new_command.replace('push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```

With this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output. Additionally, it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
