The issue seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation only captures the last key=value pair, which is not the expected behavior. The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the form data and assigns values to the fields.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data, resulting in only the last key=value pair being captured.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are captured and validated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code should now correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
