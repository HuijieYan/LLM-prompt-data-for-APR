The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly. It only considers the last value for a key, which causes the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it handles the `received_body` and assigns the value to the `value` variable.

To fix the bug, the function needs to collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = [v.decode() if isinstance(v, bytes) else v for v in value]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data and assigns those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
