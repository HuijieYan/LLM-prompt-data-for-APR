The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body and validating them against the required parameters. The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are all failing with the error message `assert 422 == 200`. This indicates that the response status code is not as expected, which means the validation of the received data is not working as intended.

The GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" is related to the problem. It describes the issue where FastAPI does not collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the received body. The function is not correctly handling the case where the same key appears multiple times in the form data.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling repeated keys in the form data, leading to incorrect validation and response status codes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This will align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This should resolve the failing tests and also address the issue described in the GitHub post.
