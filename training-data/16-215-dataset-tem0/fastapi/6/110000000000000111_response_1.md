1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body into arguments for further processing. The function is designed to handle form data and extract values for the required parameters. The GitHub issue is related to the behavior of FastAPI when handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, where only the last key=value wins, and it does not work as expected when trying to validate against multiple values for the same key.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the extraction of values from the received body, especially when dealing with repeated keys in form data.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle repeated keys in form data properly, as it only extracts the last value for a key, which does not align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
   (b). The GitHub issue highlights the need for FastAPI to collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens, which is not currently supported by the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and collect all values for the same key into a list before validation.
   (b). Update the function to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, where it should support the validation of multiple values for the same key in form data.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                # Handle missing or empty values
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Validate the value and handle errors
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data by checking if the field alias exists in the received body and collecting all values for the same key into a list if the field shape requires it. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.
