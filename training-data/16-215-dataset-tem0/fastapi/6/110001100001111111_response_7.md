The issue seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation only captures the last key=value pair, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it processes the received_body and assigns values to the corresponding keys.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data. It should be collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code should now properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
