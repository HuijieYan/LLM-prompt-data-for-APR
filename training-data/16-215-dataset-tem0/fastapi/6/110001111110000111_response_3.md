1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments. The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are testing the behavior of the function when receiving form data with repeated keys. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200.

The GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" is related to the problem, suggesting that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of repeated keys in the form data.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data, leading to validation errors and incorrect responses.
   (b). The related functions are not properly processing repeated keys in the form data, leading to validation issues.
   (c). The failing test and error message indicate that the response status code is incorrect, and the response data does not match the expected values due to the mishandling of repeated keys in the form data.
   (d). The GitHub issue information suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data, ensuring that they are collected and assigned as a list to the same key before validation.
   (b). Update the related functions to process repeated keys in the form data appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.required and value is None:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the `request_body_to_args` function will now correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and assign them as a list to the same key before validation. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
