The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the handling of non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when received as form data. The function is not correctly handling these cases, leading to incorrect values and errors being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking for non-typing sequences and is not handling them appropriately when received as form data. This results in the function returning incorrect values and errors, causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle non-typing sequences when received as form data. It should check for the type of the field and handle lists, sets, and tuples accordingly. Additionally, it should generate the correct errors when the received data does not match the expected type.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if field.type_ == list:
                    value = list(value)
                elif field.type_ == set:
                    value = set(value)
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = tuple(value)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle non-typing sequences when received as form data and generate the correct errors when the received data does not match the expected type. This should make the function pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
