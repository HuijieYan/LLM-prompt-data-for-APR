The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the handling of different field types and shapes. The function is not correctly handling the case when the received body is a FormData and the field type is list, set, or tuple.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `received_body` when the field type is list, set, or tuple. The function is not properly extracting the values from the FormData and is not handling the different field types and shapes correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the extraction of values from the FormData based on the field type and shape. Additionally, it needs to properly handle the validation and error reporting for different field types and shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        elif field.shape == 2:
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                        elif field.shape == 3:
                            value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code should handle the extraction of values from the FormData based on the field type and shape, and properly handle the validation and error reporting for different field types and shapes. It should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
