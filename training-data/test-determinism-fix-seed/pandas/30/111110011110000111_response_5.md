The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is located within the `Parser` class. The failing test is trying to read a JSON string of boolean values as a series using the `read_json` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly. It is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime instead of returning them as a series of boolean values.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should be modified to handle boolean values separately and return a series of boolean values as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif data.dtype == bool:
            return pd.Series(data), False
        else:
            return data, False
```

This corrected function handles boolean values separately and returns a series of boolean values if the input `data` is of boolean type. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue.
