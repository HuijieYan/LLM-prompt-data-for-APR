The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the Parser class in the `_json.py` file of the pandas library. This function is intended to parse a ndarray like into a date column. However, the function has multiple issues, causing it to return unexpected results.

The main issue in the function is that it incorrectly handles the conversion of boolean data to date values. This is evident in Case 2, where the input data is a series of boolean values, but the function attempts to convert it to date values, which is not the expected behavior.

The GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" provides a clear description of the problem. The expected behavior of the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` should be to return a Pandas Series of boolean values, but instead, it is currently raising a TypeError or returning a Series of timestamps.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle boolean data differently and ensure that it returns the expected output in all cases.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check for boolean data and handle it separately, returning a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to date values. Additionally, the function should handle other data types such as integers and floats as per the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    # Check if the data is boolean, return the original data if it is
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, True

    # Original code to handle other data types
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        # ... (remaining code same as before)

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check for boolean data and returns the original data with a boolean flag if the input data is a Pandas Series of boolean values. Additionally, it retains the original functionality for handling other data types and attempting to convert them to date values.

By making these changes, the function should now return the expected output in all cases and address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
