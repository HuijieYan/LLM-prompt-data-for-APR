The bug in the code is causing unexpected behavior when trying to parse a date column from a pandas Series. The issue is related to the way the function is converting the input data to a date column.

The problem seems to be originating from the way the function is handling the input data and its conversion to date format. It appears that the function is incorrectly converting boolean data to timestamps, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle boolean data appropriately and ensure that it does not attempt to convert it to timestamps. The function should also handle the input data types correctly and return a Series of the expected data type.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        if is_bool_dtype(new_data):
            return new_data, False
        else:
            return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

By using pandas' to_datetime function and checking if the input data is of boolean type, we can ensure that the function handles boolean data correctly and returns a Series of the expected data type.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
