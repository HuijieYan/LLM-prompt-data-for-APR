1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is part of the class Parser in the file pandas/io/json/_json.py. This function is responsible for parsing a data array into a date column by coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic around converting data into int64 and checking if the data is within range.

3. The bug is likely caused by the conversion of data into int64 and the handling of data that is out of range. The logic for checking if the data is within range and coercing it into int64 may not be working as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for converting data into int64 and handling out of range data.
   - Adding proper error handling and logging to identify the specific issues with the data conversion and range checking.
   - Updating the logic to correctly handle different data formats and ranges.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the variable `new_data` is properly used for all references. Additionally, the `astype` method now operates on the `new_data` array and checks for type conversion errors. The comparison for in_range also uses the `new_data` array. Overall, the corrected code addresses the potential issues in the original buggy function.
