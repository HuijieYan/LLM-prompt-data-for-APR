The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. This function is intended to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column in a Pandas dataframe. However, it has multiple issues that lead to incorrect behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

After analyzing the problematic function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the potential error location is in the logic related to date conversion and checking for the range of values.

The cause of the bug is related to incorrect handling of data types and incorrect conditions for checking the range of values. This leads to the function wrongly converting boolean data into date data, resulting in an exception.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle boolean data correctly and to avoid the erroneous conversion of boolean data into date data. This can be achieved by adding specific checks for boolean data types and updating the logic related to the range of values.

With these considerations in mind, below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False

        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(data) | (data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

The above corrected code introduces checks for boolean data types and updates the logic for checking the range of values. This ensures that the function correctly handles boolean data and avoids the erroneous conversion of boolean data into date data.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
