1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for converting data to date format, which is causing the bug when used with the `read_json` function in certain scenarios.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks for the dtype of the data and attempts to convert it to int64 if it is of type "object".

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect conversion of data to date format within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. This is resulting in the unexpected behavior when using the `read_json` function with `typ="series"`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the data type more accurately and handling the conversion appropriately.
   - Ensuring that the function returns the expected output based on the input data type and format.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_try_convert_to_date`:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # make a copy to avoid modifying the original data
    
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')
            return new_data, True
        except ValueError:
            return data, False

    return data, False  # return the original data if no conversion was successful
```

This corrected code handles the data type conversion using `pd.to_datetime` for objects and returns the correct output based on the conversion result. It will help resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
