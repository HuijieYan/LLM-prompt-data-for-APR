The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse a data input into a date column, but it's not working as expected and is leading to a TypeError in certain cases. The issue is related to the handling of boolean values. Based on the failing test and error message, it's clear that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is incorrect.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the function incorrectly trying to convert boolean values to datetime. This results in a TypeError due to the inability to convert boolean values to datetime.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle boolean values differently and return the expected output. This could involve checking the data type and returning the original data in case of boolean input, thus preventing the attempt to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
