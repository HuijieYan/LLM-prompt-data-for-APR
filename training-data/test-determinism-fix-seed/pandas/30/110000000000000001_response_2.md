1. The buggy function is designed to parse an ndarray into a date column. However, there are potential errors in the code that may prevent the function from working correctly.

2. The potential error location in the code could be within the try-except block that attempts to convert the data to int64 if its dtype is "object".

3. The cause of the bug could be:
   (a) The function is not handling the conversion of data to int64 properly leading to potential errors.
   (b) The check for numbers that are out of range may not be functioning as intended.
   (c) The error handling for the to_datetime function may not be catching all possible exceptions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Properly handle the conversion of data to int64 and handle any potential errors.
   (b) Improve the check for numbers that are out of range.
   (c) Ensure that the error handling for the to_datetime function is comprehensive.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Fixed the variable name and the conversion
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)  # Modified the condition
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False  # Fixed the return value

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True  # Moved the return statement inside the loop
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return new_data, False
```
In the corrected code, the variable `new_data` is properly used and the conditions for checking numbers out of range have been modified. The return statement has also been moved inside the loop to ensure that it returns correctly if parsing is successful.
