1. The buggy function appears to be designed to convert a given array into a date column, handling different data types and formats. However, there are some issues in the conversion logic.

2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of date conversions and the condition checks for valid date ranges.

3. The bug's cause appears to be related to incorrect handling of date conversions and the conditions for identifying valid date ranges.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Properly checking for the dtype of the input data and then converting it to the desired date format.
   - Handling the date ranges and conditions for valid dates more accurately.
   - Ensuring that the conversion is done consistently for different input types and formats.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False
```
In the corrected code, the handling of the dtype and conversion to int64 for object types is fixed, as well as the conditions for valid date ranges. Also, the return statements are modified to return the correct data.
