The issue identified in the buggy function is that it is trying to convert boolean values to dates, which is resulting in unexpected behavior. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, where the user is expecting a Series of boolean values but is getting unexpected output. 

The potential error location within the function is that it attempts to convert data to date format without considering the data type. 

The bug's cause is related to the fact that the function is trying to coerce boolean values into a date format, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies with user expectations.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for the data type before attempting to convert it to date format. If the data type is boolean, the function should return the original data without attempting to convert it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # check if data type is boolean
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # continue with the conversion for other data types
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code will check for the data type before attempting any conversion. If the data type is boolean, it will return the original data without any conversion, thus addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post.
