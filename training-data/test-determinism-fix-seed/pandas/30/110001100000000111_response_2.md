1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. The function attempts to coerce objects in epoch/ISO formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. The issue on GitHub describes how the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps/exceptions instead of a Series of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of data when its dtype is "object". If the dtype is not being correctly identified as "bool", it may be incorrectly converted to a date using the `to_datetime` function.

3. (a). The buggy function attempts to convert data into date format and returns a boolean if parsing was successful. It checks for the dtype of the data, and if it's "object", it attempts to convert it to "int64". Then it checks for values that are out of range and converts the data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.
   (b). The related function, `read_json`, is responsible for parsing JSON files into a pandas DataFrame or Series. The issue on GitHub is related to the incorrect behavior when using `read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools.
   (c). The GitHub issue information states that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it results in timestamps or raises an exception.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check for "bool" dtype in addition to "object" dtype and handling it separately to prevent incorrect conversion.
   - Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the data type before attempting any conversions.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # Check if it's boolean type
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, True
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
``` 

The corrected code now includes a check for "bool" dtype and early returns with the data and `True` if the dtype is "bool", effectively handling the conversion of bool values separately from other data types.
