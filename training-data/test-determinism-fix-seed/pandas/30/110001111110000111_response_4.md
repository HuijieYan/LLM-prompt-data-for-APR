The problematic function is _try_convert_to_date, which is a method of a class located in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file. This function is related to the read_json function and is used to convert data to a date column.

The failing test function test_readjson_bool_series is trying to read a JSON string containing boolean values as a series using the read_json function. The error message indicates that a TypeError is raised when trying to convert a boolean type to datetime.

The GitHub issue title and description provide additional context, explaining that the read_json function with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools results in a TypeError, while older versions of Pandas used to convert the list to timestamps.

The code that specifically raises the TypeError is the line new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit) within the _try_convert_to_date function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not the expected behavior when reading a JSON list of bools as a series.

To fix the bug, the _try_convert_to_date function should first check the data type and return the original data without attempting to convert boolean values to datetime. It should only convert if the data type is not a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly handle the conversion of data to a date column and will pass the failing test case provided. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
