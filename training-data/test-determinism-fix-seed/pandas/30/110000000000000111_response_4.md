1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue because it is attempting to parse a JSON array of boolean values into a Pandas Series, but instead of generating a Series of boolean values, it is producing a Series of timestamps or raising an exception.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that attempts to coerce the input data into a date format. The function is not correctly handling boolean values and is erroneously converting them into timestamps.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` does not handle boolean values properly, leading to incorrect conversion and an unexpected output of timestamps or an exception when trying to parse a JSON array of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to handle boolean values separately and directly convert them to a Pandas Series of boolean values.
   - Ensuring that the function correctly identifies and handles different data types, including boolean values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.errors import OutOfBoundsDatetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == bool:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, OutOfBoundsDatetime):
            return data, False
    else:
        return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

The corrected function includes additional handling for boolean values and uses the `pd.to_datetime` function to ensure that boolean values are not mistakenly converted into timestamps. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post and produce the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values.
