1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to parse a ndarray into a date column, but it seems to be converting boolean values to timestamps instead of returning a series of boolean values as expected in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the section where it checks if the data type is "object" and tries to convert it to "int64".

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the input data as boolean values and is instead attempting to convert them to timestamps. This behavior is not consistent with the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to check if the data type is boolean, and if so, returning the original data as a Pandas Series of boolean values without attempting any conversion.
   - Handling boolean values separately from other data types to ensure they are not mistakenly converted to timestamps.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, True
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        new_data = data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors="coerce")
        new_data.fillna(data, inplace=True)
    else:
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data) 
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle boolean values and return a Pandas Series of boolean values as expected in the GitHub issue. The additional check for boolean values ensures that they are not mistakenly converted to timestamps.
