1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class, which is responsible for parsing a ndarray into a date column. The function tries to convert the input data to a date format and returns a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful. The function seems to be encountering issues with boolean values and returning timestamps instead of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the conversion process when the input data is of boolean type.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert the input data into a different data type to parse as dates, leading to unexpected behavior with boolean values.
   (b). The `Parser` class is not handling boolean values appropriately, resulting in the conversion error.
   (c). The related functions in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file might be contributing to the incorrect handling of boolean values.
   (d). The GitHub issue information indicates that `read_json` with `typ="series"` of json list of bools results in timestamps or an exception. The expected output is a Pandas Series of bools, which is not being produced due to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly handle boolean values and return a Pandas Series of bools when appropriate.
   (b). Make necessary adjustments in the `Parser` class to accommodate boolean values during the conversion process.
   (c). Check and modify related functions in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file to ensure they handle boolean values correctly.
   (d). Test the fix with the provided code sample to verify that the issue has been resolved.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.errors import UnsupportedFunctionCall
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if is_integer(data.dtype) or data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        raise UnsupportedFunctionCall("_try_convert_to_date")
``` 

With these changes, the function checks for boolean values and returns the data as is with a False boolean, and also correctly handles the date conversion using `pd.to_datetime` with "coerce" as the error handling. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
