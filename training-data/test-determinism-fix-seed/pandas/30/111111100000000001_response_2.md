1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It attempts to parse a ndarray like into a date column by coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. The potential error location within the function could be in the handling of data types and the conversion to date.

2. The potential error in the function could be related to the handling of data types and the conversion to date. The function seems to have issues in validating the data and handling different date units.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The function initially checks for the length of the data, but the logic for data conversion and validation is not implemented correctly. It attempts to coerce the data into int64, but there's no proper handling for different data types and date units.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Validate the data type and format before attempting to convert to date.
   - Implement proper error handling for different data types and date units.
   - Use appropriate methods for date conversion based on the data type and format.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the data type validation and conversion are handled properly, and errors are caught and handled at specific locations. Additionally, the loop for different date units now returns the converted data and sets the flag to True if successful.
