1. The buggy function is responsible for converting data to date formats, but it has some issues when handling boolean values, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The issue states that when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a json list of bools, it results in timestamps or an exception, whereas the expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function tries to convert boolean values to date formats.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly, leading to the unexpected output of timestamps or an exception when the input data is a Pandas Series of bools.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding a specific condition to handle boolean values separately before attempting to convert them to date formats.
   - Modifying the function to check the data type and handle boolean values differently from other data types.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False  # return the data as is and indicate parsing was not successful

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a specific condition to handle boolean values separately and return the data as is while indicating that parsing was not successful. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub.
