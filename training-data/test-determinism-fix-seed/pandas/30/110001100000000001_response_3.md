1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into a date column using various methods. It checks if the data is of object type and attempts to convert it to `int64`. It also checks for numbers that are out of range and ignores them. Then it attempts to convert the data to datetime for specific date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conversion of data to `int64` and the handling of numbers that are out of range.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the improper handling and conversion of the data, as well as the handling of numbers that are out of range within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Properly handle the conversion of data to `int64`, perhaps using a different method or checking for specific data formats before conversion.
   b. Improve the logic for handling numbers that are out of range.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.missing import isna, iNaT
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- We have replaced `data.astype("int64")` with `pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')` to properly handle the conversion to numeric values without raising errors.
- We have kept the logic for handling out of range numbers unchanged as it seems appropriate.
