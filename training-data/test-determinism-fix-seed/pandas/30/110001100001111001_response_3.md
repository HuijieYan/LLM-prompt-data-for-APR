The issue with the function is that it is not properly converting the data to a date format and is not handling different data types properly.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:
1. Check the data type and convert it to int64 if it is an object.
2. Handle the date conversion and check for errors properly.
3. Return the correct data and a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # convert to timestamp
    new_data = new_data.to_series()
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle different data types and perform the date conversion as expected.
