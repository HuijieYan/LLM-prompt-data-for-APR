The problem in the provided function is that it incorrectly processes the input data and performs unnecessary conversions, leading to an incorrect output. The function is intended to handle date conversion but is incorrectly converting boolean input to timestamps.

The GitHub issue title provides a clear indication that the problem occurs when using the `read_json` function with `typ="series"`, resulting in the incorrect interpretation of boolean values as timestamps.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it attempts to convert data to the int64 data type and then to a datetime object. This is causing incorrect handling of boolean input, leading to the issue described in the GitHub post.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of boolean data within the function, leading to incorrect conversions and unexpected output. This bug is consistent with the symptoms described in the GitHub issue, where boolean values are incorrectly converted to timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle boolean input and avoid unnecessary conversions. Specifically, boolean input should not be processed as if it were date data.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # Handle boolean data separately
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        new_data = data

    # Perform date conversion as before
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle boolean input separately and avoid unnecessary conversions. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and produce the expected output.
