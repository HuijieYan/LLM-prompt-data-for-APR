The issue stems from the `_try_convert_to_date` function trying to convert boolean values into date values, resulting in unexpected behavior. In addition, the function contains several errors that contribute to the unexpected behavior. The function incorrectly handles the `data` input, causing it to be treated as dates when it should not be. The actual return value of the function is also incorrect, as it should return a Series with boolean values. The GitHub issue describes the unexpected behavior caused by this bug, and also highlights the discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` needs to be modified to correctly handle boolean data and return the expected output. It needs to check the type of the input data and return a boolean Series without trying to convert the data into dates. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to convert a boolean series into a date column.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

This corrected code will correctly handle boolean data and return a boolean Series without trying to convert the data into dates, as expected.
