The buggy function is intended to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column, coercing objects to epoch/iso formats and integers/floats to epoch formats. It then returns a boolean if parsing was successful. However, the fix is needed as it is currently not returning the expected results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional logic that checks for the dtype of the input data and attempts to convert it to int64.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the input data and its dtype, leading to unexpected behavior when converting the input to a date column.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to appropriately handle the input data based on its dtype. If the dtype is "object", we can attempt to coerce it to int64. Then, we can check for numbers that are out of range and ignore them. Finally, we should attempt to convert the data to datetime using the specified date unit and handle any exceptions that may occur.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray
from pandas.errors import OutOfBoundsDatetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            new_data > self.min_stamp
        )
        new_data = new_data[in_range]
        if len(new_data) == 0:
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
        if isinstance(new_data, DatetimeArray):
            return new_data, True
        else:
            raise OutOfBoundsDatetime
    except (ValueError, OverflowError, OutOfBoundsDatetime):
        return data, False
```

This corrected function should now correctly parse the input data into a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful. This fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
