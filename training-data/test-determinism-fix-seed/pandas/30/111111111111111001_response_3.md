The bug occurs due to a mismatch in the type of the `new_data` variable and the operation `to_datetime` that is being performed on it. The `new_data` variable should be of a type that is convertible to a datetime, and in the failing test case, it is a boolean type which is not convertible to datetime, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the code should first check the type of the data being passed and perform the necessary conversion before attempting to convert it to datetime. In the failing test case, the data is of type Series with boolean values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle the case where `new_data` is of boolean type and return early instead of attempting to convert it to datetime. This will ensure that boolean values are not processed by the conversion logic, preventing the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will early return with `False` if the `new_data` is of boolean type, effectively preventing it from being processed by the `to_datetime` function. This will fix the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test case.
