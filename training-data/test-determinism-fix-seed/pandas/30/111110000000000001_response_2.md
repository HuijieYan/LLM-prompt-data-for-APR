1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class and is designed to convert a given input data into a date column. The function attempts to handle different data types and formats to parse into a date.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the new_data variable and the conversion of data types.

3. The potential bug in the function could be due to the improper handling of data type conversions, as well as potential issues with the conditions for returning the data and a boolean value. The class itself may not properly handle the date_unit and the min_stamp attributes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include adjusting the data type conversions, improving error handling, and ensuring that the class attributes are properly utilized within the function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # This is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, adjustments have been made to the conditional statements and the handling of the new_data variable to ensure proper data type conversions and error handling. Additionally, the utilization of class attributes such as date_unit and min_stamp has been refined within the function.
