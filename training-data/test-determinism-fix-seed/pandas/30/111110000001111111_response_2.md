The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the parsing of boolean values as dates. This is causing the function to return erroneous outputs, as specified in the failing tests, and also leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of boolean values to dates when the input data contains boolean values. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect outputs.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of boolean values within the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output variable values. This behavior is also consistent with the issue reported on GitHub, where parsing a JSON array of boolean values is resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle boolean values differently from date values. It should check for the presence of boolean values and handle them appropriately, rather than attempting to convert them to dates.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This updated code has a new condition that specifically handles boolean values and returns `data, False` if such values are encountered. This should prevent the function from incorrectly attempting to convert boolean values to dates and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
