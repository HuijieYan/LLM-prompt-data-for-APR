1. The buggy function is _try_convert_to_date, which is a method of the Parser class. This function tries to convert input data into a date column by parsing it. The failing test is test_readjson_bool_series, which is trying to read a JSON input "[true, true, false]" as a series. The error message shows that the TypeError "class 'bool' is not convertible to datetime" is raised when trying to convert the boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where it tries to convert the data to datetime using the to_datetime function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function _try_convert_to_date is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion. This is evident from the failing test that tries to read boolean values as a series and results in a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding a condition to check the data type before trying to convert it to datetime.
   - If the data type is boolean, return the data as is without attempting to convert it.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True

        return data, False
```

This corrected function now includes a condition to check if the data type is boolean, in which case it returns the data as is. This should fix the bug and ensure that boolean values are not attempted to be converted to datetime. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
