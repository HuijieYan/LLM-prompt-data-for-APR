1. The problematic function `_try_convert_to_date` is found within the `Parser` class in the file pandas/io/json/_json.py. This function is responsible for converting a given data into a date column, handling various data types and formats. The failing test is located in the test_pandas.py file, and it pertains to reading a JSON object with boolean values and converting it to a series. The error message indicates that a boolean type is not convertible to datetime.

2. The potential error in the problematic function `_try_convert_to_date` is likely related to the conversion of boolean values to datetime. This is indicated by the TypeError in the error message, where a boolean type is being processed as if it were a datetime.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` does not handle boolean values as input data properly, leading to a TypeError during conversion. The related class, Parser, is responsible for parsing and converting data, which includes the function `_try_convert_to_date`. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is attempting to read a JSON object with boolean values and convert it to a series, triggering the error message that indicates a boolean type is not convertible to datetime.

4. To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean values as input data and appropriately exclude them from the date conversion process, as they are not convertible to datetime.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_try_convert_to_date`:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        # handle boolean values
        return data, False
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code handles boolean values appropriately and excludes them from the date conversion process, resolving the TypeError when attempting to convert boolean to datetime. This updated code should now pass the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`.
