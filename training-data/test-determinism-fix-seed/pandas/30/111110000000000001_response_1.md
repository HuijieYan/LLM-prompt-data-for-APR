1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class. It is intended to convert data into a date format, handling different cases such as object types and numeric types. However, there are several potential issues with the implementation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of data using `astype("int64")`.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the following:
   (a) The function attempts to handle different data types and formats, but the conversion of data to "int64" may not always be appropriate.
   (b) The class itself may not have properly initialized attributes that are being used in the function, such as `date_unit` and `min_stamp`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Implementing more robust error handling and validation for different data types and formats.
   (b) Ensuring that the class attributes used in the function are properly initialized and available for use.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, Timestamp, iNaT

class Parser():

    def __init__(self, min_stamp, date_unit, _STAMP_UNITS):
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self._STAMP_UNITS = _STAMP_UNITS

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        else:
            new_data = data

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- The `__init__` method is added to properly initialize the class attributes.
- The logic for handling different data types and formats is revised to ensure that the conversion to "int64" is only attempted for object types.
- Proper error handling and validation are included to address potential issues with different data types and formats.
