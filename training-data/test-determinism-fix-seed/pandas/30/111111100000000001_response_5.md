Analysis of the buggy function:
The _try_convert_to_date function is part of the Parser class and is responsible for attempting to parse a ndarray into a date column. It checks for different data types and attempts to convert them into date formats. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including the handling of empty data, coercion of object types, checking for numbers out of range, and converting data to datetime.

The potential error locations within the function are:
- The handling of empty data: The function returns the data without performing any conversion if it is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Coercion of object types: The function attempts to coerce object types into int64 without checking for valid date formats, leading to potential errors.
- Checking for numbers out of range: The function uses issubclass and isna functions without importing the necessary libraries, which will result in errors.
- Converting data to datetime: The function attempts to convert the data to datetime without properly handling exceptions and error cases, leading to potential bugs.

Bug's cause:
The potential causes of the bug within the function are:
- Mishandling of empty data
- Improper coercion of object types
- Errors in checking for numbers out of range
- Inadequate handling of exceptions during datetime conversion

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle empty data and return a boolean indicating success or failure.
2. Implement a more robust coercion of object types into valid date formats.
3. Import the necessary libraries for issubclass and isna functions to check for numbers out of range.
4. Implement proper exception handling during datetime conversion.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime
