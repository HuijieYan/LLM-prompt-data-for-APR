The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the class `Parser` which exists in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. This function is responsible for attempting to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it checks for the data type and attempts to convert it to `int64` if the data type is "object". There could be issues in handling different data types and formats at this point.

The bug's cause may be due to the mishandling of data types and formats within the function, potentially leading to errors when trying to convert the data to date.

To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
- Checking the data type and format conversion more thoroughly, ensuring that it covers a wider range of possibilities.
- Implementing proper error handling for different data types and formats, avoiding potential issues that could arise during the conversion process.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Parser():
    # The corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
