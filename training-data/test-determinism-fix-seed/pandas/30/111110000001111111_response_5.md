The issue seems to be with the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `Parser` class. The function is intended to parse a given input into a date column, but it seems to be converting boolean values to timestamps instead of returning a Series of boolean values.

The potential error location within the function seems to be the handling of boolean values, as it is trying to convert them to timestamps instead of returning them as they are.

The cause of the bug is likely in the section of the code where it handles boolean values. It should be checking for boolean values and not attempting to convert them to timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle boolean values by checking their type and returning them as they are, without attempting to convert them to timestamps.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    min_stamp = 31536000
    _STAMP_UNITS = ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')
    date_unit = 'ns'

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True  # return boolean values as they are

        in_range = (
            pd.isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        try:
            data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected code should handle boolean values properly and return them as they are, without attempting to convert them to timestamps. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
