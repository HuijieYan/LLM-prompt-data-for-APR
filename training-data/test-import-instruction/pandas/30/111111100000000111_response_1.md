1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. The GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" addresses a problem where using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` results in a Pandas Series of timestamps instead of boolean values. This problem was caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function trying to convert boolean values to timestamps.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of boolean values to timestamps.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:

   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for converting data into date formats.
   (b). The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which is used when parsing data from JSON files.
   (c). The related functions involved in the issue are the `to_datetime` function, which is used to convert data to datetime format, and the `read_json` function, which is affected by the bug.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides information about the expected output, the problem description, and the expected output of `pd.show_versions()`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values differently and not attempt to convert them to timestamps.
   - Implement a check in the `read_json` function to ensure that boolean values are not converted to timestamps when `typ="series"`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if not all(isinstance(val, bool) for val in data):  # check for boolean values
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        else:  # skip conversion for boolean values
            return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code includes a check for boolean values and a skip conversion for them, preventing them from being converted to timestamps. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
