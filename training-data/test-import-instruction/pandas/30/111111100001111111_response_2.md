The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` inside the `Parser` class, which is responsible for attempting to parse a column of data into a date column. The function tries to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, and then attempts to convert the data to datetime using various date units.

The bug seems to be in the way the function is handling the dtype of the data. It incorrectly assumes that if the dtype is "object", it can simply try to convert it to "int64", which is not the correct approach. 

In Case 1, the function incorrectly tries to change the dtype of `RangeIndex` to `int64`, which is unnecessary and causes the function to return incorrect values.

In Case 2, the function correctly identifies the dtype of the input data as "bool", but then treats it as a date unit instead of a boolean.

Considering the GitHub issue, it seems that the root cause of the problem is that the function is misinterpreting the data type and mishandling the conversion to date.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the data type is already a boolean, and if so, return the data as it is, without attempting to convert it to a date. Additionally, the function should handle boolean data correctly and return a Series of boolean values.

Corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the data type is boolean and returns it as is. It also correctly handles numeric data and attempts to convert it to datetime if necessary.

This corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
