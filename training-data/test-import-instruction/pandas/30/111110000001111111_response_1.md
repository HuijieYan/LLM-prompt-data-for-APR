The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` has several issues that are causing the failing tests. Let's analyze the function and its relationship with the class and the provided GitHub issue:

1. The function takes a data input and tries to convert it to a date column. It does so by first checking if the data is empty, then coercing object types to `int64`, and finally trying to convert the data to datetime with different units.
2. The class containing the function is not provided, but it seems to rely on attributes like `self.min_stamp` and `self.date_unit` which are not initialized within the function, and are expected to be set by the class. This suggests there might be issues with how the class sets these attributes.
3. The function seems to be trying to convert boolean data to datetime, which is likely causing the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue. The discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output indicates that the boolean data is being incorrectly processed by the function.

The potential error location within the function is the check for object type and the subsequent coercion to `int64`. The function should handle boolean data differently in order to return the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the data is boolean, and if so, handle it appropriately without attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False

        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True

        return data, False
```

This corrected function checks for boolean data and returns it immediately without attempting to convert it to datetime. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
