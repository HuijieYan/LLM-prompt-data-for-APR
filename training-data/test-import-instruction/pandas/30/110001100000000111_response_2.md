1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray into a date column. It attempts to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The issue is related to the conversion of boolean values to datetime values, which is unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the check for `new_data.dtype == "object"` as this triggers the attempt to convert the data to `int64`, leading to unexpected behavior when dealing with boolean values.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the handling of boolean values within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The function attempts to convert boolean values to datetime values, which is not the expected behavior. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, where the user expects a Series of bools, but instead gets datetime values or exceptions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to check for boolean data and handling it appropriately, possibly by returning the original data as a Series of bools.
   - Modifying the logic to handle different data types separately and not attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    # convert object to int64
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a separate check for boolean data, returning the original data as a Series of bools if the data is of boolean type. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
