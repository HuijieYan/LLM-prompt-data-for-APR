1. The buggy function is trying to convert a data array into a date column. It first checks if the data array is empty, and then attempts to coerce the data into integer format. It also checks if the numbers in the data array are within a certain range and ignores those that are out of range. Finally, it tries to convert the data into date format using different date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conversion of data into integer format and the handling of out of range numbers.

3. The bug's cause could be that the function is not properly handling the conversion of data into integer format and the check for numbers that are out of range. This could lead to incorrect results when trying to convert the data into date format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to:
   - Ensure that the conversion of data into integer format is done correctly and handle any errors that may occur during the conversion.
   - Improve the check for numbers that are out of range to accurately identify and ignore them.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
