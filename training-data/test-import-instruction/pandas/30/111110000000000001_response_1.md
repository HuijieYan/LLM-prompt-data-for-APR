1. The buggy function is named "_try_convert_to_date" and it is a method of the "Parser" class. This function tries to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of new_data dtype as "object" and the loop for trying to convert new_data to date using different date units.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of data to date. The handling of new_data dtype as "object" and the loop for trying different date units are not properly structured, leading to incorrect parsing of the date.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   a. Properly handle the conversion of data to date by checking for different date formats and using appropriate conversion methods.
   b. Ensure that the loop for trying different date units is correctly structured and handles exceptions properly.

5. Here is the corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser:
    # the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            if not (pd.isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == pd.Timestamp.max)).all():
                return data, False

        date_units = [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else ['ns']
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', format=None, unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `pd.to_datetime` method to properly handle the conversion of data to date. We have also modified the loop for trying different date units to ensure it handles exceptions properly and returns the correct result.
