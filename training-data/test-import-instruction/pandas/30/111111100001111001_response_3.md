The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `new_data` variable and the logic to check if the numbers are out of range. It seems that the dtype of `new_data` is being incorrectly assigned to `int64`, even when it is of type `RangeIndex`. This is causing the subsequent checks to fail and leading to incorrect results.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect assignment of `new_data` inside the function, and the incorrect assumptions about the type of data being handled.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the conversion of data to date, considering the types involved and checking for out-of-range values. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # other methods of the Parser class remain unchanged

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the `new_data` variable is correctly assigned the result of `astype("int64")` only when its dtype is "object", and the subsequent in-range check is properly conducted. This should address the issues found in the failing test cases. The corrected code also handles the date conversions appropriately based on the date units provided.

With these changes, the `Parser._try_convert_to_date` function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
