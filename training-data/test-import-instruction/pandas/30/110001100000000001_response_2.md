1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a function within the pandas repository that attempts to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. It tries to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. The function also checks for numbers that are out of range and handles date units and conversion to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the date units and the conversion to datetime.

3. The bug's cause could be that the function is not correctly handling the conversion to datetime for the provided date units. It may also not be properly handling the input data for conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
    - Checking the date unit and converting the input data accordingly.
    - Ensuring that the correct exceptions are handled during the conversion process.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the potential bug has been addressed by ensuring that the correct input data type and date unit are used for conversion to datetime. Additionally, the correct exceptions are handled during the conversion process.
