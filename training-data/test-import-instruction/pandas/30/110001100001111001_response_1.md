The bug in the given function seems to be the incorrect assignment of the new_data variable. In both cases, the new_data variable is assigned the original data without any conversion or manipulation, which results in the return of the original data instead of the expected transformed data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the new_data variable is properly converted and manipulated based on the conditions provided in the function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to explicitly check the dtype of the input data and perform the necessary conversion based on the dtype. Additionally, the range check should be applied to the original data before any conversion to ensure that the correct data is returned.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the new_data variable is correctly assigned the converted data, and the range check is applied to the original data before any conversion. This should resolve the issues with the buggy function and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
