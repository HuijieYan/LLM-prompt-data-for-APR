The buggy function _try_convert_to_date seems to be a method of the Parser class in the _json.py file of the pandas repository. This function is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column, handling different data types and date units.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the if statement checking for the data type, as well as the for loop iterating over date units. There might be issues with the data type conversion and the date parsing logic within the function.

The bug's cause could be related to incorrect data type handling and date parsing logic. The function first checks if the data type is "object" and tries to convert it to "int64". Then, it checks for numbers that are out of range and iterates over date units to parse the data. There might be issues with the data type conversion and date parsing logic that could lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can consider the following approaches:
1. Check the data type conversion logic and ensure that it properly handles different data types.
2. Review the date parsing logic and ensure that it correctly handles different date units and formats.
3. Add appropriate error handling and return statements to ensure that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use pd.to_datetime to handle the conversion to datetime, which simplifies the logic and ensures proper handling of different data types and date formats.
2. We use "coerce" as the errors parameter to handle any errors by returning NaT for invalid parsing.
3. We properly handle exceptions and return statements within the for loop to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
