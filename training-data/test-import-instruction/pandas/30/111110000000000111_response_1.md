1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method within the Parser class which attempts to parse a numpy array into a date column. The GitHub issue relates to the `read_json` method in pandas where the `typ="series"` argument results in unexpected behavior, specifically converting boolean values into timestamps. This behavior was flagged as a bug.

2. The potential error location within the `_try_convert_to_date` function appears to be the logic that checks for the data type and attempts conversion. The issue may lie in the handling of boolean data within this logic, leading to unexpected conversion to timestamps.

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert object data into int64 type and then into timestamps. This might be causing the conversion of boolean data into timestamps as well.
   (b). The Parser class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` function and is a part of the pandas repository.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem faced by the user, where boolean values are being converted into timestamps when using the `read_json` method with `typ="series"`. This inconsistency was reported as a bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve:
   (a). Reviewing the logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to ensure that boolean data is not being inadvertently converted into timestamps.
   (b). Checking the handling of boolean data and adding appropriate conditions to prevent such data from being processed as timestamps.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas import to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Added condition for boolean data
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
The corrected code includes an additional condition to handle boolean data separately and prevent it from being processed as timestamps. This aligns with the expected behavior for the `read_json` method with `typ="series"`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
