1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert an ndarray-like data into a date column. It first checks for empty data and returns early if the data is empty. Next, it tries to convert the data to `int64` if the dtype is "object" and then checks for numbers that are out of range. Finally, it attempts to convert the data to a datetime object using various date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conversion of data to `int64` and the subsequent check for numbers that are out of range.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be that the conversion to `int64` may not handle all cases of epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch formats correctly, leading to an incorrect conversion. Additionally, the check for numbers that are out of range may not be functioning as intended, leading to incorrect results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the conversion to `int64` handles all cases of epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch formats correctly.
   - Reviewing the check for numbers that are out of range to ensure that it accurately identifies numbers that are out of range.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.missing import isna, iNaT
from pandas import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- `pd.to_numeric` is used to coerce object types to numeric, which may handle epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch formats better than `astype("int64")`.
- The check for numbers that are out of range is improved, and it checks for numbers that are out of range and returns the updated new_data and a boolean based on the in_range condition.
- The `pd.to_datetime` function is used to convert the data to a datetime object.
