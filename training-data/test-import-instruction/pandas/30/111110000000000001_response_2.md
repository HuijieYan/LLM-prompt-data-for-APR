1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It appears to be attempting to convert a data array into a date column by parsing and coercing object types into epoch/iso formats and integer/float types into epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the handling of the `new_data` variable and the conversion attempts.

3. The bug's cause might be related to the incorrect handling of the `new_data` variable and the conversion process within the function. Additionally, there are references to variables such as `self.min_stamp`, `self.date_unit`, and `_STAMP_UNITS` within the function, indicating that these variables must be defined and available within the `Parser` class.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the conversion process for object types to ensure that it's being handled correctly, and the exception handling is appropriate.
   - Verifying that the variables `self.min_stamp`, `self.date_unit`, and `_STAMP_UNITS` are properly initialized within the `Parser` class.
   - Making sure that the data type of `new_data` is appropriately handled throughout the function.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    
    def __init__(self, min_stamp, date_unit):
        self.min_stamp = min_stamp
        self.date_unit = date_unit
        self._STAMP_UNITS = ['ms', 's']  # assuming _STAMP_UNITS is a list of supported date units

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype('int64')
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The `Parser` class has been initialized with `min_stamp` and `date_unit` values to ensure that they are available to the `_try_convert_to_date` method.
- The handling of `new_data` conversion for object types and numeric types has been retained, but the exception handling has been updated to use `new_data` instead of `data`.
- The date units are located in the `date_units` variable, and the `to_datetime` conversion is attempted for each unit, returning the result if successful.
