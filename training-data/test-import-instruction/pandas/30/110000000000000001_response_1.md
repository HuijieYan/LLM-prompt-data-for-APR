1. The buggy function is trying to convert data into a date column by parsing it into different date formats. It first tries to coerce objects into epoch/iso formats and integers/floats into epoch formats. It then checks for numbers that are out of range and ignores them. Finally, it tries to convert the data into datetime objects using different units.

2. The potential error location within the function is the handling of the new_data variable and the conversion to datetime objects.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the different potential data types and formats correctly, leading to errors during conversion to datetime objects.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for different data types and formats and handling them accordingly before attempting to convert to datetime.
   - Adding more specific error handling for conversion to datetime.
   - Checking for empty data before performing any operations.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        try:
            new_data = np.asarray(data, dtype=np.int64)
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we handle different potential data types and formats by first checking if the data type is "object" and trying to convert it to "int64". If that fails, we try to convert it to "int64" directly using numpy. We also handle errors during the conversion to datetime more specifically. We also check for empty data before performing any operations.
