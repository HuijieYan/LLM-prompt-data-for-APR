1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the `_json.py` file within the `pandas` repository. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is located in the `test_pandas.py` file. The failing test is attempting to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it into a series. The error message indicates that the boolean values are not convertible to datetime, which suggests that there is an issue with the conversion logic within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it tries to convert the data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the fact that boolean values are not being handled correctly during the conversion process.

3. (a) The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert a given data array into a datetime format.
   (b) The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` function and is responsible for parsing JSON data.
   (c) The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is attempting to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it into a series. The error message indicates that the boolean values are not convertible to datetime, which points to a problem within the conversion logic of `_try_convert_to_date`.
   (d) The error message indicates that <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime, which indicates that the conversion logic within the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not handling boolean values properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a conditional check in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and convert them to a compatible format for the datetime conversion.
   - Validate the input data type and handle boolean values before attempting the datetime conversion.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.errors import iNaT
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

class Parser():
    # ... existing code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            if new_data.dtype == "object":
                try:
                    new_data = data.astype("int64")
                except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                    # Handle boolean values separately
                    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
                        new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Convert boolean to int
            # ... existing code ...
``` 

In this corrected code, an additional conditional check is added to handle boolean values separately and convert them to a compatible format for datetime conversion. This should address the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
