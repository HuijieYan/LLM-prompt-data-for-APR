The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins`. The `bin_edges` is calculated using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function, and the `bins` are generated based on these `bin_edges`. However, the calculations for `bin_edges` and `bins` seem to be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.

The bug's cause could be that the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` is not properly taking into account the timezone information and the frequency of the input `DatetimeIndex`. This is leading to incorrect bin edges and bins being generated.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the timezone information is properly handled when calculating `bin_edges` and `bins`.
2. Carefully considering the frequency of the input `DatetimeIndex` when generating the `bin_edges` and `bins`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    bin_edges = binner.values  # Use the values of binner as bin_edges
    bins = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax.asi8) - 1  # Generate bins based on bin_edges

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, `bin_edges` is assigned the values of `binner`, and `bins` are generated based on these `bin_edges` using `np.searchsorted`. This ensures that the timezone information and frequency of the input `DatetimeIndex` are properly handled when generating the bins.
