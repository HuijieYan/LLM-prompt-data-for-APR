1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method within the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba, which results in an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function could be in the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps, especially on the day of the clock change.

3. (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is responsible for creating time bins and labels for grouping time intervals. The incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps may lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class contains the `_get_time_bins` function and is used for custom groupby operations on time intervals.
   (c). The GitHub issue details a specific scenario in which the groupby operation fails on a clock change day in Cuba, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
   - Improving the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps, especially around clock change days.
   - Ensuring that the time bins and labels are generated correctly, taking into account any potential ambiguous time situations.
   - Validating the behavior of the groupby operation with daily frequency on days with potential time ambiguities.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels
    
    if self.freq == '1D' and ax.tz:
        inferred_freq = pd.infer_freq(ax)
        if inferred_freq == 'D' and ax.hour.iloc[0] != 0:
            ax = ax - pd.Timedelta(hours=ax.hour.iloc[0])

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax.min(),
        end=ax.max(),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code accounts for potential time ambiguities on days with clock changes, especially when using daily frequency (`'1D'`). It uses the `pd.infer_freq` function to infer the frequency of the index and adjusts the start time accordingly. This should address the reported issue of the groupby operation failing on clock change days in Cuba.
