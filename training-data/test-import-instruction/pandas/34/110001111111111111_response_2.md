The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling ambiguous time during the transition to standard time. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group the data using `pd.Grouper`.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the calculation of `first` and `last` which does not handle the transition to standard time properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of `first` and `last` takes into account the transition to standard time. This can be done by directly using the `Timestamp` instead of calling `replace()` on them.

Additionally, we need to adjust the labels and bins based on the transition to standard time to ensure that the grouping is done correctly without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the transition to standard time properly and perform the grouping without raising an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
