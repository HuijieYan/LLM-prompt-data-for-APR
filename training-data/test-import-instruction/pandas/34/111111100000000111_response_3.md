The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to group time interval data and is a member of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. It is called by the `groupby` function in pandas to group the data based on a given time frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables. The `binner` and `labels` are calculated using the `date_range` function, which might not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue described in the GitHub post. This leads to incorrect grouping of the time intervals, especially on days with local time changes.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to use a different method to calculate the `binner` and `labels` that handles ambiguous timestamps correctly. This might involve using a more robust method to calculate the time bins and labels, especially when dealing with timezones and daylight saving time changes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_backward",  # Adjusting for daylight saving time changes
    )

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected code, the `date_range` function now includes the `nonexistent="shift_backward"` parameter, which helps in adjusting for daylight saving time changes and potentially avoids the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue. This modification should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
