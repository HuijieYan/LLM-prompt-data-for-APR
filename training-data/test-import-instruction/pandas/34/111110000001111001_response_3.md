The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is meant to generate time bins based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. The function initially checks if the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it's not. This part of the code appears to be correct.

The function then proceeds to generate `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. It also calculates `bin_edges` and `bins`. These operations seem fine based on the input values. However, the discrepancy arises when the function tries to adjust the `labels` based on the `closed` and `label` attributes. This adjustment seems to be incorrect as it leads to a mismatch in the size of `labels` and `bins`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the adjustment of the labels based on the `closed` and `label` attributes.

The bug's cause is an incorrect adjustment of the `labels` which results in a mismatch between the size of `labels` and `bins`.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the labels should be modified to ensure that the size of `labels` matches that of `bins`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]  # Adjust the labels based on the size of bins

    return binner, bins, labels
```
The corrected code includes a fix to adjust the `labels` based on the size of `bins` to ensure that they align properly.
