The buggy function is `_get_time_bins()` in the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. The function is called when performing a groupby operation on a DataFrame with a datetime index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of bin edges and labels using the `date_range` function. This seems to lead to an AmbiguousTimeError due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, stating that on a long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The call to `groupby` raises an AmbiguousTimeError, which is not expected behavior.

To fix the bug, it seems that the handling of ambiguous timestamps needs to be improved, possibly by using the `ambiguous` parameter when calling `date_range`. This could help to manage the ambiguous timestamps and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised.

Based on the analysis and the potential cause, we can suggest the following approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` call within the `_get_time_bins` function.
2. Use the `ambiguous` parameter to explicitly handle ambiguous times, setting it to "NaT" if necessary.
3. Ensure that the bin edges and labels are calculated correctly, taking into account the possibility of ambiguous timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by marking them as NaT
        closed=self.closed  # Set closed parameter as needed
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code uses the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to explicitly handle ambiguous times by marking them as NaT. This approach should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
