The issue appears to stem from the fact that the function is not handling ambiguous timestamps (due to the clock change day in Cuba) properly. This is leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data by day.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely the handling of labels and bins for the ambiguous timestamp.

The bug's cause is related to the handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba, specifically in the `bin_edges` calculation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba. This could include adjusting the calculation of `labels` and `bins` for the ambiguous timestamp.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        labels = binner
        
        if self.label == "right":
            # Adjust labels for right labeling
            labels = labels - Timedelta(self.freq.n, self.freq.freqstr)
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            # Insert NaT at the beginning for NaN values
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        # Adjust labels if there are more labels than bins
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function should handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba by adjusting the labels and bins to properly account for the ambiguous time. This solution should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data by day.
