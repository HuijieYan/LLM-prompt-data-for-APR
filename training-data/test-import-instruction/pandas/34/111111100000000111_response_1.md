1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a member of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The function uses other functions within the same file, including `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. The Github issue is related to a problem with `pd.Grouper` failing with `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `get_time_bins` function is likely in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels`. The function is not handling ambiguous time properly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the fact that the function does not handle ambiguous time during the calculation of `binner` and `labels`. This causes issues on a clock change day, such as the one reported in the GitHub issue. The related functions such as `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges` are involved in the relevant calculations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Updating the calculation of `binner` and `labels` to properly handle ambiguous time, taking into account the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue.
   - Ensuring that the `closed` and `label` parameters are correctly handled for ambiguous time situations.
   - Testing the function with various time scenarios, including clock change days, to ensure it handles them properly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use first/last directly instead of calling replace() on them
    # Handle ambiguous time by using the 'ambiguous' parameter
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By incorporating proper handling of ambiguous time in the calculation of `binner` and `labels`, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
