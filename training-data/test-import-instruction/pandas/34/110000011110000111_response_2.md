The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for creating time bins for resampling in the pandas library. The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to use the resampling function and is failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError`. The error occurs when trying to group the DataFrame by day and the group contains an ambiguous timestamp due to a daylight saving time change.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of timezone conversions, especially around the ambiguous time that occurs during a daylight saving time change.

The failing test function is trying to down-sample data using `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of "1D". This is causing an issue when the timestamps fall on a day with a daylight saving time change, leading to ambiguous time errors.

The GitHub issue also describes the problem as occurring during a long clock-change day in Cuba, where midnight is an ambiguous timestamp.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the ambiguous timestamps during daylight saving time changes explicitly in the `_get_time_bins` function. This can be achieved by checking for ambiguous times and handling them appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Handle ambiguous times during daylight saving time changes
    start = first.tz_convert(ax.tz)
    end = last.tz_convert(ax.tz)
    if start != first or end != last:
        start = start - timedelta(seconds=1)  # adjust start time for ambiguous time
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=start,
            end=end,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="NaT",  # handle ambiguous time as NaT
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    else:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version handles the ambiguous times explicitly by adjusting the start time and handling ambiguous times as NaT. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and allow the test case to pass.

With this correction, the GitHub issue related to the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba should also be resolved.
