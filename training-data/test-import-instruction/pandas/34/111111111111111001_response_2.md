The potential error location within the buggy function can be found at the following lines:
```python
binner = labels = date_range(
    freq=self.freq,
    start=first,
    end=last,
    tz=ax.tz,
    name=ax.name,
    ambiguous="infer",
    nonexistent="shift_forward",
)
```
The function is using `date_range` without importing it. This leads to the code failing to execute and causing the test error.

Examine  how the input parameters of the buggy function are related to the failing test and the corresponding error message:
- The failing test is a test for downsampling an index with a specific timezone shift.
- The error message indicates an issue with inferring the daylight saving time from a particular time, which is caused by incorrect handling of the timezone information in the buggy function.

The bug appears to be caused by incorrect handling of timezone information and daylight saving time within the `_get_time_bins` function, which leads to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function should be replaced with the appropriate function for generating date ranges while correctly handling timezone information and daylight saving time. Additionally, make sure that the correct library or module is imported to access the necessary functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
from pandas import Timedelta
import numpy as np

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = pd.to_datetime([])
        return binner, [], labels

    first = pd.Timestamp(np.datetime64(ax.min(), 'ns'), tz=ax.tz)
    last = pd.Timestamp(np.datetime64(ax.max(), 'ns'), tz=ax.tz) + Timedelta(self.freq)
    labels = pd.date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous=np.array([True] * (len(ax) - 1) + [False]),
        nonexistent='shift_forward'
    )

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code should address the issues with timezone handling and daylight saving time inference, ensuring that the function provides the expected output and passes the failing test.
