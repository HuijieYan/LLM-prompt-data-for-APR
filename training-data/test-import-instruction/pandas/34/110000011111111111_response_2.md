The buggy function is `_get_time_bins`, which is part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the pandas library.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError` when calling groupby on a DataFrame with daily frequency and timestamps on a clock change day in Cuba.

The failing test provided a specific input range and expected output. It expects the grouping to handle the ambiguous time at midnight during the clock change day correctly.

The function `_get_time_bins` processes the input `ax` (a DatetimeIndex object) to generate time bins for the specified frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be the incorrect handling of time bins and labels, which leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping on a day with a clock change.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect generation of time bins and labels for the given frequency, resulting in an `AmbiguousTimeError` during grouping.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_time_bins` needs to be modified to correctly handle the ambiguous time at midnight during the clock change day and generate the time bins and labels accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    binner = labels = ax.floor(self.freq, ambiguous='infer')

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code addresses the handling of ambiguous time during the clock change day when generating time bins and labels. It uses the `floor` method to handle the ambiguous time issue and ensures the correct generation of time bins and labels for grouping.

The above changes should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and in the GitHub issue. It should handle the ambiguous time at midnight during the clock change day and pass the failing test successfully.
