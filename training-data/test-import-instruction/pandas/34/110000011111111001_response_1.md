The error occurs due to the incorrect computation of time bins, which leads to an ambiguous time error when the bins are created based on the provided timestamps. This error is due to incorrect binning produced by the `_get_time_bins` function, which is called when resampling the data.

The issue is that the bin edges are not aligned correctly with the given timestamps, leading to ambiguous time errors in the resulting bins.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be modified to compute the correct bin edges and labels for the given timestamps.

The corrected function should first extract the start and end timestamps from the provided `ax` (timestamps) and then use those to appropriately generate the bin edges and labels within the specified frequency. Moreover, since the group frequency is a day, the specific timezone adjustments need to be handled carefully.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # compute the start and end timestamps from the ax
    start = ax.min()
    end = ax.max()

    # generate the date range using the appropriate timezone
    # make the bin edges by specifying the frequency and timezone
    binner = labels = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # generate the bins based on the bin edges and timestamps
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the bins are correctly generated based on the input timestamps, and the ambiguous time error should be resolved. Additionally, this corrected function will align the bin edges and labels correctly with the given timestamps. This should enable the function to produce the correct output and pass the failing test for the given input parameters.
