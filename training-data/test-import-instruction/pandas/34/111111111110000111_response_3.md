1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. This class has a method called `_adjust_bin_edges`, which is called by the `_get_time_bins` function. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` calls the `groupby` method with a daily frequency, which eventually leads to the error.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely related to the computation of bin edges and labels, especially around the ambiguous time when the clock changes.

3. The bug is caused by the function `_get_time_bins` not handling the ambiguous time during a clock change day, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group by daily frequency. The error is related to how bin edges and labels are computed within the `_get_time_bins` function. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` provides the specific error message `AmbiguousTimeError` related to the handling of ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve adjusting the computation of bin edges and labels within the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times during clock change days. This might involve using `pytz` or similar libraries to handle time zone conversions and ambiguous times more robustly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function to address the issue:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=ax.min(),
            periods=1,
            freq=self.freq,
            name=ax.name,
            tz=ax.tz,
        )
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code attempts to handle the ambiguous time during a clock change day more robustly, addressing the specific issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

By applying this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the specific issue highlighted in the GitHub description should be resolved.
