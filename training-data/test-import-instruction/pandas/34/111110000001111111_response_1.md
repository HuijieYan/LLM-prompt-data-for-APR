Based on the GitHub issue and the provided information, it seems that the problem arises from the handling of ambiguous timestamps, especially on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The issue manifests itself as an AmbiguousTimeError when using the groupby function with a daily frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function can be identified as the handling of timestamp ranges and bin edges, specifically on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
(a). The buggy function:
    - The _get_time_bins function is responsible for creating time bins based on the given DatetimeIndex and other parameters.
(b). The buggy class:
    - The TimeGrouper class contains the _get_time_bins function and related methods for time-interval grouping.
(c). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value:
    - The input parameters, binner, labels, and other variables in the function have values that do not align with the expected output and lead to an AmbiguousTimeError.
(d). The GitHub Issue information:
    - The issue describes the expected behavior of the groupby function and points out the specific problem related to the long clock-change day in Cuba.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adding handling for ambiguous timestamps, especially on the day of a clock change in the relevant timezone.
2. Adjusting the logic for generating bin edges and time labels to accommodate ambiguous timestamps during grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].normalize()
    last = ax[-1].normalize() + Timedelta(days=1) - Timedelta(nanoseconds=1)
    if ax[-1].tz:
        last = last.tz_localize(ax[-1].tz, ambiguous="infer")

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code adjusts the logic for handling ambiguous timestamps and generates time bins and labels more robustly, considering the issue on the day of the clock change in Cuba. This approach aims to resolve the AmbiguousTimeError described in the GitHub issue.
