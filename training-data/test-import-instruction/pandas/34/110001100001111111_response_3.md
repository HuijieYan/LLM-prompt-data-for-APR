The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function seems to be related to handling the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba. The function is not properly handling the time bins and labels for the groupby operation.

The error location within the problematic function is likely in the computation of `first` and `last` and the subsequent generation of `binner` and `labels`. This seems to be causing the issue with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.

The expected output is that the call to groupby should return three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and should contain the 25 hourly data points for that day.

To fix the bug, the computation of `first`, `last`, `binner`, and `labels` needs to be adjusted so that the ambiguous time on the clock change day is properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Fix for handling ambiguous timestamp on clock change day in Cuba
    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D')

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
