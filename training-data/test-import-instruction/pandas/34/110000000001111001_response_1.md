The bug in the function is likely to be in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function call, where `binner` and `ax_values` are used as input parameters. This function likely adjusts the bin edges based on the binner and ax_values, and it seems to be the cause of the discrepancy observed in the bins variable. This issue arises because there is no information on the `_adjust_bin_edges` function logic and its implementation, so without seeing that function, it's hard to determine what exactly is going wrong.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to carefully examine the logic within the `_adjust_bin_edges` function and make sure that it adjusts the bin edges correctly based on the input parameters `binner` and `ax_values`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bin_edges = np.concatenate((binner[[0]], binner[1:] - np.timedelta64(1, 'ns')))
    bins = np.digitize(ax.asi8, bin_edges, right=self.closed=='right')

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the `_adjust_bin_edges` function call has been replaced with the logic to calculate bin_edges using NumPy functions based on the `binner` and `ax_values`. This should provide a correct and efficient way to achieve the same result without the potential bugs associated with the previous implementation.
