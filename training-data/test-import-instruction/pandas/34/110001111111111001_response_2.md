The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is causing the failing test. The error message indicates that the function is unable to infer the daylight saving time at a specific point in time, which is likely due to the incorrect generation of `bin_edges` and `bins`.

The issue seems to be with the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` in the `_get_time_bins` function. It looks like the function is not handling the transition between different DST offsets correctly, leading to the "AmbiguousTimeError" when trying to generate the result.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to handle the transitions between different DST offsets properly. This can be achieved by refining the calculation and adjustment of `bin_edges` based on the time zone information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Refine the calculation of bins and labels based on bin_edges
    bins = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax_values, side='right') - 1
    if self.closed == "right":
        bins_right = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax_values, side='right')
        labels = binner[bins_right]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner[bins]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With the above correction, the `_get_time_bins` function should now be able to handle the transitions between different DST offsets and generate the correct bins and labels, ensuring that the daylight saving time is correctly inferred, and the "AmbiguousTimeError" is avoided.

After applying the provided correction, the function should pass the failing test and generate the expected output.
