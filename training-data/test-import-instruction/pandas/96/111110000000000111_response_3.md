```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions from the same class (not shown for brevity)

    # this is the fixed function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # logic for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and holidays
            # ...
            # (existing code)

            # handle holidays
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # (remaining code for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The above code represents the corrected version of the apply() function within the BusinessHourMixin class. It includes the additional handling for holidays to ensure that they are properly accounted for in the adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and provide the expected behavior for the date_range function when using periods and holidays.
