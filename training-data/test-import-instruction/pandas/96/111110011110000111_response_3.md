1. Analysis:
The buggy function "apply" within the BusinessHourMixin class is causing the issue. The failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" is showing that when using periods and adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour, the date_range function is producing more than the specified number of periods. The error message indicates a ValueError when validating the frequency.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely in the logic that handles the adjustment of business days and business hours within the "apply" function.

3. Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours within the "apply" function, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date_range function.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
a. Adjust the logic for handling business days and business hours to ensure the correct number of periods in the date_range function.
b. Validate the frequency properly to avoid the ValueError in the failing test.

5. Corrected Code for the "apply" function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businessdays = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay()
        
        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        # Adjust other based on n
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other += businessdays
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= businessdays
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code simplifies the adjustment of business days and hours based on the value of n. It also handles the offset and opening time adjustments correctly. This should resolve the issue and the failing test case.

Additionally, the frequency validation within the CustomBusinessHour class could be modified to handle the passed frequency and inferred frequency correctly to avoid the ValueError.

By using this corrected code, the failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
