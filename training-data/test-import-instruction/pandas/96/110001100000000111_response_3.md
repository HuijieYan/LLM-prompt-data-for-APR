1. The buggy function seems to be related to the `pd.date_range` function in the pandas library, which is used to create a range of dates with a custom frequency. The issue in the GitHub post is about the `pd.date_range` producing more periods than specified when holidays are added.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic used to adjust the dates based on business hours and holidays.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function contains logic to adjust dates based on business hours, but it may not be handling the addition of holidays correctly.
   (b). The related functions such as `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time` seem to be used to calculate business hours and opening/closing times, which are essential for the functionality of the buggy function.
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that the behavior of the `pd.date_range` is affected when holidays are added, resulting in more periods being generated than expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic in the `apply` function to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for when adjusting dates based on business hours.
   - Confirm that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours consider the presence of holidays.
   - Verify that the calculation of business hours and opening/closing times is accurate, especially when holidays are involved.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the bug and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)

        result = other + business_hour * n
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the `CustomBusinessHour` object is used to handle the adjustments for business hours, opening/closing times, and holidays. This should ensure that the behavior of `pd.date_range` is consistent and produces the expected number of periods even when holidays are added.
