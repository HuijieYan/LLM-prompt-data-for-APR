1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas repository and it seems to be related to the issue reported on GitHub about the date_range not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function could be the calculation and adjustment of business hours, especially the logic for adjusting other to reduce the number of cases to handle.

3. The cause of the bug could be that the buggy function is not correctly adjusting for holidays when calculating business hours, leading to incorrect output from the date_range function. The function may not be handling the adjustment of dates properly in the presence of holidays.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for adjusting business hours and ensuring that it takes holidays into account properly.
   - Checking if the adjustment of dates for business days and remaining business hours is accurate when holidays are present.
   - Testing the function with different combinations of dates, periods, and holidays to identify the specific scenario where the bug occurs.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other.weekday() in self.weekmask and other not in self.holidays:
            cbh = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
            return cbh.rollback(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code improves the logic for adjusting business hours and properly handles holidays when using the CustomBusinessHour. It should help resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
