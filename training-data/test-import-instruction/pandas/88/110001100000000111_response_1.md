The buggy function `pivot_table` is used to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. The GitHub issue states that there is an AttributeError when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns, and it expects the result to be symmetrical between rows/columns and single/multi case.

Looking at the code and the GitHub issue, the potential error location within the `pivot_table` function could be the block of code that checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1` and then tries to access `table[values[0]]`. This is likely causing the AttributeError when `table` is a Series object and does not have the attribute `columns`.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the assumption that `table` will always be a DataFrame, which is not the case when multi-index columns are used.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `table` is a DataFrame before trying to access its columns. If `table` is a Series, the appropriate handling should be done to ensure that the operation is successful.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and len(table.index.nlevels) > 1:
        # Proper handling for Series with multi-index
        table = table.unstack()

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `table` is a DataFrame and has multi-index columns, then proceed with the `table[values[0]]` operation. We also added a condition to handle Series objects with multi-index using the `unstack` method.

With this correction, the bug should be resolved and the `pivot_table` function should work as expected, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
