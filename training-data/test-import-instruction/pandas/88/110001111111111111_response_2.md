The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The error message from the failing test indicates an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` when trying to access the columns attribute. This suggests that the buggy function is returning a Series instead of a DataFrame.

After analyzing the input and output variables, it's clear that the bug is related to the line `if (table.columns.nlevels > 1):` in the function. This line is trying to check the number of levels in the columns attribute, but it's failing because the table variable is a Series instead of a DataFrame.

The `pivot_table` function is being recursively called with the same parameters within a loop that iterates over the `aggfunc` list. This recursive call is causing the unexpected behavior and returning a Series instead of a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we should avoid the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the loop. Instead, we can calculate the different aggregation functions separately and then combine them into a single DataFrame at the end.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Original implementation
    # ...

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        table = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
        
        if dropna and isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and len(table.columns):
            table = table.dropna(how="all")

    # ...
```

With this correction, the function avoids recursive calls to itself and properly aggregates the data using the different functions in the `aggfunc` list. This should resolve the issue and make the function return a DataFrame instead of a Series.
