The issue has been identified as occurring due to checks for multi-level column indexes in the pivot_table function. The function mistakenly attempts to access the `.columns` attribute on a Series object, leading to an AttributeError.

To address this issue, the buggy pivot_table function can be corrected as follows:

```python
# Fixed pivot_table function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # (existing code...)
    
    if len(data.columns) > 1:
        table = table.T
    
    # (existing code...)
```

By adding a condition to check if the number of columns in the data is greater than 1, we can prevent accessing the `.columns` attribute on a Series object. This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue observed in the failing test cases with multi-index columns.

Once the fix has been implemented, the corrected pivot_table function can be tested again with the previously failing test cases to ensure that the issue has been resolved. Additionally, existing test cases for pivot_table should be re-run to cover normal and edge cases involving multi-index columns.
