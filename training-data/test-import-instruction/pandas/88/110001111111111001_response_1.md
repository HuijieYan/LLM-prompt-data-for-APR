### Bug Analysis

The failing tests are trying to call the `pivot_table` function with different combinations of columns as input. The failing error message indicates an issue with the `Series` object not having an attribute called 'columns'. Additionally, the expected and actual output variable information shows the `table` variable storing the resulting DataFrame, has multiple values appended based on the combination of columns passed as input. This is causing the `Series` object issue, as it is not able to handle data with multiple columns correctly.

### Bug Location
The issue is likely occurring in the part of the code where `aggfunc` is a list and a loop is used to call the `pivot_table` function multiple times. The concatenation and aggregation of the resulting DataFrames might be causing results which cannot be handled correctly as a `Series` object.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the issue is the incorrect handling of the transformation logic when the `aggfunc` is a list and the `pivot_table` function is called multiple times within this loop. This results in concatenated DataFrames, causing issues further while handling them as a `Series` object.

### Proposed Fix
To address this issue, the logic for handling the `aggfunc` list and concatenating the DataFrames should be re-evaluated. It should ensure that the resulting DataFrame is appropriately handled and does not cause issues when used as a `Series` object.

### The Corrected Function

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if len(pieces) == 0:
                pieces.append(table)
            else:
                pieces.append(table.rename(columns=lambda x: f"{x}_{func}"))
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        result = pieces[0] if len(pieces) == 1 else concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
        return result

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function includes a modification to handle the concatenated DataFrames appropriately when `aggfunc` is a list. The resulting DataFrame is renamed based on the function and concatenated, if multiple DataFrames are created. This approach should ensure that the resulting DataFrame is correctly handled and does not cause the same issue when used as a `Series` object.
