The issue arises because the `clocs` variable is being passed as a tuple in some cases, which leads to an incorrect index look-up in the function `_get_level_number`. 

To address this issue, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be updated to account for the cases where `clocs` is a tuple. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Handle the case where clocs is a tuple
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... (other existing code)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function will handle both lists and tuples appropriately, avoiding the KeyError or ValueError issues that were occurring.

Once the fix for the `_unstack_multiple` function is implemented, the failing tests should then pass successfully.
