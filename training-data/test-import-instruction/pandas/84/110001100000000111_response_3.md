The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is part of the pandas repository and is causing issues with the `unstack` function for MultiIndexed data. The function is supposed to handle unstacking of MultiIndexed data, but it is failing when it comes to unstacking with tuple names, resulting in a KeyError.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the lines where the `clocs` are being processed:
```python
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is trying to get the level number for each item in `clocs` from the index. However, in the provided GitHub issue, there is a KeyError being raised because the level 'A' is not found, which implies that the function is expecting the levels to be a single string, not a tuple.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling MultiIndexed data with tuple names correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to unstack with tuple names.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to properly handle MultiIndexed data with tuple names. This could involve checking for tuple names and appropriately processing them to extract the individual level names before attempting unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
    ...

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version, the `clocs` list is modified to check if the item is a string or a tuple, and then appropriately handle getting the level number. This should address the issue with tuple names causing a KeyError when unstacking.
