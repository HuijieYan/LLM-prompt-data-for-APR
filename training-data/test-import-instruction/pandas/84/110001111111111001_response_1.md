The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the handling of multi-level indices. The error message indicates that the function is not able to find the level specified in the input parameter, which causes a `KeyError` to be raised. This is likely due to the way the `clocs` (column locations) are being processed within the function.

The function is intended to unstack a multi-index DataFrame based on the specified column locations. However, for multi-level indices, the code does not handle the column locations correctly in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle multi-level indices and ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for all types of column locations.

Here are some possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Check the input `clocs` to ensure it is being processed correctly for both single and multi-level column indices.
2. Handle the case of multi-level column indices differently to ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for all scenarios.
3. Consider using the `pandas` library's built-in functionality for unstacking operations to ensure a more robust and reliable implementation.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    if len(index.levels) > 1:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should handle both single and multi-level column indices correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
