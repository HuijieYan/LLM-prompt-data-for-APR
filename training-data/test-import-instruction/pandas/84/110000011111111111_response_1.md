The issue here seems to be that the function `_get_level_number` is not handling tuple names correctly when unstacking a MultiIndex.

The function `_get_level_number` is attempting to find the level number for the given level name. It first checks if the level name is present in the list of names, and if not, it raises a `KeyError` indicating that the level was not found.

Looking at the failing test case, it seems that the issue arises when processing a tuple of level names during unstacking.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_get_level_number` function, where it is not correctly handling the case when the level name is a tuple.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle the case when the level name is a tuple. We can check if the input is a tuple, and if so, iterate over the individual names and find their corresponding level numbers. This should allow us to correctly handle the tuple names and obtain their level numbers for unstacking.

Additionally, the code needs to be modified to process multi-level names correctly and handle tuple names within the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the `_get_level_number` function and the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        return [self.names.index(name) for name in level]
    else:
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(
                f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
            )
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same... 
```

With these modifications, the function should be able to correctly handle tuple names when unstacking a MultiIndex.

Make sure to test the corrected function using the failing test cases provided to ensure that it passes the test and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
