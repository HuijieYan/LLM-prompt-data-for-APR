The issue arises from the incorrect handling of tuple names in the `unstack` function. It seems that the function is not designed to handle names specified as tuples correctly. To fix the issue, the `_get_level_number` function needs to properly handle the case when the provided level is a tuple.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By checking whether the `i` in `clocs` is an integer or not before calling `_get_level_number`, we can handle both single-level and multi-level index names correctly.

This fix should resolve the issues encountered in the failing test cases. It will also address the reported KeyError and ValueError.
