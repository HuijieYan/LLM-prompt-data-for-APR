The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in the `_get_level_number` function. The error occurs when trying to find the index of a level that is specified by a tuple, resulting in a `KeyError` or `ValueError`.

The reason for this error is that the function `_get_level_number` is expecting a single level name, but it's receiving a tuple of level names. This mismatch in the input type is causing the function to throw an error when trying to find the index of the level.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle a tuple of level names correctly and find their corresponding indices in the MultiIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_indices = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_idx = tuple(index._get_level_number(level) for level in cloc)
            cloc_indices.append(cloc_idx)
        else:
            cloc_indices.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the `clocs` and if a `cloc` is a tuple, we obtain the corresponding indices for each level in the tuple using `index._get_level_number`, and if it's a single level name, we find its index as before. We store all the indices in a list `cloc_indices` which is then used in the rest of the code.

This corrected code should handle both single level names and tuples of level names correctly, and it should allow the failing test to pass without throwing any errors.

The corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
