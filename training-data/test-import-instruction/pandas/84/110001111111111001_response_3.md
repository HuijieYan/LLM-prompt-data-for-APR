The bug is caused by the way the `clocs` variable is being used in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is trying to use the names of the levels in the index to retrieve the level number, but it's not handling the case where the level name is a tuple.

The function should handle both single-level and multi-level names when trying to retrieve the level number.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class to handle both single-level and multi-level names when trying to retrieve the level number. This will prevent the ValueError and KeyError exceptions from being raised.

2. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the input `clocs` correctly, accounting for the possibility of tuple names in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if not isinstance(level, tuple):
        level = (level,)

    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )

    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

# ...

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle both single-level and multi-level names in the input `clocs` variable, and the corrected code should pass the failing test cases.
