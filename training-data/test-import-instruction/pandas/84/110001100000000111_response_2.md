1. The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, is responsible for unstacking multiple levels of a DataFrame's index. The function had issues when dealing with MultiIndexes, as seen in the GitHub issue where calling the `unstack` method on a Series with MultiIndex and providing a tuple as the level argument resulted in a KeyError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block that handles the calculation of `clocs` and `rlocs`, as well as in the MultiIndex creation with `dummy_index` and the subsequent logic for unstacking the DataFrame or Series.

3. The bug's cause is an incorrect handling of the MultiIndex levels and names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When handling MultiIndexes, the function had issues with properly identifying the levels and names, which resulted in KeyError when trying to unstack. This caused the unstacking operation to fail, as observed in the GitHub issue's traceback.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly handling the MultiIndex levels and names, ensuring that the necessary information is correctly extracted and used.
   - Implementing checks and logic to handle MultiIndexed DataFrames and Series in a consistent manner.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(level, (list, tuple, set)):
        level = [level]

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in level]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        dummy_index = Index(data.index.get_level_values(clocs[0]).unique(), name='__placeholder__')
    else:
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
        obs_ids, comp_ids = data.index.get_level_values(clocs[0]).factorize()
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                                    codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                                    names=rnames + ['__placeholder__'],
                                    verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index        
        unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)

    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for loc in clocs:
                result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)

        else:
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index        
            unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with handling MultiIndex levels and names, as well as the logic for unstacking the DataFrame or Series. It should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
