The problem with the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of multi-level columns in the `pandas` library. The function is supposed to unstack the multi-index columns, but it fails to do so, resulting in a KeyError.

From the provided input and output variable information, it seems that the function is failing to correctly handle the multi-level column names.

The following approach can be taken to fix the bug:
- Modify the function to ensure it correctly handles multi-level column names.
- Use the correct level numbers for the multi-level columns in the unstacking process.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should properly handle multi-level columns and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
