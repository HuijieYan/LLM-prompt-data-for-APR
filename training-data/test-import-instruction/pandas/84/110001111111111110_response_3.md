The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the `clocs` variable, which is a list of tuples as the index identifier for a multi-level index. The error is raised because the code is trying to get the level number directly from the multi-index using the tuple, which is not supported. 

To fix this issue, the relevant logic to handle multi-level indices with tuple names should be updated. The `clocs` list needs to be converted into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the level names. Then, the corresponding level numbers should be retrieved from the multi-index using the tuples.

Here is the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... existing code ...

    index = data.index

    cloc_tuples = [level_tuple if isinstance(level_tuple, tuple) else (level_tuple,) for level_tuple in clocs]
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level_tuple) for level_tuple in cloc_tuples]


    # ... remaining code ...
```

With this correction, the `clocs` list is first checked for each entry to determine if it is a tuple. If not, it converts that entry into a single-element tuple. The `cloc_numbers` list then uses the tuples in `cloc_tuples` to get the respective level numbers from the multi-index.
