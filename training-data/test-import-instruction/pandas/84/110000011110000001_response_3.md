The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple`, which is used in the `DataFrame.unstack()` method. The failing tests are related to using the `unstack()` method with a multi-level index.

The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with finding the level number for a specified level.

The likely cause of the bug is that the function is not handling hierarchical columns properly, especially when dealing with multi-level index names.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to properly handle hierarchical columns and multi-level index names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to handle the case where `i` is a string (indicating the level name), and we use `index._get_level_number()` to retrieve the level number based on the level name.

This modification should resolve the issue and allow the function to properly handle the multi-level index names when unstacking.
