1. The problematic function '_unstack_multiple' is intended to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels of MultiIndex. The failing test cases 'test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex' and 'test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex' are intended to test the unstacking functionality with different input scenarios. The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to retrieve the level number from the MultiIndex, resulting in a ValueError or KeyError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the section where it tries to retrieve the level number from the index using the '_get_level_number' method.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The '_get_level_number' method is supposed to retrieve the level number based on the level name, but it is failing to do so.
   (b). The function is not handling hierarchical columns, which could be adding to the complexity of unstacking multi-level indexes.
   (c). The failing tests indicate that the unstacking process is not working as expected for multi-level indices with tuple names.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). It might be necessary to review the logic for how level numbers are retrieved and ensure that it can handle multi-level indices with tuple names appropriately.
   (b). The function should also be updated to handle hierarchical columns if that is a requirement.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels,
            codes=index.codes,
            names=index.names,
            verify_integrity=False
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

This corrected code simplifies the unstacking process by using the existing index information in the DataFrame. It removes the need to handle level numbers explicitly and focuses on creating a dummy index for unstacking. The function should now be able to handle multi-level indices with tuple names and pass the failing tests.
