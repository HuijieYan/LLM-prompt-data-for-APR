The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` and it is related to the `unstack` function within the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` file.

The potential error location is likely within the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line of code, as indicated by the "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names, leading to a KeyError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
- Adding error handling to properly handle MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names.
- Reviewing the code that deals with MultiIndexed values to ensure correctness and handling of tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle the possibility of tuple names in `clocs` by using `isinstance(i, (str, tuple))`. If `i` is a tuple, then we use `index._get_level_number(i)` to get the level number. This change should enable proper handling of MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
