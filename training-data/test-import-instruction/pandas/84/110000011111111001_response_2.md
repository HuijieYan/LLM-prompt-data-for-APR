The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used in the context of unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The function tries to unstack the DataFrame using specified clocs (column location) by determining the level number for each column in clocs.

The error in the function is occurring because it expects a level number, but it is receiving a tuple of names instead. This is leading to the ValueError and KeyError being raised during the execution of the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle both level numbers and names as input for clocs.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the section of code where the level number is obtained from the index. In this section, the function should first check if the input is a tuple and contains names, then it should retrieve the level number based on the names. If it's just a single level number, then it should proceed as before.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level = index._get_level_number(loc)
            new_clocs.append(level)
        else:
            new_clocs.append(loc)
        
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function should now be able to handle both level numbers and names as input for clocs.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
