The problematic function in this case is the `_unstack_multiple` function in the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. This function seems to be responsible for unstacking a DataFrame or Series using multiple levels. The error messages from the failing test are related to the retrieval of level numbers and names in the MultiIndex, which indicates that there might be a problem with how this function handles MultiIndex objects.

The function attempts to access levels and names from the index without checking if the index is a MultiIndex or not. This might be the potential error location. Additionally, there are multiple conditional blocks in the function based on the type of the input data (Series or DataFrame) and whether the columns are of MultiIndex type or not. These conditional blocks can also be potential sources of errors.

The failing tests are trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex and are failing due to the issues with handling MultiIndex objects within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error messages indicate that the function is not able to find the specified level in the MultiIndex, which results in KeyError or ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle MultiIndex objects and retrieve the level numbers and names correctly. Additionally, the conditional blocks for different input types and MultiIndex handling need to be reviewed and modified for correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to see if the index is a MultiIndex before trying to retrieve the level number using `_get_level_number`. If the index is not a MultiIndex, the level number is used as is without invoking the `_get_level_number` method.

With this correction, the function should now handle MultiIndex objects correctly and pass the failing tests.
