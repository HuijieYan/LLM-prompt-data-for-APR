The issue arises from the function `_get_level_number` in the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file. The function expects a level name as input but it is getting a tuple, resulting in a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is trying to get the level number for a tuple name, but `_get_level_number` is not able to handle tuple names. This is causing the KeyError.

The bug arises from the `_unstack_multiple` function trying to handle tuple names, but the `_get_level_number` function is not equipped to handle tuple names and raises an error.

To fix this bug, modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle tuple names and related operations, such as getting level numbers from the index, appropriately. Additionally, ensure that the input to the `_unstack_multiple` function is in the expected format.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # If clocs is a tuple, convert it to a list
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    # New code to handle tuple names appropriately
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs[0]]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

```

By making these changes, the function should now be able to handle tuple names and the related operations, thus resolving the bug.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
