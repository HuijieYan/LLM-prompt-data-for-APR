The bug in the _unstack_multiple function is likely caused by incorrect processing of the input parameters and the creation of new indices and columns. The function seems to be attempting to unstack multi-level columns, but it is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly.

To fix the bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to properly handle hierarchical columns and create the new index and columns accordingly. It should also correctly handle the grouping and unstacking of the data.

Here's a possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Update the _unstack_multiple function to correctly handle hierarchical columns by identifying the levels, codes, and names of the columns and processing them accordingly.
2. Use the group_index, comp_ids, obs_ids, and recons_codes to create the new index and columns for the unstacked data.
3. Handle the unstacking process for both DataFrame and Series inputs separately, ensuring that the resulting unstacked data has the correct index and columns.

The corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function, based on the expected input/output variable information, might look something like this:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Perform the unstacking process and create the new index and columns
    # ...

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the unstacking process and creation of the new index and columns will depend on the specific requirements and data structure of the input DataFrame or Series. The above code provides a general outline for fixing the bug based on the provided input/output variable information.
