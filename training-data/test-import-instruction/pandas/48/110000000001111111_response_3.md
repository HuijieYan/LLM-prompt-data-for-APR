The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy with an `Int64` dtype, which results in a TypeError as described in the GitHub issue. The problem occurs when trying to perform the aggregation operation on the grouped data.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the input/output variable information, it seems that the error occurs when trying to perform the aggregation operation with `how='mean'` on integer data with NaN values.

The cause of the bug appears to be the handling of nullable integer data during the aggregation process. The code does not handle nullable integer values appropriately, leading to a TypeError when trying to perform the aggregation.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle nullable integer values during the aggregation process. One approach to fix the bug is to check for and handle nullable integer values before performing the aggregation operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # Handle nullable integers
        values = block.values
        if isinstance(values, pd.array.IntegerArray):
            values = values.to_numpy()
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the error as needed
            pass
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we handle nullable integer values by converting them to regular NumPy arrays before performing the aggregation operation. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue.
