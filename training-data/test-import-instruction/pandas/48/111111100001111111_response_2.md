The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) and its interaction with the `groupby` method. The issue reported in the GitHub description is also related to calling `mean` after grouping resulting in a TypeError. The bug seems to be causing errors when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

The potential error location within the function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types and the subsequent aggregation operations (like mean, median, etc.). The function is likely not properly handling the nullable nature of the integer data type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles nullable integer data types properly and that the aggregation methods (mean, median, etc.) work as expected with nullable integer data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # New code to handle nullable integer data type
    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):
        data = data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

    # Existing code...
```

In this corrected version, we add a check to convert the data to numeric type, handling any nullable values as NaN, before applying the aggregation methods. This should address the issue with nullable integer data types causing errors in the aggregation operations.
