The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type 'Int64' in the DataFrameGroupBy mean function. The error message indicates a TypeError caused by an attempt to cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'. The provided failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue both demonstrate the issue.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue is occurring while trying to perform an aggregation operation on the 'Int64' dtype series within the DataFrameGroupBy class.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _cython_agg_blocks method in the DataFrameGroupBy class to handle nullable integer dtype properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function _cython_agg_blocks:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Calculate mean for nullable integer dtype
        if block.dtype.kind in ['i', 'u'] and not block.is_categorical:
            result = block.values.mean()
            result = np.array([result] * len(block), dtype='float64')
            dtype = 'float64'
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the NotImplementedError if necessary
                pass

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, dtype=dtype)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
With this updated function, the mean calculation for nullable integer dtype is explicitly handled, setting the dtype to 'float64' for mean aggregation. Other aggregation operations can continue as before.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
