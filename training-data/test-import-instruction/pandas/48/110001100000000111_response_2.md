1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used for aggregating data in Pandas. The GitHub issue mentions that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError, indicating that there might be an issue with the aggregation implementation.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the result when certain aggregation functions are called.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using:
   (a). The buggy function:
       - The function first gets the data to aggregate, then iterates through the blocks of data and tries to aggregate them based on a specified function. However, the implementation might not be handling specific data types correctly, leading to the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

   (b). The related functions:
       - The `aggregate` function is called to perform the aggregation on the data. It takes in a function, *args, and **kwargs as input arguments.

   (c). The GitHub Issue information:
       - The issue is raised when calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError, specifically when using the new nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64').

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for specific data types like nullable integers and handle them appropriately during aggregation.
   - Ensure that the aggregation functions are able to handle all possible data types, including the new nullable integer data type.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if issubclass(block.dtype.type, pd.Int64Dtype):
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the error 
                continue
        else:
            # Handle other data types
            result = no_result
            continue
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code snippet checks if the block's data type is a nullable integer (`pd.Int64Dtype`) and handles it appropriately during aggregation. This should address the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
