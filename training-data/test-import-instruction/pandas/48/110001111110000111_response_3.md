The bug in the code is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. This is resulting in an error related to the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64.

The issue is likely within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is responsible for performing aggregation on the grouped data. The error is occurring when trying to cast float64 values to int64, which is not possible.

To fix this issue, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the safe casting of values to the appropriate dtype. This can be achieved by ensuring that float values are not cast to int if they are non-equivalent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        result = result.astype(block.dtype)  # Ensure result is of the original block dtype

        # Create a new block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items
    
    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = agg_items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code should handle the aggregation and casting of values to ensure that the safe casting from float64 to int64 is appropriately handled.

This should resolve the TypeError when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
