```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
        
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        agg_dict = {}
        
        for key, block in data.blocks.items():
            if block.isdigit():
                agg_dict[key] = block.mean(min_count=min_count)
            elif alt is not None:
                try:
                    result = block.agg(alt)  # Call our grouper again with only this block
                    agg_dict[key] = result
                except ValueError:
                    pass  # Ignore ValueError
                    
        agg_blocks = [Block(agg_dict[key]) for key in agg_dict]
        agg_items = list(agg_dict)
        
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The changes made in the code to fix the bug include: 
1. Create an empty `agg_dict` to store the aggregation results for each key.
2. Iterate over the blocks of data and aggregate each block based on whether it's numeric or alternative method is provided.
3. Create `agg_blocks` by wrapping the aggregated values into a new Block and store the corresponding keys in `agg_items`.
4. Return `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.
