1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class and related functions:
   - The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a member of the class `DataFrameGroupBy` in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
   - It calls the function `_get_data_to_aggregate` from the same class to get the data to aggregate.
   - The function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be responsible for aggregating data in some way, possibly involving numerical operations.

2. Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:
   - The potential error within the function could be related to the aggregation process itself, potentially involving how the data is treated and how it is aggregated.

3. Elucidating the bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be responsible for aggregating data based on the specified conditions (how, alt, numeric_only, min_count).
   (b) The class `DataFrameGroupBy` seems to be related to grouping and aggregating data within a DataFrame.
   (c) The related function `_get_data_to_aggregate` is responsible for retrieving the data to be aggregated. Possible issues could arise from this step, as it directly affects the input data for aggregation.

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the aggregation logic to ensure that it correctly handles all possible scenarios and inputs.
   - Check the logic related to the `agg_blocks` and `new_items` to ensure the proper aggregation of data.
   - Address any potential issues related to the handling of exceptions, especially in the case of NotImplementedError.

5. Corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # ... (previous code)

        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
        if split_frames:
            # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
            for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
                assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
                for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                    new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                    agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

        # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))
        
        # ... (previous code)

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
