1. The `TypeError` is occurring due to the attempted cast from `float64` to `int64` in the failing test.
2. The error is likely occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where some form of type casting is being done.
3. (a) The buggy function is performing aggregation on the groupby using an unsupported casting between `float64` and `int64`. It is also manipulating the dtype 'Int64' which could be a potential point of failure.
   (b) The failing test is calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object and the error message is related to the failure in casting from `float64` to `int64`.
   (c) The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where calling `mean` with a nullable integer type results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, the problematic type casting needs to be handled properly. This can be achieved by explicitly converting the values to `float` before performing the aggregation operation. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the nullable integer type differently to avoid the TypeError.
5. Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                # call our grouper again with only this block
                result = pd.DataFrame({block.name: block.values}).groupby(self.grouper.groupings)._cython_agg_general("mean")
            else:
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = Block(result, block.mgr_locs, block.flags)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function handles the aggregation of blocks differently and less vulnerable to casting errors. It should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
