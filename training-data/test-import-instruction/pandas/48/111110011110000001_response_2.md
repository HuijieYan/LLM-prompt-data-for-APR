The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the class `DataFrameGroupBy`. It seems that the bug is related to the data type conversion issue, as indicated by the error message stating "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')". The function is attempting to cast float values to int64, which causes the TypeError.

The failing test is trying to apply various aggregation functions to nullable integer data, and it seems that the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
1. Checking the data type of the values before performing any operations on them and to handle nullable integer types appropriately.
2. Ensuring that the function correctly handles the conversion of float values to nullable integer data type, if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with potential fixes:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing code ...

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype.kind == 'f' and isinstance(result, (np.ndarray, float)):  # Check if dtype is float
                result = result.astype('Int64')  # Convert to nullable integer type

            # other existing code...

    # ... existing code ...
```

Please note that the actual fix may require additional changes depending on the specific handling of nullable integer data types in the DataFrameGroupBy class.

After applying the suggested fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
