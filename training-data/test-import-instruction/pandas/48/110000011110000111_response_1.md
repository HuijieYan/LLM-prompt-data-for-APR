## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be causing a TypeError when an operation like `mean`, `median`, or `var` is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message mentions the `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` file, indicating that the issue might be related to the integer data type handling.

## Bug Cause
The error seems to be occurring in the `safe_cast` function, where values are being casted from `float64` to `int64`, but the casting rule 'safe' is not allowing this conversion, resulting in a TypeError.

## Approach for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting from `float64` to `int64` is handled properly, especially when used in operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # other code remains unchanged
        # ...

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.dtype == "Int64" and result.dtype == "float64":
                # Handling the casting from float64 to Int64
                try:
                    result = result.astype("Int64")
                except TypeError:
                    if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating):
                        offset = np.timedelta64(0, "D") if result.dtype == "timedelta64" else 0
                        result = lib.maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype="Int64", copy=False, offset=offset)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this corrected code, we are handling the casting from `float64` to `Int64` specifically for `Block` dtype of "Int64", and then proceeding with the aggregation operations. This should resolve the TypeError issue when performing operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
