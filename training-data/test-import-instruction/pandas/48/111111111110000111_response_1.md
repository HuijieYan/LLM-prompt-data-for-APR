The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype columns, resulting in a `TypeError`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'.

Upon analyzing the provided code and the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the data type casting within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the function seems to be attempting to cast float64 values to int64, which is not valid for nullable integer dtype.

The bug seems to be caused by the attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the data type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be adjusted to handle nullable integer dtype appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # rest of the code remains the same

    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code remains the same

        if numeric_only:
            # Adjust the data type casting to handle nullable integer dtype
            if block.is_numeric:
                local_dtype = block.dtype
                if is_integer_dtype(local_dtype) and isna_func(block.values).any():
                    local_dtype = pd.Float64Dtype()

                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
                result, dtype = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=local_dtype)
            else:
                # Handle non-numeric columns
                result, dtype = self._cython_operation(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )

        # rest of the code remains the same

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the data type casting logic has been adjusted to handle nullable integer dtype appropriately using `pd.Float64Dtype` when encountering NA values in integer columns.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the TypeError when calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer dtype columns.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.
