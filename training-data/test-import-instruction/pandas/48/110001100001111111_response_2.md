The bug in the code seems to be related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. This is evident from the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError when using the new nullable integer data type.

The problem seems to be related to the data type being used, as it works with int64 dtype and with Int64 dtype when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the `agg_blocks` and `result` variables. The code is trying to perform an aggregation operation on Int64 data type using the mean function, which is resulting in a TypeError.

The bug's cause is the incompatibility of the mean function with the nullable integer data type (Int64). This discrepancy is observed in the expected output from the GitHub issue, where the mean operation is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the mean operation needs to be handled differently for the nullable integer data type. One approach to fix the bug would be to check for the data type before performing the mean operation and handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and how == 'mean':
            result = np.mean(block.values, axis=1).reshape(1, -1)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the data type before performing the mean operation. If the data type is integer and the operation is mean, we directly use np.mean to calculate the mean, otherwise we use the grouper to perform the aggregation.

This approach will handle the mean operation differently for the nullable integer data type and will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
