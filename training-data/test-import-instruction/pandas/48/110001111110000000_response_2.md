The problem arising in the failing test seems to be related to data type casting issues. The values in the `values` dictionary are being cast to `Int64` data type, but some operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function are causing issues with casting float64 to int64.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.internals.construction import _stringify_path

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate().apply('get_numeric_data', axis=1)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    agg_items = np.array([], dtype=int)
    no_result = object()

    for idx, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        objs = self._get_result_for_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        
        if objs.empty:
            continue
        
        resulting_obj = pd.concat(objs, axis=1)
        resulting_block = pd.Series(resulting_obj.to_numpy(dtype='float64'), name=idx)

        agg_blocks.append(resulting_block)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_items = np.append(agg_items, locs)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Resetting the index
    indexer = pd.Index(np.sort(agg_items)).get_indexer(agg_items)
    for blk, item in zip(agg_blocks, new_items):
        loc = len(blk)
        blk.index = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _get_result_for_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    result = pd.Series()
    locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

    try:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    except NotImplementedError:
        if alt is None:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
        else:
            result = block.values.agg(alt)

    return result
```

I made an assumption here by re-implementing a `_get_result_for_block` method, which encapsulates the logic that previously existed inside the loop in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. The loop in `_cython_agg_blocks` only appends block results to `agg_blocks` and manages the index using `new_items`, thus potentially reducing the complexity of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

I also utilized more pandas-specific methods such as `apply`, `concat`, `to_numpy`, and `pd.Series` to simplify the logic and avoid issues related to data type casting.

Please note that while attempting to fix the function, I made assumptions based on the provided source code and the failing tests. It's important to thoroughly test and validate the fixed version within the context of the larger codebase to ensure the correctness of the changes.
