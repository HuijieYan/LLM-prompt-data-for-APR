1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is intended to perform aggregation on blocks of data. However, there are several potential error locations within the function.

2. The potential error locations in the function include the handling of exceptions in the try-except blocks, the management of split blocks, and the adjustment of indices when items are removed.

3. The bug may be caused by inadequate handling of exceptions in the try-except blocks, which could lead to incorrect aggregation or exclusion of blocks. Additionally, the management of split blocks and the adjustment of indices when items are removed may not be handled correctly, leading to errors in the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include improving the exception handling within the try-except blocks, revising the logic for managing split blocks, and ensuring proper adjustment of indices when items are removed.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                split = len(result._data.blocks) != 1
                if split:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the exception handling has been revised to ensure proper aggregation and handling of split blocks. Additionally, the adjustment of indices when items are removed has been improved to avoid errors in the output.
