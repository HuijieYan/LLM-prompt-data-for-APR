1. The buggy function is the 'pivot' function located in the pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py file. In the GitHub issue, it is mentioned that the error message raised when 'columns=None' in df.pivot is wrong. The issue arises from the fact that the documentation for the pivot function states that 'index' and 'values' can be optional, but 'columns' is not, however, the error message does not reflect this.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checking if 'values' is None. If it is, the function sets 'cols' based on the values of 'index' and 'columns', but it does not handle the case where 'columns' is None.

3. The bug's cause is that when 'columns' is None, the function should raise an error indicating that 'columns' is not optional based on the documentation, but instead, it raises a KeyError which does not accurately convey the issue.

4. To fix the bug, it could be approached by adding a check to raise an error when 'columns' is None, referencing the documentation that specifies that 'columns' is not optional. Additionally, the error message should be updated to reflect this specific issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'pivot' function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise ValueError("Argument 'columns' is not optional in the pivot function")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected code includes a check for when 'columns' is None and raises a ValueError indicating that 'columns' is not optional. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub post and aligns with the documentation.
