1. The buggy function is a pivot function found in the pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py file. The failing test is located in the pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py file. The error message indicates a KeyError when the pivot function is called with index="col1" and values="col3".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely where the index is being specified as None, and then the MultiIndex.from_arrays function is being used. This is likely where the KeyError is being raised.

3. The bug's cause is that when the index is set to None, it is not handled correctly when the MultiIndex.from_arrays function is called. This leads to a KeyError being raised when the pivot function is executed with certain parameters.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking if the index is not None before using it to create a MultiIndex. Additionally, handling the case where the index is set to None more gracefully would likely resolve the issue.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        if index is not None:  # Check if index is not None
            index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
        else:
            index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([data.index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test that was described.
