1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The GitHub issue is related to converting categorical series back into an integer column, which results in NaN being converted to an unexpected negative value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks the dtype of the input and performs the conversion. The issue might be related to how NaN values are handled during the conversion process.

3. The buggy function checks the dtype of the input array and then handles different cases based on the dtype. It ensures that the conversion is nan-safe when dealing with datetime and timedelta objects. However, it seems that the handling of NaN values for categorical data might be incorrect based on the GitHub issue. The issue description indicates that the conversion of NaN values from a categorical data type to an integer type results in unexpected negative values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include revisiting the handling of NaN values specifically for categorical data types within the `astype_nansafe` function. Additionally, ensuring that the conversion process for different data types aligns with the expected behavior, especially when dealing with NaN values, is important.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function based on the GitHub issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if dtype.kind == "f":
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        elif dtype.kind in ['i', 'u']:
            return arr.astype(dtype, errors='ignore')
        elif dtype.name in ["Int8", "Int16", "Int32", "Int64"]:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a categorical from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, specific handling for categorical data types is added. If the input array is of a categorical data type, it checks the dtype for the desired output and performs the conversion accordingly. This approach aligns with the expected behavior of the conversion and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
