The buggy function is `astype_nansafe` which is intended to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is designed to check if the function raises a ValueError when the input array contains not-a-time (NaT) values and the desired dtype is np.int64.

The potential error location in the problematic function could be when checking for NaN values and attempting to convert timestamp values to integers.

The bug is likely caused because the function does not handle NaT values when the desired dtype is np.int64.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check for NaN values and raise a ValueError when it encounters them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # existing code remains the same

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # remaining existing code

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this correction, the function explicitly checks for NaT values when the desired dtype is np.int64 and raises a ValueError if it encounters them. This change should make the function pass the failing test and handle NaN values appropriately.
