Potential error location: The error message indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found while trying to get the indexer in the buggy function.

Bug's cause: The bug appears to be related to the way the indexer is being accessed or retrieved within the get_indexer function. It seems that there might be an issue with the type signature or the way the indexer is being retrieved for the target values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the signature of the get_indexer function and ensure that it matches the expected type of the target values.
2. Verify the way the indexer is being accessed and make sure it aligns with the expected behavior for IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex values.
3. If necessary, handle the IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex values differently to ensure that the proper indexer is retrieved.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index._codes)
    else:
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a separate condition to handle the case of CategoricalIndex values. For CategoricalIndex, we use the internal codes to get the indexer using the _engine. This should handle the type mismatch issue and ensure that the correct indexer is retrieved for both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex values. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the type error issue reported in the GitHub bug.
