1. The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This class is an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. The function is used to get the indexer for the target array. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` and the subsequent block of code. This is where the bug is likely to be located as it checks for overlapping indices and raises an error if they are found.

3. The cause of the bug could be that the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is not being properly evaluated, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent code block. The `is_overlapping` attribute appears to be a method rather than an attribute, which could be the cause of the issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the implementation of the `is_overlapping` method to ensure it correctly determines if there are overlapping indices.
   - Adjusting the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to properly evaluate the result of the `is_overlapping` method.
   - Reviewing the logic for handling overlapping indices and ensuring it correctly handles the scenario.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The corrected function get_indexer
# Updated the is_overlapping attribute to call the method and added parentheses for correct method calling

@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected the is_overlapping attribute to method call
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` attribute is updated to call the method by adding parentheses for correct method calling. This should fix the bug related to `is_overlapping` evaluation and ensure that the condition is properly handled.
