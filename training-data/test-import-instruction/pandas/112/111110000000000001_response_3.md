1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a member of the `IntervalIndex` class. This class contains the definitions for several methods and attributes, and the `get_indexer` function is one of them.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if self.is_overlapping`. This condition is not properly checking the `is_overlapping` attribute and may lead to incorrect behavior.

3. The potential bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` attribute within the `get_indexer` function. The `is_overlapping` attribute is not a property, and it seems to be intended to be a method. As a result, the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is not correctly checking if the index intervals are overlapping.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Checking the implementation of the `is_overlapping` method and correcting it if necessary.
   b. Changing the `is_overlapping` attribute to a property or using a different approach to check for overlapping intervals.
   c. Ensuring that the `get_indexer` function is calling the correct method to check for overlapping intervals.

5. Corrected code:

```python
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # other methods and attributes...

    # corrected get_indexer function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        # Correct usage of a method to check for overlapping intervals
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # rest of the function remains the same...

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` condition is corrected by calling the method `is_overlapping()` instead of accessing it as an attribute. This ensures that the correct logic for checking overlapping intervals is executed.
