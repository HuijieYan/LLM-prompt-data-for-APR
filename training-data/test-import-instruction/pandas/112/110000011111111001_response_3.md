The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to the handling of the `target_as_index` variable, specifically with respect to the `IntervalIndex` dtype. The error message from the failing test indicates a problem with the signature for the `get_indexer` method, which suggests an issue with the method parameters or the data type being passed to it.

The failing test uses a DataFrame with columns of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an interval range. When calling the `round` method on the DataFrame, the error occurs. This suggests that the bug is likely related to the handling of interval categorical columns in the `get_indexer` function.

Upon analysis of the problematic function, particularly the `get_indexer` method, it appears that the bug is causing a TypeError when trying to access `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the `target_as_index` object or its `values` attribute.

The provided debug output for the `target_as_index` variable also indicates that the `values` attribute is of type `IntervalArray`, which might be causing the TypeError. The `get_indexer` method may not be able to handle this data type properly.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should be modified to handle `IntervalArray` data types correctly and possibly provide an alternative implementation specific to this data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalArray):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.data)
    else:
        # Rest of the original implementation
        # ...
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By specifically handling `IntervalArray` objects and calling `self._engine.get_indexer` with `target_as_index.data`, which bypasses any potential issues with the `values` attribute of `IntervalArray`, we can address the TypeError and ensure that the function can handle interval categorical columns properly. This should allow the fixed function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
