The issue with the given function seems to be that the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is not checking the value of `self.is_overlapping` correctly. Instead of checking the boolean value, it is only checking if the attribute exists. 

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping` by adding parentheses and calling it as a method `self.is_overlapping()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping` and execute the correct logic based on its value.
