The problem occurs in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a "TypeError: No matching signature found" when trying to execute `df.round()` on a DataFrame `df` with columns being a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug likely arises from the implementation of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is failing to handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex properly, leading to the TypeError when executing `df.round()`.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be modified to properly handle the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It seems that there may be an issue with the type of data being handled.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function should handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly, allowing it to work with the `round` method on the DataFrame `df`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        return target_as_index.get_indexer(self)

    # Rest of the code for handling other cases...
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` function now checks if the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex`, and if so, it calls the `get_indexer` method of `CategoricalIndex` to handle the IntervalIndex properly.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the `round` method work as expected for the specific case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It also addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
