The buggy function is `get_indexer` which is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas library. It is used to obtain an indexer for a target index or array-like elements.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the conditional statement where it checks for `self.is_overlapping`. The condition is written as `if self.is_overlapping:` which will always evaluate to True because it is checking the existence of the method, not its return value.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the case when `self.is_overlapping` is False. Additionally, the function seems to be structured in a way that makes it difficult to follow and understand.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly call the `is_overlapping` method with `self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, the function can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` method is called with `self.is_overlapping()` to obtain its return value and properly handle the condition.
