The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the usage of the `target_as_index` variable. Based on the test failure message, the error seems to be related to a TypeError when using the `get_indexer` method. This suggests that there might be a mismatch in the expected type of `target_as_index.values` and the actual type being passed.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the root cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `target_as_index` variable. The function is expecting `target_as_index` to be an IntervalIndex, but when using `target_as_index.values`, it is not being coerced to the expected type.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that `target_as_index.values` is explicitly converted to the expected type before using it in the `get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same...

        # Fix: ensure target_as_index.values is explicitly converted to IntervalArray
        target_values = ensure_index(target_as_index.values)

        # BUG: Replace this line
        #indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

        # Fix: Use the converted target_values
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_values)

        # rest of the code remains the same...
```

By ensuring that `target_as_index.values` is explicitly converted to the expected type (IntervalArray), the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing test without the TypeError.
