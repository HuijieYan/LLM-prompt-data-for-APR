### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is failing with a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when attempting to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. The function is trying to use the `get_indexer` method from `self._engine`, but it seems to be encountering a type error.

The error message corresponds to the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns`. This test creates a DataFrame with an IntervalIndex and attempts to call the `round` method on it, which leads to a call to the `get_indexer` method that fails.

Looking at the input variables and return variables, it appears that the IntervalIndex-related variables are being passed correctly, but the issue is arising when trying to call the `get_indexer` method from `self._engine`.

The GitHub issue describes the problem well, indicating that the `round` method fails when the columns are a CategoricalIndex with an IntervalIndex.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the issue seems to be that the `get_indexer` method is not implemented properly within the `IntervalIndex` class, leading to a type error when it's being called.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is implemented correctly to handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex with an IntervalIndex. This may involve properly handling the indexing for IntervalIndex data types and ensuring that the `get_indexer` method can handle these cases without encountering type errors.

### Corrected Code
```python
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.indexes.interval import IntervalIndex

# Define the corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)
    else:
        # Convert target to a scalar index
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

# Apply the corrected code to the IntervalIndex class
IntervalIndex.get_indexer = get_indexer
```

This corrected code properly handles the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex with an IntervalIndex. It first checks the type of the target and then uses the appropriate method to get the indexer based on the type of the target variable.

This corrected code should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
