The issue here is that the `get_indexer` method defined in the `IntervalIndex` class is not handling the case where the input target is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing a TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with such columns.

The bug is likely located in the section of the code where it checks the type of the target_as_index variable and tries to handle different scenarios. It seems that the code does not account for the case where target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

Additionally, the GitHub issue provides an example of code where the TypeError occurs, which is helpful in understanding the specific use case that is failing.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to handle the case of a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This can be achieved by adding a conditional branch to handle this specific scenario.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method that should resolve the issue:

```python
# ... (other code remains the same)

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex(target)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected version, we check if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` and if so, we convert it to an `IntervalIndex` before continuing with the rest of the code. This should handle the specific scenario mentioned in the GitHub issue and allow the `round` method to work as expected.
