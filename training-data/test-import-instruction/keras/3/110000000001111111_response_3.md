The potential error location within the problematic function is likely when computing the output masks for the layers. The code currently always returns None for output_masks because the Lambda layer does not support using masks.

The bug is caused by the fact that the output_masks for layers that do not support masks are always returned as None, but the actual expected output_masks should be a list with the same length as the output_tensors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the layer supports masks before calling layer.compute_mask and only include it in the output_masks list if it's supported.
2. If the layer does not support masks, simply append a None to the output_masks list instead of calling layer.compute_mask.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (previous code)

            # Call layer.
            if layer.supports_masking:
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors,
                                       computed_masks))
            else:
                output_masks = [None] * len(computed_tensors)

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors,
                                  output_tensors,
                                  output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this correction, the function will handle layers that do not support masks appropriately, ensuring that the correct output_masks are generated. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
