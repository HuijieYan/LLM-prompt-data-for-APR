The issue seems to be with the incorrect creation of `input_layers` in the `if input_tensors is None` block. The `input_layers` list is never populated with any values, and it's later used in a `zip` operation, resulting in an empty list. 

To fix this issue, we should populate the `input_layers` list with the input layers created in the earlier part of the block. Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Add the newly created input layer to input_layers
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the newly created input layers to the `input_layers` list, we ensure that it's not empty and can be used correctly in the subsequent part of the function. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
