Potential Error Location: The error is occurring due to the assertion failure at line 166 of the _clone_functional_model function in keras/models.py. This means that the output tensor is not being correctly computed, leading to the error.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the model outputs and the creation of new layers and weights during the cloning process. The function is not properly handling layers with multiple inputs and outputs, leading to incorrect computation of the output tensors.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that when cloning a functional model, the function correctly handles layers with multiple inputs and outputs.
2. Properly create new layers and instantiate new weights during the cloning process.

Code Correction:
The corrected version of the _clone_functional_model function is provided below:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape, dtype=layer.input.dtype) for layer in model.layers if layer in model.inputs]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        else:
            # Reuse previously cloned layer.
            new_layer = layer_map[layer]

        # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
        references_input_tensors = layer.input
        computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
        for x in references_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(references_input_tensors):
            # Call layer.
            kwargs = {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            if layer.supports_masking:
                kwargs['mask'] = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
            
            output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(layer.output, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By using this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the issue described in the GitHub report should also be resolved.
