1. The buggy function is _clone_functional_model which is intended to clone a functional Model instance. The failing test is testing the cloning of a functional model with multiple outputs. The error message indicates that the output tensor could not be computed, leading to an assertion error.

The GitHub issue further reveals that the error occurs when using clone_model with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True. It suggests that the issue may be related to the layer's lack of support for masks, leading to incorrect output_masks.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where output_masks are being computed, specifically in the if statement where it checks for the mask support of the layer.

3. The bug is caused by the mishandling of output_masks for layers that do not support masks, leading to an incorrect assertion that the output tensor could not be computed.

   (a) The failing test is attempting to clone a functional model with multiple outputs and then compare the predictions of the original and cloned models.
   
   (b) The error message indicates that the output tensor could not be computed, leading to an assertion error.
   
   (c) The GitHub issue indicates that the error occurs when using clone_model with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True. It suggests that the issue may be related to the layer's lack of support for masks, leading to incorrect output_masks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle layers that do not support masks differently to prevent the incorrect assertion.
   - Ensure that the computation of output_tensors and output_masks is handled appropriately for all types of layers.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
            if mask is None and has_arg(model.get_layer(x.name).call, 'mask'):
                mask = model.get_layer(x.name).compute_mask(tensor, mask)
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ' + str(x))

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code handles the computation of output_tensors and output_masks differently for layers that do not support masks. It also checks for the presence of masks before calling compute_mask to avoid incorrect assertions. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
