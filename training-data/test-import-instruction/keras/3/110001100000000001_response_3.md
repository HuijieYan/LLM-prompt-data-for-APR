The potential error in the given function is likely to be in the section where the input_tensors are created, as well as in the iteration over the nodes and gathering inputs to call the new layer. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of input_tensors, and the potential misuse of the layer, as well as the input tensor and output tensor mappings.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Verify the creation and handling of input_tensors to ensure that they are correctly defined and mapped to the corresponding layers.
2. Check the iteration over the nodes and the gathering of inputs to call the new layer to ensure that the input and output tensors are correctly processed and mapped.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    input_layers = model._input_layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                layer_map[input_layers[i]] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        inputs = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors]
        outputs = [tensor_map[y][0] for y in node.output_tensors]
        new_layer = layer_map[node.outbound_layer]
        new_outputs = new_layer(inputs)
        for x, y in zip(outputs, new_outputs):
            tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of input_tensors and the mapping of input and output tensors have been revised to address the potential errors identified in the original function.
