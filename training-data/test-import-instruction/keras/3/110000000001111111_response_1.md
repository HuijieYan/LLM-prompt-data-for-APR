The buggy function is _clone_functional_model, and it is related to the reported issue on GitHub where the user encounters an error when using clone_model. The issue arises due to the Lambda layer not supporting masks, which causes the output_masks to always be None. This leads to the error "Could not compute output Tensor."

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic where it handles handling layers that do not support masks, particularly in the section where it computes the output masks.

From the GitHub issue and the provided input/output variable information, it is clear that the problem lies in the handling of layers that do not support masks. The function does not properly account for this scenario, leading to the discrepancy in the output_masks, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle layers that do not support masks properly. This can be achieved by checking if the layer supports masking before trying to compute the masks. If the layer does not support masking, the function should skip the mask computation step.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code
            
            # If layer does not support masking, skip mask computation
            if not layer.supports_masking:
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map[node.output_tensors[0]] = (output_tensors[0], None)
                tensor_map[node.output_tensors[1]] = (output_tensors[1], None)
                continue

            # existing code

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the corrected function, it should properly handle layers that do not support masking and compute the output_tensors accordingly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
