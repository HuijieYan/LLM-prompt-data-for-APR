1. The problematic function "_clone_functional_model" is intended to clone a functional Model instance in Keras. The failing test "test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs" creates a model with multiple outputs and then attempts to clone it using the "_clone_functional_model" function. However, the test fails with an AssertionError because it was unable to compute the output of the cloned model.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where the output tensors are computed. The function iterates over every node in the model and attempts to compute the output tensors, but the error indicates that it was unable to compute the output for a specific tensor.

3. The bug is likely caused by an issue in the computation of the output tensors within the "_clone_functional_model" function. It seems that the computation of the output tensors is not handling certain cases properly, leading to the failure of the cloned model to produce the expected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include reviewing the logic for computing the output tensors, ensuring that all input tensors are properly mapped to their corresponding output tensors, and handling different types of layers and input configurations more robustly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function "_clone_functional_model" based on the identified issues:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code remains the same)

    # Updating the computation of the output_tensors and tensor_map
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            for k, v in tensor_map.items():
                if k.name == x.name:
                    output_tensors.append(v[0])
                    break

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the updated code, the function should now properly compute and map the output tensors, addressing the issue raised in the failing test. This should ensure that the cloned model produces the expected output and resolves the previous AssertionError.
