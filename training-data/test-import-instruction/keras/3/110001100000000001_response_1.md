The potential error in the provided function `_clone_functional_model` lies in the section where the function is trying to clone the layers of the original model. It involves iterating over the nodes in the model and attempting to create new instances of the layers. However, this process is error-prone and may result in unexpected behavior due to the complex involvement of layer cloning and input tensor handling.

The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of input tensors, incorrect mapping of tensors, or improper implementation of layer cloning.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
- Ensure proper handling of input tensors and their mapping to the corresponding layers.
- Verify the correctness of the layer cloning process to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure that the weights are properly initialized for the new layers.
- Consider re-implementing the layer cloning process to address any potential issues with the current approach.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_list, has_arg

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Initialize the layer and tensor maps
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Input handling
    input_layers = model._input_layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for original_input_layer, input_tensor in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_input_layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]

    # Cloning layers
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        else:
            new_layer = layer_map[layer]
            if isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
                continue

    # Create the output tensors
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we have simplified the handling of input tensors and the cloning of layers to ensure that the new model is properly created. The input tensors are handled using a list comprehension, and the layer cloning process ensures that new instances of the layers are properly created and added to the layer map.
