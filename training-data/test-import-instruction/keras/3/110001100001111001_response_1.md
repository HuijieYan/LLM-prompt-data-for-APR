1. The buggy function is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the existing ones. It takes a `model` and optional `input_tensors` as input, and returns a new instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior of the original model.

2. The potential error location within the function seems to be in the loop that iterates over every node in the reference model. This loop contains logic for computing the new model's output tensors, and there may be issues with how it handles the input and output tensors, as well as the layers involved.

3. The cause of the bug may stem from the incorrect handling of input and output tensors, as well as the cloning of layers. The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the tensor mappings and computed data might not be correctly updated during the loop iteration.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the input and output tensors are properly mapped and computed during the cloning process.
   - Verifying that the layers are correctly cloned and reused as needed.
   - Updating the tensor and layer mappings consistently throughout the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                input_data = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                output_tensors = layer(input_data, **kwargs)

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we have made changes to the loop that iterates over the nodes in the reference model. We ensure that the input data is correctly passed to the new layers and that the output tensors are properly updated in the `tensor_map`. Additionally, we have removed unnecessary conditions and streamlined the code for clarity and correctness.
