The bug in the function seems to be related to the creation and mapping of input tensors. The `input_layers` list is not being populated correctly, and this is causing issues with the creation of input placeholders. Additionally, there are issues with the creation of new layers and the mapping of tensors within the function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly handle the creation and mapping of input tensors and input layers. This involves ensuring that the `input_layers` list is correctly populated and that the input tensors are properly created and mapped to their corresponding layers.

Another potential issue is the creation of new layers and the mapping of tensors within the loop that iterates over the nodes of the model. These processes need to be handled carefully to ensure that the new layers are properly created and the tensors are correctly mapped.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape) for layer in model.layers]
    for original_layer, input_tensor in zip(model.layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_layer] = input_tensor
        tensor_map[original_layer.input] = input_tensor

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            if layer.input in tensor_map:
                new_layer_input = tensor_map[layer.input]
            else:
                new_layer_input = Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape)
                tensor_map[layer.input] = new_layer_input
            tensor_map[layer.output] = new_layer(new_layer_input)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[output] for output in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
This corrected function ensures that input tensors and layers are properly created and mapped within the function, fixing the issues identified in the original code.
