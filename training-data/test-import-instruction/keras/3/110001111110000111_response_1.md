1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional model in Keras. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is intended to test cloning a functional model with multiple outputs. The error message indicates an issue with computing the output tensor, specifically with the `SwapLayer` that is causing the assertion error. The GitHub issue further explains that the error occurs when using multi_gpu_model with cpu_relocation=True, and it seems to be related to the cloning process.

2. Potential Error Location:
The error seems to arise from the process of computing the output tensors and masks during the cloning process within the `_clone_functional_model` function.

3. Bug's Cause:
(a). The `_clone_functional_model` function is attempting to clone a functional model, but it encounters an issue related to computing the output tensors and masks, which results in an assertion error.
(b). The related functions involved in the cloning process, especially the creation and mapping of layers and tensors, seem to be contributing to the issue.
(c). The failing test attempts to clone a model with multiple outputs, and the error message indicates that the output tensor from `SwapLayer` cannot be computed.
(d). The GitHub issue further explains that the error is related to a layer with multiple outputs and no mask support, causing the issue in the cloning process.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
(a). Modify the cloning process to handle layers with multiple outputs and no mask support.
(b). Ensure that the mapping of layers and tensors during cloning is done accurately and without any assumptions about the layer capabilities.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(reference_input_tensors))
                output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)  # No mask support for layer
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # ... (existing code)

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
This corrected code addresses the issue by ensuring that layers with multiple outputs and no mask support are handled correctly during the cloning process. It also provides default None values for output masks in such cases.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
