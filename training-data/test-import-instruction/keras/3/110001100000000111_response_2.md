1. The function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. It is related to the `clone_model` function in keras.models, which is used to clone a model so that it can be run independently or in parallel.

The GitHub issue highlights an error with `clone_model` when using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`. It specifically mentions an assertion error 'Could not compute output Tensor' and identifies that the issue is related to the `clone_model` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the portion of code where the output masks are being computed. The issue on line 153 in the `clone_model` function mentions that `output_masks` will always be `[None]` due to a particular layer not supporting masks. This points to a potential bug in the computation of output_masks.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for creating a new functional model using newly instantiated weights. The bug is likely related to the computation of output_masks for certain layers.
   (b). The related functions, such as `clone_model` and `multi_gpu_model`, are causing the issue due to the computation of output_masks. The `clone_model` function is supposed to create a clone of the model, but it encounters an assertion error related to output_tensors.
   (c). According to the GitHub issue, the issue occurs because output_masks are always `[None]` due to a specific layer not supporting masks. This leads to the assertion error when trying to compute the output Tensor.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the computation of output_masks to properly handle cases where certain layers do not support masks.
   - Implementing a check to validate if a layer supports masks before attempting to compute the masks.
   - Potentially modifying the layers themselves to support masks, if applicable.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Existing code
    # ... (omitting unchanged code for brevity)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Existing code for recovering the corresponding layer

            # New code to handle output_masks
            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):  # Check if layer supports masks
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
            else:
                output_masks = [None] * len(reference_output_tensors)  # Set to default value if masks not supported

            # Existing code for updating tensor_map

    # Existing code
    # ... (omitting unchanged code for brevity)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to see if a layer supports masks before attempting to compute the masks. If the layer does not support masks, a default value of `None` is used for output_masks. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and resolve the assertion error related to output_tensors.
