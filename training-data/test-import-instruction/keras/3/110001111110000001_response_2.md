1. The buggy function is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance in Keras. The failing test is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, but it results in an assertion error when it tries to compute the output tensors in the cloned model. The error message specifically points to the line where the assertion fails in the `_clone_functional_model` function.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the process where it iterates over every node in the reference model and attempts to compute the output tensors.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the multiple outputs during the cloning process, leading to an issue when trying to compute the output tensors in the cloned model. This could be due to an oversight in mapping the output tensors during the cloning process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Reviewing the process of mapping input and output tensors during cloning to ensure that all the necessary connections are retained.
   b. Debugging the cloning process by inspecting the tensors and their mappings at various stages during the iteration over the reference model.
   c. Ensuring that the cloned model retains the necessary information to compute the output tensors correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output: ' + str(x))
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code includes a validation step to ensure that all model outputs have been properly computed in the cloned model. This should address the issue raised in the failing test.
