The potential error in the function is likely occurring during the cloning of the layers. It seems that the function is not handling the input and output tensors correctly, leading to an incorrect mapping and incorrect computation of output tensors.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of input tensors and their corresponding layers during the cloning process, leading to incorrect mappings and computation of output tensors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that input and output tensors are correctly mapped to their corresponding layers, and that the computation of output tensors is done accurately.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Existing code

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
                layer.build(node.output_shapes)
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                computed_tensors, computed_masks = layer.compute_mask(computed_data)
                
                # Update tensor_map.
                for i, x in enumerate(node.output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (computed_tensors[i], computed_masks[i])

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        if mask:
            output_tensors.append(mask)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we have also added a step to build the layer with the correct output shape before using it. Additionally, we have updated the computation and mapping of output tensors to ensure correctness.
