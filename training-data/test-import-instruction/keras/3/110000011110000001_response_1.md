1. The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights. The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is testing this function but encountering an assertion error, indicating that the output tensor couldn't be computed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how the layers and their connections are being cloned and mapped.

3. The bug is caused by issues in how the layers and tensor mappings are being handled in the `_clone_functional_model` function. Specifically, the code fails to properly handle the cloning and mapping of layers, resulting in an assertion error when computing the model's outputs. This could be due to incorrect handling of input_tensors and their mapping to the original model's layers.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring proper mapping of input tensors to the original model's layers and handling the creation of new layers and weights during cloning.
   - Reviewing the logic for creating and mapping input layers and updating tensor_map to correctly handle the layer cloning and connections.
   - Verifying that the tensor_map is being properly updated and used during the iteration over the model's nodes.

5. Below is the corrected code for `_clone_functional_model`, taking into account the identified issues:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # Create new layers and weights by cloning
    cloned_model = Sequential.from_config(model.get_config())
    cloned_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

    # If input_tensors is provided, use them; else create placeholders
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    
    new_outputs = []
    for layer in cloned_model.layers:
        input_tensors = layer(input_tensors)
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            new_outputs.append(input_tensors)

    new_model = Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=new_outputs)

    return new_model
```

With the corrected code, the function should now correctly clone the functional model and pass the failing test.
