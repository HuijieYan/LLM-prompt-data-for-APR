# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
self.table, value: `'dummy_table'`, type: `str`

self, value: `DummyS3CopyToTable()`, type: `DummyS3CopyToTable`

self.s3_load_path, value: `'s3://bucket/key'`, type: `str`

self.copy, value: `<MagicMock name='copy' id='4449051312'>`, type: `MagicMock`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
path, value: `'s3://bucket/key'`, type: `str`

connection, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect()' id='4449153856'>`, type: `MagicMock`

connection.reset, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().reset' id='4449163872'>`, type: `MagicMock`

cursor, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor()' id='4449181120'>`, type: `MagicMock`

connection.cursor, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().cursor' id='4449165856'>`, type: `MagicMock`

connection.commit, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().commit' id='4449356864'>`, type: `MagicMock`

connection.close, value: `<MagicMock name='RedshiftTarget().connect().close' id='4449393392'>`, type: `MagicMock`






# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
S3CopyToTable.s3_load_path TypeError
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
I encountered this TypeError when subclassing S3CopyToTable:
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/kian/workspaces/contrib/luigi/luigi/worker.py", line 137, in run
    new_deps = self._run_get_new_deps()
  File "/home/kian/workspaces/contrib/luigi/luigi/worker.py", line 88, in _run_get_new_deps
    task_gen = self.task.run()
  File "/home/kian/workspaces/contrib/luigi/luigi/contrib/redshift.py", line 166, in run
    path = self.s3_load_path()
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
INFO: Skipping error email. Set `error-email` in the `core` section of the luigi config file to receive error emails.

INFO: Worker Worker(salt=532581476, workers=1, host=..., username=kian, pid=23435) was stopped. Shutting down Keep-Alive thread

which was fixed by changing https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/redshift.py#L166 from:
path = self.s3_load_path()

to
path = self.s3_load_path

(I submitted this fix as PR #996)

as per the other class properties, which as far as i can tell, aren't explicitly referenced as methods either (otherwise they too would raise the above exception?).

The snippet I used to generate the above error:
import luigi

from luigi.s3 import S3Target, S3Client                                                                          
from luigi.contrib.redshift import S3CopyToTable                                                                 


class MyS3Task(luigi.Task): 
    local_tsv = luigi.Parameter()
    s3_load_path = luigi.Parameter()                                                                             
    client = luigi.Parameter()

    def output(self):
        return S3Target(self.s3_load_path, client=self.client)

    def run(self):
        self.client.put(self.local_tsv, self.output().path)
        return


class MyRedshiftTask(S3CopyToTable):
    host = luigi.Parameter()
    database = luigi.Parameter()
    user = luigi.Parameter()
    password = luigi.Parameter()
    table = luigi.Parameter()
    local_tsv = luigi.Parameter()

    aws_access_key_id = luigi.Parameter()
    aws_secret_access_key = luigi.Parameter()

    columns = [("x", "INT"),
               ("y", "INT")]

    s3_load_path = luigi.Parameter()
    copy_options = "IGNOREHEADER 1"

    def requires(self):
        client = S3Client(self.aws_access_key_id, self.aws_secret_access_key)
        return MyS3Task(s3_load_path=self.s3_load_path,
                        local_tsv=self.local_tsv, client=client)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    luigi.run()

which was run from the command line using:
python ./luigi_example.py --local-scheduler MyRedshiftTask \
    --host "<REDSHIFT ENDPOINT>:5439" \
    --database "dev" \
    --user "<USERNAME>" \
    --password "<HIDDEN>" \
    --table "test_redshift_table_5439" \
    --aws-access-key-id "<HIDDEN>" \
    --aws-secret-access-key "<HIDDEN>" \
    --s3-load-path "s3://bucket-5439/test.tsv" \
    --local-tsv "./test.tsv" \

where test.tsv (tab-separated values) contained:
x   y
1   2
10  20
100 200
```
