1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, related functions, test code and corresponding error message, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The buggy class
   (c). The related functions
   (d). The failing test and error message

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a). Passes the failing test
