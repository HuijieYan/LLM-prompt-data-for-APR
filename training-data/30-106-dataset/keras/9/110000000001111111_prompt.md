# Runtime value and type of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the value and type of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

## Case 1
### Runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function
docstring, value: `'Base class for recurrent layers.\n\n    # Arguments\n        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output\n            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.\n        return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state\n            in addition to the output.\n    '`, type: `str`

starting_point, value: `50`, type: `int`

section_end, value: `-1`, type: `int`

marker, value: `'$Arguments$'`, type: `str`

leading_spaces, value: `4`, type: `int`

### Runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
ending_point, value: `-1`, type: `int`

docstring, value: `'Base class for recurrent layers.\n\n    # Arguments\n$Arguments$ '`, type: `str`

block, value: `'- __return_sequences__: Boolean. Whether to return the last output\n    in the output sequence, or the full sequence.\n- __return_state__: Boolean. Whether to return the last state\n    in addition to the output.\n   '`, type: `str`

docstring_slice, value: `'$Arguments$'`, type: `str`

lines, value: `['- __return_sequences__: Boolean. Whether to return the last output', '    in the output sequence, or the full sequence.', '- __return_state__: Boolean. Whether to return the last state', '    in addition to the output.', '   ']`, type: `list`

line, value: `'   '`, type: `str`

top_level_regex, value: `'^    ([^\\s\\\\\\(]+):(.*)'`, type: `str`

top_level_replacement, value: `'- __\\1__:\\2'`, type: `str`

indent, value: `0`, type: `int`

text_block, value: `False`, type: `bool`

i, value: `4`, type: `int`



# Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution
Each case below includes input parameter value and type, and the expected value and type of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. A corrected function must satisfy all these cases.

## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
docstring, value: `'Base class for recurrent layers.\n\n    # Arguments\n        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output\n            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.\n        return_state: Boolean.

section_end, value: `-1`, type: `int`

marker, value: `'$Arguments$'`, type: `str`

leading_spaces, value: `4`, type: `int`

### Expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return
ending_point, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Callbacks documentation not showing bullet points correctly
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
The current documentation on callbacks isn't showing bullet points correctly under the "Arguments" section of a few models. Here's the example for ModelCheckpoint:

filepath: string, path to save the model file. monitor: quantity to monitor. verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1. save_best_only: if save_best_only=True, the latest best model according to the quantity monitored will not be overwritten. mode: one of {auto, min, max}. If save_best_only=True, the decision to overwrite the current save file is made based on either the maximization or the minimization of the monitored quantity. For val_acc, this should be max, for val_loss this should be min, etc. In auto mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. save_weights_only: if True, then only the model's weights will be saved (model.save_weights(filepath)), else the full model is saved (model.save(filepath)). period: Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints.

Looking at the source code, the docstring seems to be organized correctly:
keras/keras/callbacks.py

Lines 371 to 390 in dc9e510

     # Arguments 
         filepath: string, path to save the model file. 
         monitor: quantity to monitor. 
         verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1. 
         save_best_only: if `save_best_only=True`, 
             the latest best model according to 
             the quantity monitored will not be overwritten. 
         mode: one of {auto, min, max}. 
             If `save_best_only=True`, the decision 
             to overwrite the current save file is made 
             based on either the maximization or the 
             minimization of the monitored quantity. For `val_acc`, 
             this should be `max`, for `val_loss` this should 
             be `min`, etc. In `auto` mode, the direction is 
             automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. 
         save_weights_only: if True, then only the model's weights will be 
             saved (`model.save_weights(filepath)`), else the full model 
             is saved (`model.save(filepath)`). 
         period: Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints. 
     """ 
It is however showing up correctly for other models, e.g. ProgbarLogger:

Arguments
count_mode: One of "steps" or "samples". Whether the progress bar should count samples seen or steps (batches) seen.
stateful_metrics: Iterable of string names of metrics that should not be averaged over an epoch. Metrics in this list will be logged as-is. All others will be averaged over time (e.g. loss, etc).
