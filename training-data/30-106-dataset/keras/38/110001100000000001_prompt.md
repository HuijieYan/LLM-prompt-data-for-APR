1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the related functions, .
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The related functions

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code
