Useful Facts:
1. The pivot function is expecting the 'columns' argument to be provided, but it is not raising a clear error message when 'columns' is set to None.
2. The failing test case shows an example where df.pivot(columns=None) is called and expects a specific TypeError message, indicating that 'columns' is a required argument.
3. The error message being raised is confusing and does not clearly indicate that 'columns' is a required argument.
4. The error message mentions a KeyError related to 'None', which does not provide helpful information about the missing 'columns' argument.
5. The bug is documented as raising a wrong error message and not clearly indicating that 'columns' is a required argument.
