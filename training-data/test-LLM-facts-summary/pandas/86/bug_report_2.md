Useful facts to fix the bug:

1. The error message is misleading and confusing, as it indicates that 'None' is not in the columns, when in fact the issue is that the 'columns' argument is not provided.
2. The pivot function's docstring indicates that 'index' and 'values' can be optional, but 'columns' is not optional.
3. The failing test function 'test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error' is specifically designed to test the behavior when 'columns' is not provided, and it expects a clear error message stating that 'columns' is a required argument.
4. The expected behavior for the pivot function should be to raise a TypeError with a message stating that 'columns' is a required argument when it is not provided.
