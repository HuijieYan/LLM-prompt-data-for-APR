Useful Facts:
1. The intended behavior specified in the pandas documentation is that the 'columns' parameter in df.pivot is mandatory, while 'index' and 'values' are optional.
2. The current error message being raised when 'columns' is not provided is confusing and does not accurately reflect the requirement for the 'columns' parameter.
3. The failing test case 'test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error' clearly demonstrates the issue when 'columns' is not provided in the pivot function, and a TypeError with an incorrect error message is raised.
4. The failing test case shows that the error message raised is "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'", instead of raising an error indicating that 'columns' is required and cannot be None.
