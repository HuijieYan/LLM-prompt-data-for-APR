Useful facts:

1. The error message being raised is confusing and leads to a KeyError, rather than explicitly stating that 'columns' is a required argument for the pivot function.
2. The pivot function has the option for 'index' and 'values' to be optional, but 'columns' is not optional according to the docstring.
3. The failing test case is specifically checking for the error message when 'columns' is not provided to the pivot function, and it expects a TypeError with a specific message to be raised.
