Useful Facts:
1. The error message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'" is being raised when calling df.pivot with columns=None.
2. The expected behavior is that columns should not be optional, and an error message indicating this should be raised.
3. The docstring for pivot indicates that index and values can be optional, but columns is not.
