Useful facts to include in the bug report:

1. The failing test is producing a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` due to the ambiguous time at midnight on the clock change day in Cuba (2018-11-04). The issue seems to be related to how the time is being handled during grouping.

2. The input parameter `freq` for the `TimeGrouper` class is `<Day>`, and the `closed` attribute is set to `'left'`. This setup might be contributing to the handling of the ambiguous time.

3. The `self.base` attribute is set to `0`, which might affect the generation of bin edges and the subsequent grouping.

4. The `adjust_bin_edges` function from the same class is called by the buggy function, and it might be relevant to investigate its effect on the grouping behavior, especially regarding the handling of ambiguous times.

5. The relevant variables at the buggy function's return provide information about the computed labels, bin edges, and bins, which are used in the grouping process. The actual bin labels and their relationship to the ambiguous time at midnight on the clock change day should be examined.


These facts can help your colleague understand the context of the bug and make targeted changes to fix the issue.
