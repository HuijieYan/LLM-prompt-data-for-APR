Useful facts for bug report:
1. The error is an AmbiguousTimeError on the call to groupby in the failing test.
2. The input frequency is set to '1D', which means the grouping is by the day.
3. The failing test is running on pandas version 0.24.2.
4. The failing test involves a time zone change related to the daylight saving time (DST) on November 4th, which makes midnight an ambiguous timestamp.
5. The input time index contains ambiguous timestamps due to the time zone change.

Note: The remaining facts regarding the runtime values and types of various variables may be useful for debugging the bug, but they are too specific for inclusion in the bug report.
