Useful Facts to fix the bug:
1. The failing test involves a DateTimeIndex with an ambiguous timestamp on November 4th, due to a clock change in Cuba.
2. The issue arises when attempting to group the data with a daily frequency using pd.Grouper.
3. The test is raised as a result of the pd.Grouper not handling ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.
4. The expected output is for the call to groupby to return three groups, one for each day, including November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, with specific labeling for the group corresponding to November 4th.

These facts indicate that the bug is related to handling ambiguous timestamps during grouping with daily frequency, specifically pertaining to the handling of ambiguous timestamps during a clock change. The fix should focus on addressing this specific scenario to ensure proper handling of ambiguous timestamps in the context of daily frequency grouping.
