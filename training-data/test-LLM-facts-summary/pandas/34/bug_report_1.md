Useful Facts:
1. The input parameter `ax` is a DatetimeIndex with ambiguous local times due to a clock change in Cuba on 2018-11-04, which can cause the AmbiguousTimeError.
2. The groupby call raises an AmbiguousTimeError due to the ambiguous timestamps caused by the clock change in Cuba. This occurs on days with midnight local time.
3. The `freq` parameter of the TimeGrouper is set to `<Day>`, representing daily frequency, and the `closed` parameter is set to `'left'`.
4. The expected output is for the call to groupby to return three groups, one for each day, with the 4th of November labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and containing the 25 hourly data points for that day.
5. It may be relevant to consider the behavior on days with ambiguous timestamps when the `closed` parameter is set to `'left'`, using GMT -4 as the base timezone.
6. The self.freq parameter is set as `<Day>`, representing a frequency of one day. This plays a role in the binning process.
7. The timezone for the 'America/Havana' location uses daylight saving time (DST), which can contribute to the ambiguity in timestamps.
8. The `labels` and `binner` variables are constructed based on `date_range`, which is part of the function's logic involved in creating time bins.
9. The `labels` created by the function should correspond to the start of the day local time, and unexpected labels could cause the AmbiguousTimeError.
