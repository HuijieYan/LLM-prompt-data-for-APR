Useful facts to include in the bug report:

1. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an AmbiguousTimeError: "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times."

2. The input parameter ax is a DatetimeIndex with timezone information and contains dates before and after the clock change in Cuba (2018-11-04).

3. The function is attempting to create bins and labels for the given DatetimeIndex based on the frequency and timezone information.

4. It is important to note that the timezone of the input parameter ax is 'America/Havana', which is a timezone with daylight saving time (DST), and the failing test specifically revolves around the transition from standard time to DST.

5. The use of closed='left' and label='left' in the TimeGrouper class indicates that the leftmost edge of each bin will be used as the end belonging to that bin.

6. The binner and labels variables, which will be used to generate the bins, are created using date_range with a specified frequency, start, end, and timezone information.

7. The presence of an ambiguous timestamp at midnight local time on the clock-change day in Cuba seems to be causing the issue, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError during the generation of bins and labels.

8. The adjusted bin edges are calculated using the input binner and ax_values, and there is a condition to adjust the labels in case there are more labels than bins.

9. The return values of the function include the binner (bins), bins, and labels, indicating that the issue might arise during the creation or alignment of these values.

10. The failing test case uses a call to groupby with a frequency of "1D" to group the data into daily intervals, and it expects the groups to be created without any AmbiguousTimeError.

Including these facts will provide a clear understanding of the issue and help in fixing the bug effectively.
