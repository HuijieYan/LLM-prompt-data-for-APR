Useful facts to include in the bug report to help fix the bug:

1. The error message from the failing test indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised and the message is "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times." This error occurs when handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days.

2. It is important to note that this bug is related to handling time intervals on clock change days, such as the long clock-change day in Cuba, when daylight saving time is observed.

3. The result from the failing test indicates that the groupby call should return three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), with specific labels and corresponding data points. However, the bug causes an incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

4. The input parameters for the buggy function include a DatetimeIndex object for `ax`, with a specific time zone (America/Havana).

5. The variables `first` and `last` contain timestamps, and the variable `binner` is supposed to represent bin edges or labels, along with the `labels` variable.

6. The `ax_values` variable holds an array of timestamps, and `bin_edges` corresponds to the adjusted bin edges for creating the time bins.

7. The `bins` variable represents the generated bins based on the input parameters and the adjusted bin edges.

8. The code is using a 'left' closed interval parameter for the binning process.

9. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the transition at midnight local time on the day of the time change in Cuba, specifically in relation to the ambiguous timestamps that occur on that day.

10. The failure occurs when trying to group the data by daily frequency, leading to an incorrect labeling and handling of the ambiguous timestamp, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.
