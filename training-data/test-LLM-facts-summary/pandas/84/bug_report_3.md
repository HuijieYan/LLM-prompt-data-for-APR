Based on the provided information, here are the useful facts for fixing the bug:

1. The `unstack` function is called as part of the failing test, triggering the error related to the `_get_level_number` method of `MultiIndex`.
2. The bug presents itself during the operation of the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the iterative comprehension section where `clocs` is modified.
3. The errors are due to the use of tuple names in the MultiIndex.
4. The issue is related to the handling of hierarchical columns in the `_unstack_multiple` function.
5. The function is supposed to handle multiple levels of the MultiIndex, but it fails to do so due to KeyError and ValueError issues.

These facts should provide insight into the issue and guide in fixing the bug.
