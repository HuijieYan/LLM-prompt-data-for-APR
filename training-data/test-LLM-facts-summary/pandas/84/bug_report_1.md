Based on the bug report and the provided information, here are some useful facts to help fix the bug:

1. The error occurs when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names, such as `('A', 'a')`.
2. The function `_unstack_multiple` fails when obtaining level numbers with the `index._get_level_number` method.
3. The failing test cases provide specific examples of input data and the expected output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the way the level numbers are handled for MultiIndexes with tuple names.
