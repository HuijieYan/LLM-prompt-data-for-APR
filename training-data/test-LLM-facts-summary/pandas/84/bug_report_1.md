Based on the given information, here are the useful facts for fixing the bug in the function `_unstack_multiple`:

1. The function `_unstack_multiple` is being called with multiple types of `clocs`:
   - Case 1: `clocs` is a tuple containing a single multi-level index. 
   - Case 2: `clocs` is a tuple containing a multi-level index and a single level index.
   - Case 3: `clocs` is also a tuple containing a multi-level index and a single level index.

2. The failing test highlights that the error occurs when trying to retrieve the level number for the multi-level index. This error is manifested in the KeyError: 'Level not found'.

3. The bug happens during the processing of multi-level indexes, which suggests there might be an issue with indexing or handling multi-level indexes.

4. The expected value and type of the final results are provided, including the correct structure of the `unstacked` DataFrame, new levels, new names, new codes, and new columns.

5. The test cases are clear and comprehensive, covering multiple scenarios with different input combinations.

These facts can guide the debugging and fixing of the issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function.
