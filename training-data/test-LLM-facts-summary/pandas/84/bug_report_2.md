## Useful Facts to Include in the Bug Report
1. The unstack method on a MultiIndex with tuple names is causing a KeyError, with the error message indicating that 'A' is not found.
2. The failure occurs due to the _get_level_number method of the MultiIndex, where the IndexError in turn throws a KeyError when trying to look up the level that is not found.
3. The failing test case involves a MultiIndex from a DataFrame with specific hierarchical column names, and the unstack operation fails to correctly handle these hierarchical columns.
4. The observed outputs and intermediate variables do not match the expected outputs and intermediate variables.
5. The unstacked DataFrame does not have the correct levels, names, or codes for the columns which indicates a failure in properly unstacking the DataFrame with MultiIndex.
