Based on the provided source code, failing test cases, and expected results, here are some useful facts to solve this bug:

1. The error occurs when using tuple names as the input parameter for the `unstack` function.
2. The `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module is raising a `KeyError` when trying to access the level "A".
3. The buggy function, `_unstack_multiple`, uses the `index._get_level_number` method to handle the hierarchical index, which is likely the source of the error.
4. The functionality of the `_unstack_multiple` function should be related to unstacking and restructuring multi-level index data, but it appears to be encountering difficulties with tuple names.

Considering these facts, the bug report should focus on an issue with parsing tuple names when using the `_get_level_number` method in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The report should also recommend a review of this logic to handle tuple names correctly, and potentially involve the `unstack` method from the `reshape.py` module.
