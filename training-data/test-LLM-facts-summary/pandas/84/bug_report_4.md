Based on the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables at the function's return, the bug is likely caused by the following issues in the _unstack_multiple function:

1. Error in identifying the level number when a tuple name is used in a MultiIndex.
2. Incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels, codes, and names.

To fix this bug:
- The _get_level_number function should correctly handle tuple names in MultiIndex and return the correct level number.
- Ensure that the manipulation of MultiIndex levels, codes, and names is done accurately and consistently.

Additionally, the error message in the failing test cases emphasizes the need to handle tuple names properly in MultiIndex when unstacking.

These fixes should address the bug and allow the unstacking operation with tuple names in MultiIndex to work correctly.
