Useful facts for bug report:

1. The test function `test_astype_nansafe` is failing because the buggy function `astype_nansafe` is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.
2. The failing test case involves input parameters with dtype datetime64 and int64, as well as input parameters with dtype timedelta64 and int64.
3. The expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return are provided for the failing test cases. These expectations serve as a guideline for fixing the bug.
4. The bug is related to converting categorical series back into an Int column, where it incorrectly converts NaN to a negative integer value.
5. The pandas version used in the failing test case is 0.25.1, and the Python version used is 3.7.4.
