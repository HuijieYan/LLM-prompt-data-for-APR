Useful Facts to Fix the Bug:

1. The failing test cases involve converting `NaT` values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types to integer arrays, which results in a ValueError due to the inability to convert non-finite values to integer.

2. The function `astype_nansafe` is attempting to convert `NaT` values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types to integer arrays, which is causing the bug.

3. The expected value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return must include correct dtype, dtype.kind, and dtype.name values, as specified in the "Expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution" section.

4. The bug involves incorrect conversion of categorical series back into an Int column, converting NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.

5. The issue involves unexpected conversion of NaN in category to a large negative integer value, instead of NaN in the IntX (nullable integer) or float type.

6. The bug is specific to converting categorical or categorical index containing NaNs to an integer dtype.

7. The bug is reproducible when using the astype method to convert categorical series back into an Int column.

These facts will be helpful in identifying and fixing the bug in the astype_nansafe function.
