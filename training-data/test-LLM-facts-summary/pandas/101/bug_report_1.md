Useful Facts for Bug Fix:

1. The failing test checks for the behavior of the function when trying to convert NaT values to an integer. This indicates that the bug may be related to the handling of NaT values during the casting process.

2. The expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution indicate that the dtype of the input array is being changed to `int64`, and the function is trying to cast NaN values to an integer.

3. The GitHub issue titles and descriptions provide context about how the bug is affecting categorical data conversion to integer type.

These facts can be used to help your colleague understand the specific scenarios causing the bug and address the issue appropriately.
