Useful facts for fixing the bug:

1. The failing test case involves the function `astype_nansafe` being called with an input parameter value of `array(['NaT'], dtype=datetime64)` and `dtype=np.int64`. The expected values and types of relevant variables right before the buggy function's return are:
   - dtype: `dtype('int64')`
   - dtype.kind: `'i'`
   - dtype.name: `'int64'`

2. There is another failing test case involving the function `astype_nansafe`, where it is called with an input parameter value of `array(['NaT'], dtype=timedelta64)` and `dtype=np.int64`. The expected values and types of relevant variables right before the buggy function's return are:
   - dtype: `dtype('int64')`
   - dtype.kind: `'i'`
   - dtype.name: `'int64'`

3. The GitHub issue title for this bug is "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs." The detailed description mentions that the bug causes an incorrect conversion of NaN in category to an unexpected negative integer value.

4. An example provided in the detailed description is of a categorical series being converted back into an integer column, where the NaN is converted to an incorrect negative value.

5. The pandas library version used is 0.25.1.

These facts would be useful for your colleague to understand the bug and fix the `astype_nansafe` function.
