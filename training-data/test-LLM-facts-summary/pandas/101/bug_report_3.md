Useful facts to fix the bug:

1. The failing test cases involve the function `astype_nansafe` being called with a `dtype` of `np.int64` and an input array containing `NaT` values. The function is expected to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer."

2. The `astype_nansafe` function is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

3. The `astype_nansafe` function contains conditional statements for handling different data types, including datetime64 and timedelta64 types.

4. The expected output value and type of relevant variables right before the buggy function's return are provided for both the datetime64 and timedelta64 cases.

5. The failing test is related to the conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype, where NaN values are not handled correctly, leading to unexpected results.

6. There is a GitHub issue titled "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" which describes a similar issue related to the conversion of categorical data to int and the mishandling of NaN values.

7. Another GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" provides a detailed description of the problem, including code samples and expected output, along with the version of pandas being used.

These are the most relevant and useful facts that can help in fixing the bug in the `astype_nansafe` function.
