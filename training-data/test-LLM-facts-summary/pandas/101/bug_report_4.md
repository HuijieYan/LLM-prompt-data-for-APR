# Useful facts for the bug report

1. The failing test case involves an input parameter `arr` with dtype `'datetime64'` and `'timedelta64'`, and an output dtype `'int64'`.
2. The expected behavior is that NaN values in categorical series should convert to NaN in `IntX` (nullable integer) or float.
3. When trying to use `astype('Int8')`, there is an error indicating that the dtype is not understood.
4. The current behavior is converting NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.
5. This bug is related to converting from categorical to int, and it ignores NaNs.
6. The issue also involves casting within `get_indexer_non_unique`, which won't always be possible.
7. The bug is related to the conversion of categorical or categorical index containing NaNs to an integer dtype, leading to unexpected behavior.
8. The bug has passed `black pandas` and has relevant tests added and passed.
9. There is an existing issue #28406 that may be related to this bug.
10. The bug report issue is titled "Don't cast categorical nan to int" and has a detailed description.
