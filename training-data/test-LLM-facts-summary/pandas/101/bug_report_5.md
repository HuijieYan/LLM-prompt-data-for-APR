Useful Facts to Fix the Bug:

1. The failing test cases involve converting NaN values of datetime and timedelta types to an integer, and the function is not behaving as expected in these cases.

2. The expected behavior is to convert NaN to NaN in integer format, rather than converting it to an unexpected negative integer value.

3. The input parameters to the function in the failing test cases include arrays with NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types. The shape and dtype of the arrays are also specified in the expected cases.

4. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of categorical series back into an integer column, where it converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.

5. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function did not raise a ValueError as expected, signifying a problem with exception handling for NaN values.

6. The bug is causing the conversion of Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype to raise an error.

7. The bug is likely related to the handling of NaN values in the astype_nansafe function when converting to integer or floating point types.

Using these facts, the bug report can be refined and better addressed to the colleague for fixing the bug.
