Useful facts for bug fix:
- When is_setter is False, the function is expected to raise a ValueError if the key contains non-integer values for a non-integer index.
- The index values are being cast to float64, and the function is failing for both datetime64 and timedelta64 index values.
- The failing test cases include specific input values and the expected behavior for the buggy function.
- The failing test cases include assertions about the type and value of the result from the function, indicating the expected behavior for the function's return value.
