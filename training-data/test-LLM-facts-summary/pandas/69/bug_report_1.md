Useful facts for fixing the bug:

1. The failing test is testing the behavior when using `ser.at[4]` on a Series with `Float64Index` and datetime/timedelta values.

2. The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`.

3. The `_convert_key` method checks if the input keys match the type of the index and raises a `ValueError` if they do not match.

4. The method tests for whether the index is an integer index and whether the keys are integer indexers.

5. The failing test cases involve using non-integer keys on a `Float64Index` with datetime/timedelta values.

6. The `Series` objects in the failing test contain values that are datetime/timedelta types.

These facts provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and fixing the bug.
