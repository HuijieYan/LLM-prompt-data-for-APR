Useful facts for fixing the bug:
- The bug is affecting the `Float64Index` case.
- The `is_setter` parameter is always `False`.
- The `key` parameter is sometimes a tuple of floats and sometimes a tuple of integers.
- The `self.obj` parameter is a `Series` object with a `datetime64[ns]` index or a `timedelta64[ns]` index.

Based on the facts, the bug seems to be related to how the `_convert_key` function handles integer and non-integer indexes. The bug report could provide a detailed analysis of how the function should handle different index types and types of keys. This would help the colleague fix the bug efficiently.
