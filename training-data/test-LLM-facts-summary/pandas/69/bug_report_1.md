Useful facts to include in the bug report:

1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`.

2. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` reveals that the buggy function is causing errors when working with datetime64 and timedelta64 values.

3. The error message indicates that the bug is related to "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

4. The function `_convert_key` should return values of the same type as the index.

5. The failing test cases and the runtime values prove that the function is not handling different types of indexes and keys properly.

6. The bug seems to affect the behavior of `get_value`, `at`, and `loc`, especially when dealing with floats and integers.

These facts should help the colleague understand the bug and fix it effectively.
