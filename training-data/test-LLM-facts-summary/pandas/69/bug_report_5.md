Useful facts to fix the bug in the _convert_key function:
- The function is trying to ensure that keys match the type of the index to prevent any fallback.
- The function checks for integer and non-integer keys based on the type of the index.
- The function checks for the type of index and keys during get and set operations, using conditions for integer and non-integer types.
- The failing tests involve the use of datetime64 and timedelta64 values with a float64 index.
- The failing tests involve assertions for expected results when using at, loc, and standard bracket indexing methods.

Other relevant information:
- The failing tests reflect cases with a float64 index and datetime64 or timedelta64 values.
- The runtime values of the input parameters show the actual and expected type and value at the time of the failure.
- The expected value and type for the variables at the time of the function's return are provided for the failing test cases to compare against the actual runtime values.

The bug seems to be related to mismatched types in the _convert_key function when handling keys and index types. The failing tests involve datetime64 and timedelta64 values with a float64 index, and the function is likely not handling these cases correctly. The provided expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution will be useful in identifying potential fixes for the bug.
