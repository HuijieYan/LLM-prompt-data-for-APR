# The corrected function code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Float64Index with datetime/timedelta values "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (datetime, pd.Timedelta)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex with datetime/timedelta values "
                "can only have datetime/timedelta indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected function code, we have added checks for the type of index and the type of keys being used. We specifically check for `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex` and ensure that the keys being used are of the appropriate type. If not, we raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message explaining the issue. This should address the bug reported and ensure that the function behaves correctly in the given test cases.
