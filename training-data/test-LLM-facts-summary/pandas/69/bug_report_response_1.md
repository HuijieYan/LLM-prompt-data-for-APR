# The corrected function code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer/non-float "
                    "index can only have non-integer/non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected function code, I have added checks for the type of index (`Float64Index` and `Int64Index`) and modified the conditions to raise `ValueError` based on the type of index and the type of key. This should address the bug and handle different index types and types of keys appropriately.
