Facts for bug report:
- The buggy function is _convert_key() in indexing.py.
- The failing test is in the file test_numeric.py and fails with a ValueError.
- The failing test occurs when the at[] method is being used to access a non-integer value in the index of the series.
- The failing test uses various indexers such as .loc, .iloc, and .at to retrieve values from the series.
- The failing test creates a series with datetime or timedelta values and then converts the index to float64.
- The failing test involves both integer and non-integer indexers.

Expected Values at the buggy function's return:
- For the failing tests, the expected values of the variables right before the function's return should be verified to ensure that they are as expected.
  - Ensure that the variables 'ax' and 'i' in the function return the expected values and types in all cases.

GitHub Issue:
- The bug report can be summarized with the title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value."
- The issue description should highlight that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.
