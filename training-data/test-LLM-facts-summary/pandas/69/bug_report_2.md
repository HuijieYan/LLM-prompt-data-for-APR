Useful Facts:
1. The failing test is related to the conversion of key types in the `_convert_key` function.
2. The input parameter `is_setter` is always `False`.
3. The `self.obj` variable in the failing tests has both datetime and timedelta values, indicating that the function should handle both types correctly.
4. The expected behavior of the buggy function is to handle integer and non-integer indexes properly for both datetime and timedelta data types.
