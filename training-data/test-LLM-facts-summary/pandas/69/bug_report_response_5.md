The corrected function code includes additional conditions to handle the specific cases of a float64 index with datetime64 or timedelta64 values, as well as ensuring the correct type matching for different index and key types. The function checks for the type of index and keys during get and set operations, using conditions for integer and non-integer types as well as the specific cases involving float64, datetime64, and timedelta64 values.
