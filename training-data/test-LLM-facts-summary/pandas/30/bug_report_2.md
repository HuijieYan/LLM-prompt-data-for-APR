Useful facts for fixing the bug:

1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column by coercing objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats.

2. The function first checks for the length of the input data and returns the data and a boolean if parsing was successful. If the data is empty, it returns the input data and False.

3. It then proceeds to check the dtype of the input data. If the dtype is "object", it attempts to convert the data to "int64". If this conversion fails, it catches the exception and continues without giving an error.

4. The function then checks for numbers that are out of range and ignores them. This is done by checking if the input data's dtype is a number, then checking if the values are within a specified range.

5. It then attempts to convert the data to datetime with specified units, "raise" errors, and "continue" looping through different date units if conversion fails.

6. The failing test case involves using the `read_json` function with input "[true, true, false]" and specifying `typ="series"`. The expected output is a Pandas Series of boolean values, but instead, it raises a TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime.

7. The failing test provides the runtime value and type of the input parameters of the buggy function, as well as the expected value and type of variables right before the function's return.

8. The failing test provides details of the error message encountered, which indicates that the issue is related to converting boolean values to datetime.

9. The failing test also provides information about the versions of pandas, numpy, and other relevant libraries being used.

10. The bug has been logged as a GitHub issue with the title "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" and a detailed description of the problem.

Based on these facts, the bug can be fixed by addressing the incorrect conversion of boolean values to datetime and ensuring that the function correctly handles the input data as a Pandas Series of boolean values. Additionally, the fix should maintain consistent behavior across different conversion types specified by `typ`.
