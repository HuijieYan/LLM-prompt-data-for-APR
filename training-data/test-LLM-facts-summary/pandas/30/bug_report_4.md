Useful facts to fix this bug:
- When the input data is of type bool (as in the failing test case), the function should directly return the input 'data' instead of attempting to convert it to a datetime.
- The function should check the type of the input data before attempting to convert it to a datetime.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is trying to convert a boolean type to a datetime, which is causing the TypeError. 
- The bug is occurring when the input data is a Series of boolean values, and the function should handle this case differently to avoid the error.
