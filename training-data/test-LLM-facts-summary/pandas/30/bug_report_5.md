Useful facts for fixing the bug in the _try_convert_to_date function:

1. The input parameter data can contain boolean values.

2. The function is attempting to convert the input data to a date using to_datetime with errors="raise", and the unit specified.

3. The function checks if the data type of the input data is "object" and attempts to convert it to "int64".

4. In the failing test case, the input data is a Series containing boolean values.

5. The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not valid.

6. The expected output for this specific case should be a Series of boolean values, not datetime values.

7. The expected output of the failing test before version 1.0.0 was a Series of datetime values, but after this version, it raises a TypeError due to the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime.

By taking these facts into consideration, the bug can be fixed by updating the function to handle boolean input data separately and return a Series of boolean values as the expected output. Additionally, the code should be adjusted to avoid attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.
