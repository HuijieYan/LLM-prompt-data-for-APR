Useful facts to fix the bug in the _try_convert_to_date function:

1. Data input for the failing test is a Series of boolean values: `0     True, 1     True, 2    False, dtype: bool`

2. The function is trying to convert the boolean Series of values into datetime format, resulting in a TypeError: `<class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime`

3. The function checks if the data dtype is "object" and then tries to convert it to dtype "int64" before converting it to datetime.

4. The function then checks if the data is in range before converting it to datetime, and if not in range, it returns the original data and a boolean False.

5. The expected output for the failing test is a Series of boolean values, not timestamps or an exception.

6. The failing test input for the function includes a string representation of a list of boolean values: "[true, true, false]"

7. The failing test is part of the pandas/io/json/test_pandas.py file.

8. The bug occurs in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file, specifically in the _try_convert_to_date function.

These facts can help in fixing the bug in the _try_convert_to_date function.
