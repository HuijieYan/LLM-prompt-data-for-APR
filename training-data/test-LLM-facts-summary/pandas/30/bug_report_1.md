Useful facts to include in the bug report to the colleague:
1. The failing test is attempting to read a JSON string `"[true, true, false]"` with `typ="series"`.
2. The error message indicates that the TypeError occurs when trying to convert a boolean value to datetime.
3. In Case 1, the input `data` is of type `RangeIndex` and `new_data` is also a `RangeIndex` at the function's return, but the dtype is converted to `int64` and the `in_range` variable contains an array of `False` values. This behavior is unexpected and likely related to the bug.
4. In Case 2, the input `data` is a `Series` of boolean values, and at the function's return, `new_data` is still a `Series` of boolean values. The `date_unit` is 'ns' in this case.
5. The failing test expects the output to be a `Series` of bools, which is the correct behavior.
6. The error occurs since Pandas version 1.0.0, indicating a regression or intentional change in behavior.
7. The bug report should include a GitHub issue with a detailed description, as well as the expected output and the environment information from `pd.show_versions()`.
