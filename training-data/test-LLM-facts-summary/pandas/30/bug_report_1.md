Useful facts that can help fix this bug:
- The function is attempting to convert data into date format using different units, but it is encountering an error when dealing with boolean values.
- The failing test is trying to read a JSON list of boolean values and parse it into a Pandas Series. However, instead of returning a Series of boolean values, it is raising a TypeError, claiming that bool is not convertible to datetime.
- The input parameter 'data' can be either a RangeIndex or a Series, and the function treats it differently based on its type.
- In the failing test, the 'data' input parameter is a Series with boolean values, but the function is coercing the data into integer format and attempting to convert it into datetime, leading to the TypeError.
- The 'new_data' variable, which is supposed to store the processed data, ends up containing the same boolean values as the original 'data' input parameter, indicating that the processing steps in the function did not achieve the intended conversion.
- The function is designed to handle various formats and units for date conversion, but the current implementation is not properly recognizing boolean data and is attempting to apply date conversion logic to it.

These facts can be used to understand the key issues in the function and guide the troubleshooting process.
