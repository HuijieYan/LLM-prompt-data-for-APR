Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the buggy function's return, the bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns. The buggy function appears to be incorrectly handling the case when the `columns` parameter is a tuple representing multi-index columns. 

The buggy behavior is triggered by test cases with multi-index columns. When the `columns` parameter represents multi-index columns, the function encounters an AttributeError. This suggests that the function might not be correctly handling the multi-index columns and is causing errors when trying to access attributes such as `columns` on the result.

The bug report should emphasize the failing test cases involving multi-index columns and the incorrect handling of the `columns` parameter causing an AttributeError. The issue description should outline the discrepancy between the expected behavior (symmetrical handling between rows/columns and single/multi cases) and the actual behavior causing errors. Additionally, it should mention the version of pandas in which the issue was observed.
