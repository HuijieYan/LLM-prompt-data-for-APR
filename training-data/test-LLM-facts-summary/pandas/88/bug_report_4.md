Based on the provided code and runtime values, here are some useful facts to include in the bug report to help your colleague fix the bug:

1. The `pivot_table` function appears to be erroneously returning the result as a Series object in some cases, causing an AttributeError when trying to access `table.columns` (e.g., Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, and Case 4).
2. The buggy behavior seems to occur when using multi-index columns, as illustrated by the failing test. It encounters an AttributeError when attempting to access the columns after the pivot operation.
3. The input parameter `columns` is being properly accepted and processed as a list, but the return type is unexpected. This could point to a problem with the processing logic, causing the function to return incorrect types in some cases.
4. The behavior is inconsistent, as it works as expected in some cases but fails in others, which suggests that the underlying issue may be related to the handling of multi-index columns.

These facts can help your colleague investigate and fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function.
