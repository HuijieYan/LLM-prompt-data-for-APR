Based on the provided source code, runtime values, and failing test cases, here are the useful facts for fixing the bug:

1. The bug occurs when `df.pivot_table()` is used with multi-index columns, resulting in an AttributeError due to a 'Series' object not having the attribute 'columns'.
2. The specific failing scenarios are related to the multi-index use cases of the `pivot_table()` function.
3. The input data frames for the failing tests include columns named as integers and strings, potentially causing issues with the multi-index columns.
4. The error occurs in the section where the function checks `if table.columns.nlevels > 1`, leading to the AttributeError when accessing the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object.
5. The function improperly handles multi-index columns, resulting in unexpected behavior.

These facts can be used to guide the bug fixing process and ensure that the `pivot_table()` function handles multi-index columns correctly.
