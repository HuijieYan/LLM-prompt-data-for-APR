Based on the provided information, here are the useful facts for your bug report:

1. The bug causes an AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns' when calling the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns.

2. The failing tests provide input parameter values, as well as intermediate variable values at the function's return. Analyzing these values will help in identifying why the tests are failing and effectively fix the bug.

3. The bug is observed in the `pivot_table` function when it checks whether `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. The error occurs when this condition is evaluated with multi-index columns.

4. The input `columns` parameter is a tuple, but the resulting `columns` variable inside the function is being converted to a list. This discrepancy in the input vs. the variable transformation might be causing the bug.

5. The function checks for specific conditions related to `values` and `columns`, especially when they are multi-index. These conditions include filtering, applying operations, and indexing the resulting `table`.

6. The `pivot_table` function handles cases with single and multi-index in a different manner, which may be insufficient or incorrect for multi-index columns, leading to the observed error.

7. The provided code samples demonstrate the issue and the expected behavior with different types of input, highlighting the buggy behavior specifically when using multi-index columns.

Please incorporate these facts into your bug report for your colleague to effectively resolve the bug.
