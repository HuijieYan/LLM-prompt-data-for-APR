# Facts to include in the bug report:

1. The function `pivot_table` is being called recursively on line 15, which might cause unexpected behavior due to the recursive nature of these calls.
2. The variable `keys` are derived from input parameters `index` and `columns`, and play a significant role in the rest of the process. The determination of the keys might affect the subsequent aggregation and the creation of the resulting DataFrame.
3. The appropriate handling of multi-index columns seems to be failing, as evidenced by the errors encountered in the failing test cases.
4. The code to discard the top level on line 166 attempts to select a single column when values are passed and no other columns are present. This logic needs to be reviewed to ensure it's functioning correctly.
5. The error indicated an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`, which suggests that the variable `table` might sometimes be a `Series` object when it is expected to be a `DataFrame`. This should be investigated to understand why the expected data type is not being maintained.
6. The recursive call to `pivot_table` might be causing issues due to a lack of proper termination conditions. This might explain why the aggregation does not behave as expected for multi-index columns.
7. The code does not provide an additional break condition or limiting condition for the recursive call, which can lead to unexpected or excessive recursion that compromises the function's execution.
