# Fact 1
The `pivot_table` function is being called recursively within the `pivot_table` function. This recursive call is made when the `aggfunc` parameter is a list.

# Fact 2
The `pivot_table` function involves groupby operations and reorganization of the table based on the provided parameters.

# Fact 3
In the failing tests, the function is being called with different combinations of columns, including single and multi-index columns.

# Fact 4
The error in the failing tests is related to an AttributeError, specifically indicating that 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This suggests that there may be an issue related to how the result is being handled when the columns contain multi-level indexes. 

# Fact 5
In the failing tests, the error occurs after the condition `(table.columns.nlevels > 1)` in the function, indicating that it's related to the presence of multi-level columns in the result.
