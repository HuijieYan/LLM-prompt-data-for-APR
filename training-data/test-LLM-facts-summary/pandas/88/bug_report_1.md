The bug occurs when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns. The error is caused by the function incorrectly handling the presence of multi-index columns, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the columns attribute of a Series object.

Based on the provided source code and failing test cases, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of multi-index columns within the function. The function should correctly handle the presence of multi-index columns and avoid the AttributeError when processing the data.

It is important to further analyze the handling of multi-index columns within the function to identify the root cause of the issue and make the necessary adjustments to handle them appropriately, effectively fixing the bug.
