Based on the provided source code and the runtime values of the variables at the function's return, here are the useful facts to include in the bug report to help fix the bug:

1. The bug occurs when using the `df2.pivot_table(values='v', columns=cols)` syntax, where `cols` is a tuple that specifies multi-index column names. This leads to an attribute error because the function is unable to handle the multi-index columns properly.

2. The main issue seems to stem from the logic around handling multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. The error occurs specifically when trying to access the `columns` attribute on the `table` object.

3. The observed values of `table`, `values`, `index`, and `columns` in the runtime show that the logic for handling multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function may not be properly handling the multi-index structure, leading to unexpected behavior and the attribute error.

4. The logic related to handling multi-index columns, especially when accessing attributes like `columns.nlevels`, should be thoroughly reviewed and potentially modified to fully support multi-index columns without causing errors.

These facts will help in understanding and addressing the bug in the `pivot_table` function.
