Useful facts to fix the bug in the above source code:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` calls several functions from the same class, such as `self._check_method`, `self.is_overlapping`, `self.left`, `self.right`, `self._maybe_convert_i8`, and `self.get_loc`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.
3. The failing test involves using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns of `pd.CategoricalIndex(pd.interval_range(0, 2))`.
4. The failing test provides a sample DataFrame to reproduce the issue, showing that the error occurs when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
5. The description of the bug on GitHub should mention that the `round` method fails whenever the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, with the specific TypeError encountered.
