Useful facts to include in the bug report are:

1. The buggy function calls several other functions from the same class, including `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `left`, `right`, `dtype`, and `_engine`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` at the `get_indexer` function in `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`.
3. The failing test involves creating a DataFrame using `pd.CategoricalIndex` with an `IntervalIndex` as the columns, and then calling the `round` method on the DataFrame, which leads to the failure.
4. The relevant values and types of variables at the function's return include `target_as_index`, `target_as_index.dtype`, `target_as_index.closed`, `target_as_index.left`, `target_as_index.right`, and `target_as_index.values`.

These facts will help provide actionable information to assist in fixing the bug.
