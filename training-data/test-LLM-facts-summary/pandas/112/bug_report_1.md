Useful facts for bug report:

1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is part of the `IntervalIndex` class, which represents an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side.
   
2. The failing test shows that the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

3. The error message from the failing test indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, specifically related to the `get_indexer` function.

4. The runtime values and types of input parameters for the failing test case include `self`, `target`, `self.is_overlapping`, `self.dtype`, `self.closed`, `self.left`, and `self.right`.

5. The runtime values and types of variables before the buggy function's return include `target_as_index`, `target_as_index.dtype`, `target_as_index.closed`, `target_as_index.left`, `target_as_index.right`, and `target_as_index.values`.

6. The failing test includes a specific example involving the `round` method and a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, emphasizing the failure scenario.

7. Since the `IntervalIndex` class contains several relevant methods called by the buggy function, it might be useful to examine these methods to understand their interactions and potential impact on the bug.
