Useful facts to include in the bug report:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` at line 964 of `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` in the `get_indexer` method.
2. The failing test involves a DataFrame `df` with columns created using `pd.CategoricalIndex(pd.interval_range(0, 2))`.
3. The buggy function `get_indexer` calls several methods from the `IntervalIndex` class, such as `is_overlapping`, `ensure_index`, and `find_common_type`, along with methods like `_engine` and `get_loc`.
4. The failing test case includes an `IntervalIndex` with a closed value of `'right'`.
5. The input `target` to `get_indexer` is also an `IntervalIndex` with a closed value of `'right'`.
6. The return value `target_as_index` within `get_indexer` maintains the same closed value and types as the input `target`.
7. The failing test focuses on the `.round()` method, which fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

These facts should provide a clear picture of the bug to help fix it effectively.
