Useful facts to include in the bug report:
1. The failing test involves using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
2. The error message points to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex`.
3. The runtime values and types of input parameters and relevant variables at the function's return are provided, showing the `IntervalIndex` and its attributes involved in the failing test case.
4. The `self.is_overlapping` attribute in the buggy function is shown to have a value of `False`.

These facts can help the colleague understand the context of the bug and provide insights into why the `get_indexer` method is failing when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. Additionally, the GitHub issue title and detailed description provide a clear problem statement for the bug.
