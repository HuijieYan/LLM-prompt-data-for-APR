- The `get_indexer` method calls functions such as `equals`, `left`, `right`, `values`, and `is_overlapping` from the same class.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found" when calling the `_engine.get_indexer` method.
- In Case 1, the `target_as_index` object is an `IntervalIndex` with specific attributes like `dtype`, `closed`, `left`, `right`, and `values`.
