Useful facts for bug report:

1. The bug occurs when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns represented as a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. The failing test case involves a DataFrame with values `[0.66, 1.1], [0.3, 0.25]` and columns represented as a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` generated using `pd.interval_range(0, 2)`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` at `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` in the `get_indexer` function.

Based on these facts, it appears that the issue may be related to how the `get_indexer` function handles the `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`, resulting in the `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on the DataFrame.
