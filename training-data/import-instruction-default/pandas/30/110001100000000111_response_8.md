The buggy function seems to be attempting to convert a given input data into a date column, but instead of returning the original data when the input data is empty, it erroneously returns the original data and a False value. This issue seems to have caused the bug described in the GitHub issue title and detailed description.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
```python
if not len(data):
    return data, False
```
This condition checks if the input data is empty and returns the data and a False value, which is incorrect.

The buggy function is responsible for parsing a ndarray-like input into a date column, and it seems to be causing the incorrect parsing of bool values as timestamps, which is leading to the TypeError described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the input data, particularly when it is empty, and ensure that bool values are not incorrectly parsed as timestamps.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # handle empty input data
    if data.empty:
        return data, True

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should successfully address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
