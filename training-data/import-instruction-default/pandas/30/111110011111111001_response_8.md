The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` does not handle the case where the input data is of type bool, causing a TypeError when trying to convert it to datetime.

The potential error location is within the try-except block that tries to convert the input data to type int64. This operation is not applicable when the input data is of type bool.

The bug is caused by the function not handling the case where the input data is of type bool. This causes a TypeError to be raised when trying to convert bool to datetime.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the input data is of type bool, and handle this case separately. We can simply return the original data along with a False boolean to indicate that the parsing was unsuccessful.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case where the input data is of type bool and return the original data along with a False boolean to indicate that the parsing was unsuccessful. The function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
