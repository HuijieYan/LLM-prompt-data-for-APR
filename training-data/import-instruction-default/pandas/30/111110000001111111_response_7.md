The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be that it always returns the original `data` without converting it to a date, regardless of the logic applied. This results in unexpected behavior when the function is called, as described in the GitHub issue.

The error seems to be located in the conditional checks within the function. The logic for converting the data to a date unit is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect return values.

The expected fix for this bug would involve properly converting the input data to a date unit based on the specified conditions and then returning the converted data along with a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful or not.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the conditional checks and conversion logic to ensure that the input data is correctly converted to a date unit when applicable. Additionally, the function should return both the converted data and a boolean indicating the success or failure of the conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return new_data, False
```

This corrected version addresses the issues observed in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue by properly converting the input data to a date unit when applicable and ensuring that the function returns the converted data along with a boolean indicating the success or failure of the conversion.
