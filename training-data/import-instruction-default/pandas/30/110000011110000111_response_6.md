The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to parse an array-like object into a date column. The problem lies in the fact that when the input data contains boolean values, it attempts to convert them to datetime, which is not a valid operation.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` tries to read a JSON string into a pandas Series, which contains boolean values. The error message indicates that the boolean values are not convertible to datetime, which is the source of the problem.

The GitHub issue also confirms that the expected output should be a Series of boolean values, but instead it results in an exception or a series of timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` needs to check for boolean values in the input data and handle them appropriately, either by converting them to datetime if that's the intention, or by returning a Series of boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function checks for boolean values in the input data and returns them with a status of True, indicating that the conversion was successful. This change ensures that the function handles boolean values in a way that is consistent with the expectations of the test and resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
