The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be caused by an incorrect conversion of the `data` variable to a date. The function is currently attempting to convert the `data` to a date using the `to_datetime` function, which is raising a TypeError because the `data` input variable is not suitable for conversion to datetime.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle the conversion of boolean Series (as seen in the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`) to date in a more appropriate manner.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return new_data, True
```

In this corrected version, we use the `pd.to_datetime` function to convert the `data` to datetime, and we handle errors using the `errors='coerce'` argument. This should allow the boolean Series to be converted to datetime without raising a TypeError.

With this corrected function, the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` should now pass, as it will handle the conversion of boolean values to date appropriately.
