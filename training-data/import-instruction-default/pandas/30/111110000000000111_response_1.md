1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class and is meant to convert a ndarray into a date column. The provided GitHub issue is related to the incorrect conversion of JSON data into a Pandas Series object, which is causing unexpected behavior. The issue is specifically related to the `read_json` function when `typ="series"` is used with a JSON list of bools resulting in timestamps or exceptions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the date conversion logic where the function tries to convert different date formats and coercing objects into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats.

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of boolean values during the date conversion process, leading to unexpected timestamps or exceptions. This can be discerned from the provided GitHub issue, where the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it results in timestamps or exceptions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Identifying and handling boolean values specifically to prevent them from being incorrectly converted to timestamps.
   b. Checking for boolean values before attempting to convert to datetime.
   c. Ensuring that the function only converts the input data to datetime when it is in date format, and does not interfere with non-date formats such as boolean values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            # Handle boolean values
            if 'bool' in str(data.dtype):
                return data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function includes handling for boolean values specifically, and prevents them from being incorrectly converted to datetime. This should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
