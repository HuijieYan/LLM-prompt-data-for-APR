The issue that is being described in GitHub is that when using the `pd.read_json` method to read a JSON list of bools with the `typ="series"` parameter, the expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools, but instead it results in a Series of timestamps. This inconsistency with the "frame" case and the inconsistency between older and newer Pandas versions leads to unexpected behavior and exceptions.

The issue is likely coming from the `_try_convert_to_date` method in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. The method is mistakenly coercing the input data to numeric types and attempting to convert it to dates, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_try_convert_to_date` method to handle boolean input data correctly, and not attempt to convert it to date values. The method should check the type of the input data and return a boolean if it is successful, without attempting to convert the data to dates.

Here is the corrected version of the `try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if isinstance(data, (Series, DataFrame)):
        data = data.squeeze()

    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        return data, False

    return data, True
```

This corrected version of the method will handle boolean input data correctly and return a boolean if it is successful, without attempting to convert the data to dates.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and ensure that the `pd.read_json` method with `typ="series"` parameter returns a Pandas Series of bools as expected.
