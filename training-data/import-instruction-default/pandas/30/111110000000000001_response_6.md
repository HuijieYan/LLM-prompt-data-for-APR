The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if not len(data)` statement. This condition checks if the length of the data is zero and returns the data along with False if true. However, the intention might be to check if the data is empty or contains NaN values. Additionally, there are multiple checks and conversions on the `new_data` variable which can be simplified.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly checking for empty data or NaN values, and the logic for converting `new_data` is complex and can be simplified.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be used:
- Check if the data is empty or contains NaN values using the `np.isnan` function.
- Simplify the logic for converting `new_data` by directly applying `to_datetime` function without multiple checks.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # check for empty or NaN data
        if np.isnan(data).all():
            return data, False
    
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```
