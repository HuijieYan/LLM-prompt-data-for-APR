1. The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date`, which is a method of the `Parser` class in the `_json` module of the `pandas` library. The method tries to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. The related GitHub issue title suggests that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of JSON list of bools results in timestamps or exceptions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of a boolean value to a datetime, which is causing the unexpected behavior.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). Buggy function: The method tries to convert the input data into a date column without considering the input type, leading to unexpected behavior when the input is a JSON list of bools.
   (b). Buggy class: The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing JSON input into a DataFrame or a Series, and it contains the `_try_convert_to_date` method, which is causing the issue.
   (c). Related functions: The `read_json` function with `typ="series"` is related to the issue as it results in unexpected timestamps or exceptions when the input is a JSON list of bools.
   (d). GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue provides a sample of the expected and actual output, as well as information about the installed versions of pandas and related packages, highlighting the inconsistency and unexpected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the input type before attempting to convert it to a date column.
   (b). Handle boolean input separately and return a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them to dates.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if all(isinstance(val, (bool, np.bool_)) for val in new_data):
            # Handle boolean input separately
            return new_data, False
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code includes handling of boolean input separately and returning a Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them to dates. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
