Upon analyzing the buggy function and its runtime input/output variable information, as well as the GitHub issue, the potential error location within the function is identified to be the logic related to date conversion.

The bug is caused due to incorrect parsing and conversion of data that results in the unexpected output of date formats instead of boolean values. The discrepancy between the actual and the expected output variable values is the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, the logic for parsing and converting the input data to date formats needs to be revised to ensure that the expected output of boolean values is achieved as per the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # corrected from data.astype to new_data.astype
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)  # corrected from new_data._values
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The corrected function ensures that the date conversion logic is appropriately handled to return the expected boolean values, as per the GitHub issue.

This corrected function will effectively address the bug and provide the desired output without causing a Type Error.
