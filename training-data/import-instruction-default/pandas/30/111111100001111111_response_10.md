The potential error in the provided function lies in the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime. This leads to an inconsistent behavior when reading JSON with typ="series". The problematic part of the function is the attempt to convert boolean objects into datetime objects, resulting in the TypeError. This behavior is not consistent with other data types or with older versions of pandas.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be adjusted to return a Series of boolean values without attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/io/json/_json.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Parser():

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("bool")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        return new_data, True
```

This corrected function will resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and will return a Series of boolean values when reading JSON with typ="series".
