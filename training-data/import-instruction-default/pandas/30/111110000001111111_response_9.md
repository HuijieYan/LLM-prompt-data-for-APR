The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the attempt to parse a date column in a Pandas DataFrame. The function is trying to coerce object types in epoch/iso formats and integer/float types into epoch formats. However, the logic for checking and converting the data seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior and type conversion errors.

The bug seems to be located in the logic for checking and converting the data type to int64 when the dtype of the data is "object". The logic for checking if numbers are out of range also seems to be problematic.

The input parameter "data" is expected to contain a RangeIndex or a Series object, and the expected output is a processed version of the input data.

The GitHub issue related to this bug indicates that when using the `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` and the input JSON list contains boolean values, the function should return a Pandas Series of boolean values. However, due to the bug, it's attempting to convert the boolean values to a date format, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking and converting the data type should be revisited and corrected. Additionally, the logic for checking if numbers are out of range should be verified and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the input parameters and return the expected output in all the provided cases, fixing the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
