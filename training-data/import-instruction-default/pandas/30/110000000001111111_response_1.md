The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` causes it to incorrectly convert boolean and integer data into datetime format. This bug is also reflected in the GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception."

The bug is located in the section of the code where it checks if the data is of type "object" and attempts to convert it to "int64." This incorrect conversion leads to the misinterpretation of boolean and integer data as timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle boolean and integer data and ensure that it does not mistakenly convert them into datetime format.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle boolean and integer data before attempting to convert it to datetime format. This can be done by checking the data type and performing an appropriate conversion or returning the original data if it is boolean or integer.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for boolean data and returns it immediately if found, instead of attempting to convert it. This will ensure that boolean data is not mistakenly converted into datetime format.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub problem description.
