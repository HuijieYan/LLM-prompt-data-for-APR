The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to stem from incorrect handling of dtype 'object' and np.number values. This is evident from the failing tests, as the new_data.dtype is not being updated correctly in the case of data being a RangeIndex or a Series of bool values. 

The GitHub issue provided suggests that the problem arises when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` to convert a JSON list of bools to a Pandas Series. This results in the function trying to convert the bool values to datetimes, which is incorrect behavior. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the 'object' and np.number data types and that it returns the original data if no conversion to datetime is possible. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype.type == np.object_:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='raise')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            data = new_data
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data)
            | pd.to_datetime(data * 1e9), 
            errors='coerce') > pd.to_datetime(self.min_stamp * 1e9)
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False
    
    return data, False
```
By switching the conversion for 'object' dtypes to use `pd.to_numeric` and fixing the logic for checking if values are in range, the function should behave correctly. This should address the issue described in the GitHub issue as well.
