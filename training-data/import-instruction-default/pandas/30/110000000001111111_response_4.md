The bug in the provided function is likely to be in the logic for checking and converting the data to date format. This is supported by the GitHub issue, which describes an inconsistency in the output when converting JSON data to a Pandas Series.

The function is not handling boolean data correctly and tries to convert it to a date format, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior. This is likely the cause of the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle boolean data and not attempt to convert it to a date format. This will ensure that the output is consistent with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By adding a condition to handle boolean data appropriately, the function will now return the correct output for the input values specified.

This corrected function should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem description and provide the expected output as specified.
