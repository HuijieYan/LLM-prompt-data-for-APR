1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It is responsible for converting a numpy array into a date column in a pandas DataFrame. The GitHub issue indicates that the function is failing to parse a JSON input containing boolean values, resulting in a datetime object instead of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that attempts to parse the input data using the `to_datetime` method. This section is responsible for converting the data into a date column, and it is where the incorrect conversion to datetime is occurring.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is incorrectly converting boolean values into datetime objects, due to the logic within the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Checking the data type of the input and ensuring that boolean values are handled correctly.
   (b). Explicitly casting any boolean values to the boolean type to prevent incorrect conversions.
   (c). Limiting the conversion to datetime to only specific data types that are relevant for date columns.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which should resolve the issue:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype(str).str.strip().str.lower().map({"true": True, "false": False})
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # check if data type is boolean and return if so
        if new_data.dtype == bool:
            return new_data, True
        
        # continue with datetime parsing
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        
        return data, False
```

This corrected function includes the following changes:
- After checking if the data type is an object, the function now attempts to explicitly map strings "true" and "false" to boolean values True and False, respectively.
- If the data type of the input is already boolean, the function immediately returns the input as is, since it's already in the correct format.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, the function proceeds with parsing the input into a date column using the `to_datetime` method.

This corrected code should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and correctly handle boolean values when converting to date columns.
