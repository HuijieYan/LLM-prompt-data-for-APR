The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop where it attempts to convert the data to datetime, and it returns prematurely inside the loop, preventing it from trying all possible date units.

The issue described in the GitHub issue is that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps or an exception, rather than a series of booleans. This is due to a bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date`, which attempts to convert the data to datetime even when it is not necessary.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value is that the function should return the original `data` without attempting to convert it to datetime, as it is not necessary for the case of boolean data.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to check the data type and return the original data without attempting to convert it to datetime if it is not of type 'object', as in the cases of boolean data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype != "object":
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function checks if the data type is not 'object' and returns the original data without attempting to convert it if it's not necessary. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
