1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue because it is responsible for converting data into date columns. The GitHub issue describes a problem where `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps or an exception, instead of a Series of bools.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it tries to convert the data to datetime using `to_datetime` function. This is likely where the conversion to timestamps occurs, causing the unexpected behavior.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is incorrectly converting boolean values to timestamps, resulting in inconsistent behavior with the `typ="frame"` case as described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to ensure that boolean values are not being coerced into timestamps
   - Modifying the data type conversions to handle boolean values differently
   - Ensuring that the function returns a Series of bools when appropriate

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function includes the additional check to return `new_data` without conversion if the data type is boolean. This will ensure that boolean values are not coerced into timestamps, as described in the GitHub issue.
