1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method that tries to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column. The issue on GitHub describes a problem with the `pd.read_json` function when `typ="series"` is used, resulting in a TypeError. The issue seems to be related to the conversion of boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of boolean values. The function seems to be attempting to coerce boolean values into a date format, which is causing the error.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion. This is evident from the error message and the expected output described in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the dtype of the input data and returning a Series of bool if the dtype is boolean.
   - Handling boolean values separately from other data types when converting to datetime.
   - Modifying the function to not attempt to convert boolean values to datetime.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
        
    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, False
    
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check for the data type in the input, and if the data type is boolean, it returns the original data and False. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
