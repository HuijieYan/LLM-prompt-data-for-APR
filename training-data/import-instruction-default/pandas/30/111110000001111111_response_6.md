The bug in the provided function seems to be that it is incorrectly converting non-datetime data into datetime data in certain cases. This is causing the function to fail and is also related to a reported issue on GitHub.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it tries to convert non-datetime data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling non-datetime data and is trying to coerce it into a datetime format, which is causing it to fail and produce unexpected results.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add checks to ensure that the data being converted to datetime is actually in a format that can be converted. This might involve checking the data type before attempting any conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        if new_data.dtype != "int64":
            return data, False

        return new_data, True
```

This corrected code should handle the data conversion more gracefully and avoid errors when trying to convert non-datetime data to datetime.

This function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
