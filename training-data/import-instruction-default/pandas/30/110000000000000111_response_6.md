1. The buggy function is meant to convert data to a date column, but it is encountering issues when dealing with boolean data. The GitHub issue is related to the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` resulting in timestamps or exceptions instead of a series of bools. This indicates a potential problem with the conversion of boolean data to dates.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of boolean data to dates, which is not the intended behavior.

3. The buggy function attempts to convert the input data to a date column, which is not the correct behavior when the input data is boolean. This behavior is related to the GitHub issue, where the `read_json` function is incorrectly converting boolean data to timestamps.

4. To fix the bug, the function should first check the data type of the input. If the input data is boolean, it should return the input data as is and set the parsing success to true. This will ensure that boolean data is not incorrectly converted to dates.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    # Check if the input data is boolean
    if data.dtype == np.bool:
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
The corrected code includes a check for boolean data type at the beginning of the function, and if the input data is boolean, it returns the input data as is with parsing success set to true. This resolves the issue with boolean data being incorrectly converted to dates and addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
