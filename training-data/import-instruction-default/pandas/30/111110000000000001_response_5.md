1. The problematic function _try_convert_to_date is a method of the Parser class. It tries to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column.

2. The potential error location is within the try-except block that attempts to coerce objects into int64 format. Additionally, the logic for checking if numbers are out of range and the iteration over date units could potentially have issues.

3. The buggy function attempts to convert the input data into int64 format if it's of type "object". Then it checks if the data is within range and iterates over date units to convert the data into datetime format. The potential causes of the bug may be incorrect handling of type conversions and range checks, leading to incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handle the conversion of object type data into int64 format.
   - Improve the logic for checking if the numbers are out of range.
   - Simplify the iteration over date units to convert the data into datetime format.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False
    
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, TypeError):
            return data, False
```
This corrected code simplifies the logic by directly using `to_datetime` to parse the input data into datetime format. It handles potential errors using try-except block and returns the parsed data and a boolean indicating success or failure. This code should be a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
