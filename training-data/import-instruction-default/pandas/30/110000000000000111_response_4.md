1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into date formats, but it is currently incorrectly coercing boolean data into date formats, causing the error mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function is trying to handle the conversion of data types and filter out numbers that are out of range.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the block of code that handles the conversion of boolean values to date formats.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly treating boolean values as potential date data and attempting to convert them into timestamps, leading to unexpected behavior and errors. This aligns with the GitHub issue which describes how `read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools results in timestamps or an exception.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to add a conditional check for boolean data types at the start of the function. If the data type is boolean, the function should return the original data without attempting any date conversion.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    #  check for boolean data and return original data
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function includes a conditional check for boolean data types at the beginning, ensuring that the function returns the original data without attempting any date conversion if the data type is boolean. This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
