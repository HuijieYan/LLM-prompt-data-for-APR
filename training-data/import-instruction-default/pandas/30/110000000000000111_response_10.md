1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is likely related to the GitHub issue because it is meant to convert data into date format, but it is currently converting boolean data into timestamps, which is causing an error in newer versions of Pandas. The issue on GitHub is related to `read_json` method converting boolean values into timestamps when using `typ="series"`.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the logic for handling boolean data. It is currently trying to convert boolean data into timestamps, which is not the intended behavior.

3. The bug's cause is that the function `_try_convert_to_date` is not handling boolean data correctly, causing it to convert boolean values into timestamps instead of preserving them as boolean values. This behavior is consistent with the issue reported on GitHub, where boolean values are being incorrectly converted into timestamps as well.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean data differently so that it doesn't try to convert it into timestamps. We can add a condition to check for boolean data and handle it separately from the date conversion logic.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Handle boolean data separately
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected function includes an additional condition to handle boolean data separately, returning the original data as is and a `False` flag to indicate that the parsing was not successful. This should prevent the function from erroneously converting boolean values into timestamps, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
