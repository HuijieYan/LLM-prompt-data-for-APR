```
In the original function, the code within the first try-except block is attempting to convert the data to int64, but it was catching an incorrect exception (`TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError`) and not handling the conversion properly. This was leading to unexpected behavior when trying to convert data to date time. 

The revised function first checks if the data is empty and returns early if so. Then, it attempts to convert the data to numeric using `pd.to_numeric` and handles any errors appropriately. After that, it checks if the converted data is of numeric type using `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` and filters non-numeric elements. If the data is numeric, it attempts to convert it to datetime using `pd.to_datetime` and handles any errors correctly.

By making these changes, the revised function should be able to correctly convert the data to date time and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
