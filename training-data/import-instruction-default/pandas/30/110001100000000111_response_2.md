1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is called in the `pd.read_json` function when `typ="series"`. This function attempts to convert a given input into a date column, but it is causing issues when the input is a list of boolean values. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic related to converting the input data to datetime, as this is where the issue is occurring.

3. The bug is causing the `pd.read_json` function with `typ="series"` to incorrectly convert a list of boolean values into a datetime Series. This behavior is inconsistent with the desired output and with the behavior of the `typ="frame"` case. The GitHub issue provides details about the problem and the expected output, as well as the versions of Pandas, NumPy, and other packages being used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding a condition to check if the input data is boolean, and if so, directly return it as a boolean Series without attempting to convert to datetime.
   - Modifying the logic for converting data to datetime to properly handle boolean inputs.
   - Checking for other potential edge cases that could cause the issue and addressing them in the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False  # directly return as boolean Series

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function includes a specific check for boolean input data and returns it directly without attempting to convert it to datetime. This should fix the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
