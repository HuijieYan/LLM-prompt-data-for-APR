1. Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the buggy class, related functions, the github issue:
The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is inside the "Parser" class. It is responsible for converting data to date format. The GitHub issue suggests that when using the `pd.read_json()` function with `typ="series"` and a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps or an Exception instead of a Series of bools, which is the expected output. The issue is due to the function incorrectly converting the JSON list of bools to timestamps.

2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error seems to be in the conditional logic and type checking within the "_try_convert_to_date" function. Specifically, it is trying to convert bools to timestamps when it should be returning a Series of bools.

3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function: The function is incorrectly converting bool values to timestamps.
   (b). The buggy class: The "Parser" class contains the function and is responsible for parsing JSON data.
   (c). The related functions: The issue is related to the behavior of `pd.read_json()` when using `typ="series"`.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes the unexpected behavior of `pd.read_json` when using `typ="series"` with a JSON list of bools.

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The function should check the type of data being parsed and handle booleans separately, returning a Series of bools.

5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
            
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object" and new_data.str.contains('[Tt]rue|[Ff]alse').all():
            new_data = new_data.map({'true': True, 'false': False})
            return new_data, True
    
        return data, False
```
This corrected function checks if the data is of object type and contains only 'true' and 'false' strings. If so, it maps these strings to boolean values. This will ensure that the function returns a Series of bools as expected.
