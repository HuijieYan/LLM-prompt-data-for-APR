Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is when trying to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

Bug's Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrectly handling the conversion of data to a date column. The function is trying to handle different date formats and units, but the logic for coercing object types and handling numbers that are out of range may not be working as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the dtype of the data and handle the conversion of object types separately from other datatypes.
2. Handle the out-of-range numbers separately and ensure that they are correctly ignored or handled.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | ((new_data > self.min_stamp) & (new_data < self.max_stamp))
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```
