1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is within the class Parser. It appears to be attempting to convert data into a date column by checking for different date formats and coercing objects into integer formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the function checks whether the data is in range or not. The condition `if not in_range.all():` has the potential to return incorrect results and cause the function to return False even if the data is in range.

3. The buggy function is attempting to convert data into a date column. However, the condition for checking if the data is in range may not be functioning as intended, leading to false negatives. This causes the function to return False when the data is actually in range.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition for checking if the data is in range. Instead of returning False if the data is not in range, the function could continue processing and return the data if it is successfully converted into a date column. This way, the function will not prematurely return False if the data is in range but may have encountered some other non-serious issues during the conversion process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the function:
```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the function no longer checks if the data is in range using the `in_range` variable. Instead, it directly attempts to convert the data into a date column using the specified date units. If successful, it returns the converted data and True. If not, it continues to the next date unit until all date units have been attempted. If none are successful, it returns the original data and False.
