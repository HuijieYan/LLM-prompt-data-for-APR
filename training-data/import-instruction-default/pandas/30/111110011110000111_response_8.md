1. The buggy function is the `_try_convert_to_date` method within the `Parser` class. It is supposed to convert data to a date column and return a boolean indicating if the parsing was successful. The failing test is `test_readjson_bool_series` which is trying to read a JSON array of booleans and parse it into a series, but it is currently failing with a TypeError indicating that bool is not convertible to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the `_try_convert_to_date` function is at the line `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` where it is attempting to convert `new_data` to datetime, but this is failing for boolean input. This is consistent with the failing test and the GitHub issue, which both involve trying to read boolean values from a JSON array and convert them to a series.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not handling boolean input correctly, and it is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not valid. As a result, the failing test is triggering a TypeError because boolean values cannot be converted to datetime.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the type of the data before attempting to convert it to datetime, and handle boolean values differently from other data types.
   - Update the logic within the function to specifically handle boolean input and return the expected output.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an array-like input into a date column.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            if new_data.dtype == "bool":
                return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for boolean data and return False if the input data is boolean. This modification will handle boolean input correctly and fix the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
