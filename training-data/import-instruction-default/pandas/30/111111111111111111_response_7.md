Based on the analysis, the bug is likely to be located in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The bug causes the function to incorrectly convert boolean values to datetime, leading to a TypeError when the input data is a json list of bools.

The bug is caused by the function treating boolean values as if they were convertible to datetime, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and ensure that they are not treated as convertible to datetime. We can achieve this by adding a check for the data type before attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for boolean data types, and if the input data is of type "bool", it will directly return the data without attempting to convert it to datetime.

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the function handles boolean values correctly. It should also pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
