1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is trying to convert data to a date format, but it is not handling boolean values correctly, leading to a TypeError when trying to convert to datetime.
   - The failing test is trying to read a JSON with boolean values and expecting a Pandas Series of boolean values as output.
   - The error message indicates that boolean values are not convertible to datetime.

2. Potential error location:
   - The error is likely occurring in the try-except block where the data is being converted to int64.
   - Additionally, the logic for checking and handling boolean values is missing, leading to the TypeError.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The _try_convert_to_date function is not handling boolean values, resulting in a TypeError when trying to convert them to datetime.
   (b). The failing test is trying to read a JSON with boolean values but is not getting the expected output due to the buggy function.
   (c). The GitHub issue confirms that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of boolean values, and the current behavior is inconsistent and raises a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition in the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean values separately and return a Pandas Series of boolean values instead of trying to convert them to datetime.
   - Modify the logic for handling different data types in the function to include boolean values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # handle boolean values
        return pd.Series(new_data), True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
The corrected code includes a separate condition to handle boolean values and returns a Pandas Series of boolean values if the input is of type bool. This fix should resolve the TypeError issue and provide the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
