The issue seems to be related to the function `_try_convert_to_date` in the `Parser` class. The function is attempting to convert data into a date column, but is incorrectly returning datetime values instead of a Series of boolean values, leading to the TypeError. This issue has been raised on GitHub and is related to reading JSON with types as series.

The problem appears to be occurring in the case where the input data is a Series of boolean values, but the function incorrectly converts it into a datetime format, rather than preserving the boolean values.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where the input `data` is a Series of boolean values and ensure that it returns the correct output in this scenario. Additionally, it should handle the data dtype conversion properly and check the date units as per the requirements. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
class Parser():
    # corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the case where the input `data` is a Series of boolean values and ensure that it returns the correct output, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. And this fix should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
