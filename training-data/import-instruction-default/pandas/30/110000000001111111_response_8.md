The issue with the provided code is that it is incorrectly attempting to convert non-datetime input data into datetime format. As a result, it is returning incorrect results and raising exceptions. The GitHub issue title and description suggest that the problem arises when using `pd.read_json()` with `typ="series"` to read a JSON list of bools, resulting in timestamps and an exception instead of a Series of bools.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of `new_data` and converting it to datetime. The function should not attempt to coerce non-datetime data into datetime format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function returns the input data without converting it to datetime, as the input is already in the correct format. We should remove the entire try/except block that attempts to convert data to int64 and remove the datetime conversion process.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected code will return the input data without attempting to convert it to datetime, as the input is already in the correct format. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
