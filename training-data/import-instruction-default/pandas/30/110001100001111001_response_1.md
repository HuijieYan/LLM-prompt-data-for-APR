The issue in the function is that when the input data is of type "object", it attempts to convert it to "int64" which is incorrect. Instead, it should first try to parse the data as a date, and if that fails, then it should attempt to convert it to "int64".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    # try to parse as date
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        pass

    # try to convert to int64
    try:
        new_data = data.astype("int64")
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function first tries to parse the data as a date using the `to_datetime` function. If that fails, it then attempts to convert the data to "int64" as before. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
