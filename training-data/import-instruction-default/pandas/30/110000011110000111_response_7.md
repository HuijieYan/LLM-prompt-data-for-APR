1. The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date`, which is being called during the execution of the `read_json` function. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is trying to read a JSON with a list of boolean values and convert it to a pandas Series. The error message provides a `TypeError` stating that `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime. The GitHub issue also confirms that the problem is related to the conversion of boolean values into timestamps when it should actually return a Series of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the `to_datetime` method call. It seems that the function is trying to convert a boolean value into a datetime, which is causing the `TypeError` and the subsequent failure of the test.

3. The bug's cause can be identified based on the information from all the sources:
   (a). The `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert the input data into a date column, but the logic to handle boolean values is missing, leading to the erroneous conversion attempt.
   (b). The failing test is highlighting the specific case where the bug is triggered, i.e., trying to read a list of boolean values from JSON and convert them into a pandas Series.
   (c). The GitHub issue describes the problem in detail, providing examples, expected output, and the Pandas version where the behavior started causing an issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and return a Series of boolean values instead of converting them into timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    The function now handles boolean values separately, returning a Series of boolean values.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):  # handle boolean values separately
        return new_data.astype(bool), True  # return a Series of boolean values

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By handling boolean values separately and returning a Series of boolean values, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
