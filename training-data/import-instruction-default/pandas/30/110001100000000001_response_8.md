The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conversion of the data to int64 and then to datetime. There is a possibility of incorrect conversion or incorrect handling of exceptions, leading to the function returning incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we can directly convert the data to datetime and handle any exceptions that occur during the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected code directly converts the data to datetime and handles any exceptions that occur during the conversion. It simplifies the logic and avoids potential issues with converting to int64 and checking for ranges.
