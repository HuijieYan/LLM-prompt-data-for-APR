1. The bug occurs in the `_try_convert_to_date` function which is responsible for converting data into a date column. The problem arises when the function receives boolean data and tries to convert it into a datetime object, causing a TypeError. This is due to the incorrect handling of boolean data in the function.

2. The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert boolean data to a datetime object, which is not a valid operation. The function should handle different data types appropriately and not attempt to convert boolean data to a datetime object.

3. The failing test is attempting to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it to a Pandas Series. However, the function encounters a TypeError when attempting to convert boolean data to a datetime object, which is not the expected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to check the data type of the input and handle boolean values separately. In the case of boolean data, it should return the data as it is without attempting to convert it to a datetime object.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function introduces an additional condition to check for boolean data types and handle them appropriately without attempting to convert them to a datetime object.

This corrected function should handle boolean data and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
