There are some possible reasons for the bug existing in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. One reason could be that the function incorrectly parses boolean values as dates. The input data type and the expected output data type don't match. This is evidenced by the fact that the expected output should be a Series of boolean values, but the buggy function is returning a Series of timestamps in older Pandas versions, and raising a TypeError in newer Pandas versions.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values properly and ensure that it returns the expected data type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle boolean values properly and return the expected data type.
