1. The function _try_convert_to_date is trying to convert a boolean array to a datetime array, which causes the TypeError in the failing test. The class containing the function is not provided, but it likely contains metadata/settings for the data conversion. The failing test is attempting to read a JSON array of boolean values using the read_json function with typ="series", which results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location is the call to to_datetime, which attempts to convert the boolean array to a datetime array.

3. The bug is caused by the function _try_convert_to_date attempting to convert a boolean array to a datetime array when it should not. The failing test attempts to read a JSON array of boolean values, but the function incorrectly attempts to convert the boolean values to datetime.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the data type of the input array before attempting to convert it.
   b. Handle boolean arrays differently from datetime arrays.
   c. Modify the function to return the original array and a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False  # Return the original array and indicate conversion failure

        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

This corrected code checks the data type of the input array and returns the original array with a conversion success flag. In case of a boolean array, it returns the original array and indication of conversion failure. This fixed version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
