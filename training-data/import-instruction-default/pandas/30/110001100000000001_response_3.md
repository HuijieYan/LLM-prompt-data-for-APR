Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function is in the line `if new_data.dtype == "object":`. Here, the function tries to coerce the data into an "int64" type, but it does not check if the coercion was successful before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Bug's Cause: 
The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the coercion to "int64" correctly. If the coercion fails, it should handle the data differently, but instead, it continues with the assumption that the coercion was successful.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the coercion to "int64" was successful before proceeding.
2. If the coercion fails, handle the data differently.

Corrected code:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            # ignore numbers that are out of range
            if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    isna(new_data._values)
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                    | (new_data._values == iNaT)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
