1. The function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to parse an array-like object into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, and if not, it attempts to convert the data to an integer if it is an object type. Then it checks if the data is within a specified range and attempts to parse it as a date using the `to_datetime` function. The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is encountering a `TypeError` because it's trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not supported.

2. The potential error in the function is the absence of a check for boolean values, which leads to an unsupported conversion to datetime.

3. (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` checks for the data type and tries to convert it to integer if it's an object, and then proceeds to parse it as a date using `to_datetime`.
   (b). The function is part of the `Parser` class, which is used to parse JSON data. It has attributes for `date_unit` and `min_stamp`.
   (c). The failing test is attempting to read a JSON array of boolean values and convert it into a Series. The error message indicates that the boolean value is not convertible to datetime, which is being triggered by the `_try_convert_to_date` function.
   (d). The error message clearly states that a boolean value is causing the issue because it is not convertible to a datetime.

4. To fix the bug, a check for boolean values should be added to the `_try_convert_to_date` function before attempting to convert to an integer or parse as a date. The function should bypass the conversion for boolean values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            # bypass conversion for boolean values
            return data, False
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will now check for boolean values and return `False` to bypass the conversion if encountered. This should resolve the issue in the failing test and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
