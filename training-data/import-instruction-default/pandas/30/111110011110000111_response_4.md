Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is occurring when trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime object. This is happening when the input data is being processed inside the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

Bug's cause:
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion and results in a TypeError. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior for this function, and it causes issues when trying to read JSON data into a pandas Series with boolean values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
The _try_convert_to_date function needs to handle boolean values differently, recognizing that they should not be treated as date values. Additionally, the function should return the processed data and a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful.

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Parser():

    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        if new_data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function now includes handling for boolean values, returning them unchanged with a flag indicating the parsing was unsuccessful. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
