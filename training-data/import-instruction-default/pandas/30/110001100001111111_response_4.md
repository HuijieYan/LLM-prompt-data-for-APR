The bug in the function `_try_convert_to_date` appears to be in the if condition that checks if the data type is "object". If this condition is true, it tries to convert the data to int64, which is not the correct behavior. 

The issue posted on GitHub suggests that the `pd.read_json` function with `typ="series"` of a list of bools is resulting in timestamps or an exception, when the expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic of the function to correctly handle the conversion of the data based on its type. Since the input can be of type `RangeIndex` or `Series` of bools, we need to handle both cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if data.empty:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if isinstance(new_data, Series) and issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):
        return new_data, False

    if isinstance(new_data, Series) and issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.integer):
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="ignore", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True

    if isinstance(new_data, RangeIndex) or isinstance(new_data, Series):
        return new_data, False
```

This corrected function should handle both the `RangeIndex` and `Series` input cases correctly. This fix should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub as well.
