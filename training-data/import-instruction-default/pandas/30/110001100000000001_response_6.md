Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function lies in the 'if new_data.dtype == "object":' block, as well as the 'if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):' block. Both of these blocks attempt to check the data type of 'new_data' and perform operations based on that data type. However, the dtype attribute of a numpy array is an object, so checking 'new_data.dtype == "object"' will always return True. Similarly, 'new_data.dtype.type' will also always return <class 'numpy.object_'>. This leads to incorrect logic being executed for different data types, potentially causing the function to fail.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is related to incorrect handling of data types in the if statements mentioned above. The function attempts to coerce data into int64 based on its type, but the logic is flawed due to the incorrect assessment of data types. This results in incorrect processing of data that can lead to failed parsing and inaccurate results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the elements within the numpy array instead of the array itself.
2. Use numpy functions like np.isnumeric() to check if elements can be coerced into int64.
3. Properly handle exceptions to ensure that the function doesn't fail due to incorrect data type handling.
