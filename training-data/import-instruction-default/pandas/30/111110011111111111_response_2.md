The bugs associated with the function `_try_convert_to_date` in class `Parser` are causing the TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime. The issue arises when the function `to_datetime` is called on boolean data.

The problem originates from the fact that the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempts to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion. Specifically, the error occurs when attempting to convert a JSON list of booleans to a Pandas Series using `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data separately and prevent the attempt to convert it to datetime.

The corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function is provided below:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == bool:
            return new_data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The changes made in the corrected code include:
1. Added a condition to check if the `dtype` of `new_data` is boolean.
2. If the `dtype` is boolean, the function returns the boolean data as is, along with a `False` flag to indicate that the parsing was not successful.
3. This change ensures that boolean data is not coerced into datetime, resolving the issue reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.

The corrected `_try_convert_to_date` function has been provided as a complete drop-in replacement for the original buggy version. This correction is expected to resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
