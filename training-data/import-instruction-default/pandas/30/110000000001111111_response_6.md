The problem appears to be related to the _try_convert_to_date method, which is used to coerce an object into a date column. The issue seems to be arising when attempting to convert a Series of boolean values to a date column, which is not expected behavior.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the method is incorrectly treating boolean values as timestamps, whereas the expected behavior is to produce a series of boolean values.

The GitHub issue further corroborates this by indicating that using pd.read_json with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools results in the unexpected behavior of producing timestamps or raising an exception.

To fix this bug, the method needs to be updated to handle boolean values separately and return a series of boolean values. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for boolean values and convert them to a boolean type explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # Convert boolean values explicitly to boolean type
        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False

        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This updated function includes a condition to explicitly handle boolean values and return them without conversion.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on the GitHub issue by producing the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values.
