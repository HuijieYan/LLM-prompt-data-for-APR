The potential error in the buggy function is in the section that checks for overlapping indices and in the section that handles non-overlapping indices. The code tries to handle overlapping and non-overlapping indices separately, but there are issues in both sections.

The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of overlapping and non-overlapping indices, leading to incorrect results in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices, and ensure that the correct operations are performed according to the type of indices being processed.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Comparing overlapping indices is not supported")
    else:
        # Handle non-overlapping indices
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the if-else conditions for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices separately. Instead, we use the `is_overlapping()` method to determine if the indices are overlapping and handle the cases accordingly.

This approach maintains a more cohesive and cleaner logic for handling the different types of indices, which addresses the potential source of the bug.
