1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This class inherits from `Index` and also contains methods such as `left`, `right`, `closed`, `values`, `dtype`, `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `get_loc`, `get_indexer`, `where`, and `equals`. The `get_indexer` function is overwritten in the `IntervalIndex` class but has the same name and signature as a function from the superclass, which leads to ambiguity.

2. The potential error location is the use of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class, along with method overriding ambiguity due to the identical name and signature between the subclass and superclass.

3. (a) The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is intended to return an indexer array for the target array. However, it seems to have ambiguity due to the same function name and signature present in the superclass.
   (b) The `IntervalIndex` class contains overridden methods like `left`, `right`, `closed`, `values`, `dtype`, `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `get_loc`, `get_indexer`, `where`, and `equals`.
   (c) The related functions provide additional functionality to the `IntervalIndex` class but do not directly contribute to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Renaming the overridden `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to avoid ambiguity and clarify its purpose.
   - Utilizing the correct method from the superclass for indexing functionality, and implementing any additional required logic within the subclass.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    # Rename the overridden get_indexer method in the IntervalIndex class to resolve ambiguity
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer_interval(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        # Include the required logic for indexing functionality here
        # ...
```
By renaming the overridden `get_indexer` method to `get_indexer_interval` in the `IntervalIndex` class, we resolve the ambiguity and ensure that the correct method is called when indexing functionality is needed. Any additional logic related to indexing functionality can be implemented within the `get_indexer_interval` method in the `IntervalIndex` class.
