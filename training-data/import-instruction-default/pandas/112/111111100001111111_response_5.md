The buggy function is `get_indexer` found in the class `IntervalIndex`. The function is failing to handle the input when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing the `round` method to fail when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. The issue on GitHub describes that the `round` method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which should work as normal.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles the case when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, as the code is not properly handling the scenario when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of code that handles the `target_as_index` to also handle the case when it is a `CategoricalIndex`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle this case properly and return the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # remaining code for handling other cases
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we have added an additional check to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This ensures that the function can handle this scenario properly and return the expected output.

With this corrected code, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the `round` method should work as normal even when the columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
