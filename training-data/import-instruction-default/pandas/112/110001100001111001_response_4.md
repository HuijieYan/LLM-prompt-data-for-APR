The bug in the function `get_indexer` is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `if self.is_overlapping` condition. When checking for overlapping indices, the function should call `self.is_overlapping()` as a method to get the value, instead of simply referencing `self.is_overlapping`. Additionally, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` should be changed to `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly check for the value of the method.

To fix the bug, the function `get_indexer` should be updated as follows:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly check for overlapping indices and handle them accordingly.

This should fix the bug and the corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.

Please note that the fix provided assumes that the issue lies with the `if self.is_overlapping` condition. If there are other issues in the function, additional debugging and modifications may be necessary.
