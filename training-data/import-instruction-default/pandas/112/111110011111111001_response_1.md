The issue with the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the method signature not matching with the expected input. The error suggests that there is no matching signature found for the function.

Looking at the code, the `get_indexer` function is defined twice in the class `IntervalIndex`, which might be the cause of the issue. It seems that the intention is to overwrite the original `get_indexer` method, but due to the method being defined with the same name but different signatures, it is causing a conflict.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate declaration of the `get_indexer` method. The method should only be defined once with the correct signature.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
  
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
      
        return super().get_indexer(target, method, limit, tolerance)
```

In this corrected version, the `get_indexer` method is defined once with the correct signature, and it calls the superclass implementation of the method using `super().get_indexer(...)`. This should fix the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
