The issue is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a "TypeError: No matching signature found" when trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This suggests that there may be a mismatch in the function signature or argument types.

Upon examining the code, it seems that the `get_indexer` method is being redefined in the `IntervalIndex` class, which can cause confusion and potentially the error. This redefinition may be causing the mismatch in the function signature.

The failing test and error message indicate that when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, it fails with a TypeError.

The expected output is that the `round` method should still work as normal, even when the columns are CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

The GitHub issue suggests that when using `pd.cut` to create CategoricalIndex from an IntervalIndex, which are then used as columns in a DataFrame, the `round` method does not work as intended.

To fix the bug, the redefinition of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class should be removed. This should resolve the mismatch in function signatures and address the TypeError. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    return super().get_indexer(target, method, limit, tolerance)
```

This corrected code removes the redefined `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class and uses the implementation from the parent class.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolves the GitHub issue.
