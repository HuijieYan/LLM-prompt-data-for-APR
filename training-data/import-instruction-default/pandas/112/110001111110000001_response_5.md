The problematic function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.interval` module. The `get_indexer` function is used to get index of the target array-like values within the `IntervalIndex` object. However, it seems that the problem is arising from a malformed signature definition within the function.

The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to create a `DataFrame` using an interval-based `CategoricalIndex` and then perform a rounding operation on it. The error message indicates that the problem occurs within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex`, specifically within the `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` call.

It appears that the issue is due to a mismatch between the expected signature of the `get_indexer` function and the signature that is being provided when it is called, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, the signature of the `get_indexer` function should be updated to match the expected usage in the code. This can be done by providing the correct datatype of the `target` parameter in the function definition.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Import statements
# ... (same as the provided imports)

# ...(Same as the source code of the buggy function)

# Corrected version of the get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Adjust target parameter type to match the expected usage
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # ...(rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this correction, the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case should be resolved, and the updated `get_indexer` function should pass the failing test.
