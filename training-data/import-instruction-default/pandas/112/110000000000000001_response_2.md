The potential error location within the problematic function is within the block of code that deals with the target_as_index being an IntervalIndex. This block of code contains multiple conditional checks and calculations which may lead to potential errors.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle the case where the target_as_index is an IntervalIndex appropriately, leading to potential incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should thoroughly review the conditional checks and calculations in the block that deals with IntervalIndex and ensure that they handle all possible scenarios correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='int64')
        for i, val in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                indexer[i] = self.get_loc(val)
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: call get_loc for each key
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, I have simplified the logic by directly using the get_loc method to obtain the indexer values for the IntervalIndex target. This eliminates the need for several conditional checks and calculations, which reduces the potential for errors. Additionally, I have initialized the indexer with an appropriate data type and used a try-except block to handle KeyErrors when calling get_loc.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
