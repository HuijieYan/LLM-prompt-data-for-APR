The potential error is located in the section where the code checks for overlapping indices. The function should be able to handle non-overlapping indices as well.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of non-overlapping indices, leading to incorrect matches being returned when comparing the left and right indices.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly handle non-overlapping indices and ensure that the comparison between left and right indices is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The source code of the buggy function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```
