The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class, which is a subclass of `Index`. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round values in a DataFrame with a categorical index of intervals, and it fails with a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to mismatched or missing type signatures, specifically in the `get_indexer` method.

The bug's cause might be due to incorrect type annotations or method signature incompatibility within the `get_indexer` method. The failing test suggests that the `get_indexer` method might not be handling the target properly or might not be matching the expected method signature. The error message indicates that the issue is occurring at the C level, possibly due to mismatches with C level types.

To fix the bug, we can update the type annotations and method signature to ensure compatibility with the target types. Additionally, we need to handle the interval index in a way that aligns with the expected behavior when rounding the values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # fix: invoke is_overlapping as method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code from the original function remains the same
```
