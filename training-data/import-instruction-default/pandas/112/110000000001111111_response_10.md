The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` seems to stem from the inappropriate handling of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` when trying to round the values. This causes a `TypeError` to be raised. The input parameters and relevant variables at the return are all correctly reflected in the GitHub issue, which demonstrates the failure of the `round` function in the described scenario.

The issue occurs when trying to round values in a DataFrame `df2` with columns of type `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` using the `pd.cut` function. This causes a `TypeError` instead of correctly rounding the values. The error likely originates from how the function is handling the input parameters when creating the `target_as_index` variable.

To fix this issue, one possible approach would be to explicitly handle the scenario when the target is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. The function should check for this specific case and implement the appropriate logic to handle rounding for this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the function, taking into consideration the GitHub issue and the input/output variable information provided:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Check if the target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # Special handling for rounding when the target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex
        return np.round(target_as_index.codes, decimals=0)
    else:
        # Other scenarios are handled as before
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # ... (rest of the original logic)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # ... (rest of the original logic)
        else:
            # ... (rest of the original logic)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically check for the case when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` and handle the rounding appropriately by applying `np.round` to the `target_as_index.codes`.

This corrected function should now properly handle the rounding of values in a DataFrame with columns of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, as described in the GitHub issue.
