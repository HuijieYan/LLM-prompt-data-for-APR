The buggy function is `get_indexer` and it is part of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is supposed to perform indexing, but it is failing with a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The failing test, `test_round_interval_category_columns`, is trying to round a dataframe with `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` columns and it fails, raising the mentioned error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely due to the `get_indexer` method failing to handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The cause of the bug is the `get_indexer` method not being able to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This occurs due to an issue with the conditional logic and handling of the `CategoricalIndex`.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to properly handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This involves refining the conditional logic and ensuring that the `get_indexer` method can handle this scenario without raising a `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the problematic function
# Assuming the use of the `get_indexer` method from the same class
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, pd.CategoricalIndex)):
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and resolve the problem for when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This change should allow the `round` method to work as expected in the scenario described in the failing test and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
