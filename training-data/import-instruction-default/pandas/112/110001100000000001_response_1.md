Upon analyzing the buggy function and its related functions, it appears that the potential error location lies in the `is_overlapping` attribute call within the buggy function. The buggy function aims to check if the interval is overlapping, but it erroneously uses `self.is_overlapping` as a property rather than calling the `is_overlapping` function.

The buggy function attempts to check if the interval is overlapping by using the `self.is_overlapping` attribute, assuming it is a method. However, the attribute `is_overlapping` refers to a function, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` to properly check for overlapping intervals.

To fix this bug, the `is_overlapping` function should be called as a method (i.e., `self.is_overlapping()`) to verify if the interval is overlapping.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # The remaining code of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` function is called as a method `self.is_overlapping()` to properly check for overlapping intervals.
