The issue seems to be related to the `round` method failing when the columns are of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This error is likely linked to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` method is where it handles the case for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It seems like there may be an issue with how it handles the `target_as_index` when it's a `CategoricalIndex` type.

The bug could be caused by the `get_indexer` method not handling the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly, leading to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame containing such columns.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to properly handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This involves ensuring that the indexer is calculated correctly for this specific scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the case where `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. We obtain the indexer using the `get_indexer` method of `CategoricalIndex` rather than continuing with the original logic.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the `round` method works as expected when columns are of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
