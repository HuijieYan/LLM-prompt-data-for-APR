The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to stem from the `is_overlapping` attribute not being called as a method, resulting in incorrect behavior and possibly raising an `InvalidIndexError` in cases where it shouldn't. Additionally, the handling of `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` seems to be causing issues when calling the `round` method on a `DataFrame` with `CategoricalIndex` columns.

To fix the bug, we need to address the method call for `is_overlapping` and ensure that the function handles `CategoricalIndex` columns correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function, taking into account the identified issues:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # Handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        # Handle other index types
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we have called `self.is_overlapping()` as a method to properly evaluate the condition. Additionally, we have included handling for `CategoricalIndex` columns by using the `get_indexer` method on `target_as_index` when it's either an `IntervalIndex` or a `CategoricalIndex`.

This should address the issues reported in the GitHub issue and resolve the bug related to the `get_indexer` function.
