Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is related to the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The function is responsible for handling the indexing of IntervalIndex objects and appears to be causing a TypeError when used with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function could stem from the logic where it handles the different types of target indexes. It seems to be treating the target index as if it were a homogeneous scalar index or a heterogeneous scalar index, which may not be the case when dealing with CategoricalIndex.

The bug may be caused by the function's inability to handle the CategoricalIndex properly, leading to a TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame containing such an index. This is in line with the GitHub issue, where users are experiencing issues with the `round` method when using CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex. This may involve adding a conditional check to detect the presence of a CategoricalIndex and handling it differently within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Fixed function to replace the buggy one
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex differently
        # Logic for handling CategoricalIndex
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # Default handling for other types of indexes
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this fixed code, we added a conditional check to handle the CategoricalIndex differently within the `get_indexer` function. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where the `round` method fails when using CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex.
