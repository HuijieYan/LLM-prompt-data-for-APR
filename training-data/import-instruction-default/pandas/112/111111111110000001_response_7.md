The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` attempts to round a DataFrame that contains a CategoricalIndex of intervals. The error message indicates that there is a "TypeError: No matching signature found" when trying to call the `get_indexer` method.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `_engine` method called within `get_indexer` is not accepting the `target_as_index.values` argument, leading to a TypeError. This is likely due to an incorrect signature or usage of the method.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be updated to accept the `target_as_index.values` argument and handle it appropriately. Additionally, the type signatures of the related functions such as `get_indexer` and `_engine` should be checked for compatibility. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Update: use the get_indexer_non_unique method for overlapping indices
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    # handle other cases as before
    # ...

```

By adding the handling of overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` should pass.
