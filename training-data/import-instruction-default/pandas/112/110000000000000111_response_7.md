1. The problematic function is `get_indexer`. The GitHub issue is related to the `round` method failing when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The function `get_indexer` is used to get the indexer of an index or a categorical. The relationship between the function and the GitHub issue is that the function might be incorrectly handling column data that is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to the failure of the `round` method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that handles the indexing for IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. It seems that the function may not be properly handling the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, resulting in the failure of the `round` method.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the function `get_indexer` not properly handling the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This can lead to an incorrect indexer being returned, causing subsequent methods like `round` to fail. The GitHub issue confirms this problem by stating that the `round` method fails when the columns are of this specific type.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Update the logic in the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the case when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
   b. Ensure that the indexer returned for this specific case is compatible with subsequent methods like `round` so that it does not lead to failure.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # Handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex cases
        indexer = self.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional block to handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This block calls a new method `get_indexer_non_unique` to handle the indexing for this specific case. This change ensures that the function properly handles the mentioned case, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
