The potential error in the buggy function is the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping:`. The variable `is_overlapping` is a method, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()`. 

The bug occurs because the code is attempting to access `self.is_overlapping` as an attribute rather than a method, resulting in a boolean value (`False` in this case) rather than the expected method. This leads to the incorrect execution path in the function.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be updated to `if self.is_overlapping():`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code should address the bug and produce the expected output based on the provided input parameter values and types.
