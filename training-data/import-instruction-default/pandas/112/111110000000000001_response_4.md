The problematic behavior in the buggy function is due to the use of `if self.is_overlapping:`. This condition should be checking the result of the method `is_overlapping()` rather than the method itself. That's because `is_overlapping` is a method, not a property or attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping()` method and then use the result of that method in the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
            
        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

Note that the only change in the code is in the if condition, where `self.is_overlapping` has been changed to `self.is_overlapping()`.

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly evaluate the condition using the result of the `is_overlapping()` method and raise an error if needed.
