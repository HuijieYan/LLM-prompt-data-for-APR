The buggy function `get_indexer` is defined in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. This function seems to be responsible for returning an indexer array for the input target array based on certain conditions and comparisons with the `interval` index.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the line:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
```
The `is_overlapping` property should be called as a method, i.e., `self.is_overlapping()`, as it seems to be a method or property of the interval index. This is likely causing the buggy behavior as it is not being called as a method.

The buggy function tries to perform various comparisons and operations based on the type of the `target` array and the `IntervalIndex`. It handles different cases such as when the target is an `IntervalIndex`, a homogeneous scalar index, or a heterogeneous scalar index.

To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` property should be called as a method `self.is_overlapping()` and its return value should be checked to perform the appropriate operations based on whether the intervals are overlapping.

Here's the corrected code:
