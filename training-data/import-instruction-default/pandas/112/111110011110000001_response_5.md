Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the faulty class, failing test, and error message, it is apparent that the issue is with the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with interval category columns, and during this process, it calls the `get_indexer` function, which results in a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. 

The root cause of the bug seems to be an issue within the `get_indexer` function itself, where the signature does not match with the expected input, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can update the `get_indexer` function to ensure it handles the input parameters correctly and returns the expected output. Below is the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the problematic function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = self._get_engine(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(
            target=target_as_index,
            method=method,
            limit=limit,
            tolerance=tolerance,
        )

    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we have made sure to call the `is_overlapping` function with parentheses to properly invoke the function. Additionally, we have appropriately handled the input and output of the function to match the expected behavior. This corrected `get_indexer` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue.
