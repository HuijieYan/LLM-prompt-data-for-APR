The potential error in the buggy function is the `if self.is_overlapping` condition. The problem lies in the fact that `self.is_overlapping` is a method, but the condition should be checking the result of calling the method, not the method itself.

The buggy function can be fixed by calling the `is_overlapping` method and using its return value to determine the logic flow. Additionally, the return type of the function needs to match the expected output based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> Any:
    self._check_method(method)
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        # remaining logic remains unchanged.....

```

In the corrected code, `self.is_overlapping()` is used instead of `self.is_overlapping` to call the method and make use of its return value. This ensures that the correct logic flow is followed based on the result of the `is_overlapping` method.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
