The potential error location within the problematic function is when it uses `self.is_overlapping` as a condition to branch the logic. 

The bug causes the conditional logic to always return `True` because the function `is_overlapping` is defined in the class as a method but it is not used correctly within the `get_indexer` function.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to call the `is_overlapping` method with parenthesis `self.is_overlapping()` to actually execute the method and get the result, rather than just referring to the method itself. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to get the result
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the logic remains the same
            # ...
```
