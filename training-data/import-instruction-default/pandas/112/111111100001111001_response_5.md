The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the case where `self.is_overlapping` is `False`. This results in the function attempting to handle overlapping indices, which leads to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where `self.is_overlapping` is `False` by directly returning the positional match when the input `target` is equal to `self`. We also need to handle the case where `target` and `self` have different closed or incompatible subtype by returning no matches. Additionally, we should properly handle the case where the input `target` and `self` are non-overlapping.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.equals(target_as_index):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we handle the cases where `self.is_overlapping` is `False` by directly returning the positional match when the input `target` is equal to `self`, returning no matches when the closed or subtype are different, and properly handling the non-overlapping case.

Please use this corrected code as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
