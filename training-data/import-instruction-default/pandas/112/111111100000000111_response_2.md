The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The `round` method fails when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This problem occurs due to a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the `find_common_type` function and the handling of different index types. It seems that the function is not able to handle the conversion from `CategoricalIndex` to `IntervalIndex` and this leads to the TypeError.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class is not able to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in the TypeError issue when the `round` method fails.

To fix the bug, one possible approach could be to add a condition in the `get_indexer` method to handle the case when the input is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This would involve checking the type of the input and appropriately handling the conversion to the correct index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class:

```
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex(target)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected code, a condition has been added to handle the case when the input is a `CategoricalIndex`. It converts the `CategoricalIndex` to an `IntervalIndex` before further processing. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
