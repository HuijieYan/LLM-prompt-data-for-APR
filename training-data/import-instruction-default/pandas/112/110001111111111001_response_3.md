The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the signature of the `get_indexer` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found." This implies that the method signature provided does not match what is expected by the caller. 

The failing test involves calling the `round` method on a DataFrame, which internally calls the `get_indexer` method. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the call to `get_indexer`, which suggests that the problem lies within that method.

Based on the failing test and the provided input variables, it seems that there is an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` method. The method signature seems to indicate a scalar parameter as the input, but the actual input seems to be an array or a sequence type.

To fix the bug, the signature of the `get_indexer` method should be updated to reflect the correct input parameter type, which seems to be an array or sequence type, rather than a scalar type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method with the updated method signature:

```python
# Corrected code for the problematic function

@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,  # Updated method signature to accept an array-like input
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` method should now accept an array-like input, as indicated by the failing test, and should no longer produce the `TypeError` reported in the error message.
