The bug seems to be caused by the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. When the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, the `get_indexer` method fails to handle this correctly and raises a `TypeError`.

The source of the bug is likely related to the handling of `target_as_index` when it is a `CategoricalIndex`. The method is not properly handling this case, leading to the incorrect behavior and the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the method should handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` differently to ensure that the rounding operation works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle the case when target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # The rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        # The code for handling non-IntervalIndex targets is as before
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With these changes, the `get_indexer` method should handle the case when `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` properly, and the rounding operation should work as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
