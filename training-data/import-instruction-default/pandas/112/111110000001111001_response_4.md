The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is designed to get the indexer for the target array, but it has a logic error that causes it to fail under certain conditions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles the case when the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`. The function tries to compare different properties of the `IntervalIndex` objects, such as `dtype` and `closed`, but the logic for handling these comparisons is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of comparisons between different `IntervalIndex` objects. The `dtype`, `closed`, `left`, and `right` properties are being compared and manipulated in a way that does not accurately reflect the logic required for finding the indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling the case when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` and ensure that the comparisons and operations are done correctly to produce the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                # handle the case when target_as_index is an IntervalIndex
                indexer = np.where(np.in1d(self, target_as_index), np.arange(len(self)), -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we revised the comparison logic when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` to use the `np.in1d` function to check for matching values between the two arrays. This should produce the expected results and fix the bug.
