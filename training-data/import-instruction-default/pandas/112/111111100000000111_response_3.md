The bug appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` method is used to obtain indexers to be used on the target index to align it with this index. The issue arises when columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, causing the `round` method to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the section where it handles different types of target indexes, specifically when it encounters a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method's inability to handle the specific scenario where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This is likely due to the method not accounting for this specific combination of index types and failing to provide a matching signature for the `round` method.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the scenario where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and update it to provide a matching signature for the `round` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, updated to handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue:

```python
# other imports as mentioned in the original request

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # other class methods and functions...

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        # Handle the scenario where columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle the specific scenario and provide a matching signature for the round method
            return np.round(target_as_index.codes)
        
        # Rest of the original code goes here...
```

By updating the `get_indexer` method to handle the specific scenario where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, and providing a matching signature for the `round` method, the bug should be resolved as per the requirements stated in the GitHub issue.
