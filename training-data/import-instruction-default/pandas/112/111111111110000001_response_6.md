The bug seems to be caused by the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is part of the pandas library. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round a DataFrame that includes a `CategoricalIndex` created using `pd.interval_range`, and it is failing with a `TypeError: No matching signature found` at the `get_indexer` method.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the issue could be related to the parameter type hint for the `get_indexer` method. The type hint `scalar_t[:]` seems to be causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the parameter type hint for `target` in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class should be updated to the correct type. In this case, it should be `AnyArrayLike` instead of `scalar_t[:]`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Assuming that the buggy file is the path: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# ... (other imports and class definitions)

    # this is the corrected function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,  # corrected parameter type hint
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now accept the correct type for the `target` parameter and pass the failing test.
