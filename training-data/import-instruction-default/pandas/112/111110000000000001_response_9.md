Potential error location: The buggy function `get_indexer` includes a check for `self.is_overlapping`, which is meant to be a method call, but it's used as if it were a property. This may lead to incorrect results.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `get_indexer` attempts to call `self.is_overlapping` as a property to determine if the index overlaps, but it's actually a method, so it should be called as a method.
(b). The class `IntervalIndex` seems to have a method `is_overlapping` that should be called with parentheses, but the buggy function currently treats it as a property.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change `self.is_overlapping` to `self.is_overlapping()`, calling the method instead of accessing it as a property.
2. Verify if the method `is_overlapping` in the `IntervalIndex` class returns a Boolean value, and use it accordingly in the subsequent conditional checks.

Corrected code:
```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
The corrected code ensures that the `is_overlapping` method is called with parentheses, and the result is used in the subsequent conditional checks.
