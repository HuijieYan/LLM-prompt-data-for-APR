The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `if self.is_overlapping`. This is using the `is_overlapping` attribute as a method without actually calling it properly. The correct way to call this would be `if self.is_overlapping()`, as `is_overlapping` is a function within the class.

The bug's cause is that the `is_overlapping` method/attribute is being incorrectly referenced without being properly called as a method within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class.

To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method/attribute needs to be called properly within the `get_indexer` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code properly calls the `is_overlapping` method within the `get_indexer` function and fixes the bug.
