The problem in the `get_indexer` function is with the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. It's missing the function call `()` after `self.is_overlapping` to actually call the method. This is causing the comparison to always evaluate to `True` because `self.is_overlapping` is a method object, and all objects in Python evaluate to `True`. This seems to be causing an error with the `round` method when the CategoricalIndex is made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the fix for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the condition by adding ()
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix should resolve the issue with the `round` method failing when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The corrected function now properly calls the `is_overlapping` method, which should resolve the problem.

This corrected code should be used to replace the buggy function in the pandas core indexes interval.py file.
