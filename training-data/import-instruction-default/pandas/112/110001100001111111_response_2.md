The problem with the buggy function is that it is raising an InvalidIndexError (with the message "cannot handle overlapping indices") when attempting to perform the `get_indexer` operation on a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output for the given GitHub issue, which expects the `round` method to work as normal.

The bug seems to be caused by the `self.is_overlapping` check, which always evaluates to True because it is missing the function call. This causes the function to mistakenly try to handle an overlapping index and raise an error, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, the function is not correctly handling the case when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `self.is_overlapping` check should be modified to call the function and correctly evaluate whether the index is overlapping. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
            return self._engine.get_indexer(target.categories)
        else:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code here ...

    # remaining code here ...
```

With this fix, the `get_indexer` function will now correctly handle the case when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. Additionally, the `self.is_overlapping` check is fixed to call the function and evaluate whether the index is overlapping.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `round` method works as expected for `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
