The issue seems to stem from the usage of `pd.CategoricalIndex` on an `IntervalIndex`, leading to a TypeError when attempting to perform operations like `round`.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the `get_indexer` method, specifically the conditional check for `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)`.

The bug's cause is likely due to the fact that the `get_indexer` method is not handling the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This is leading to the TypeError when the `round` method is called on a dataframe with a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, and ensure that the corresponding operations and methods are valid for this scenario as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target.categories
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged

        # rest of the code for handling other cases remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now correctly handle cases where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This should resolve the issue of the `round` method failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

This fix should resolve the GitHub issue where the `round` method fails when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
