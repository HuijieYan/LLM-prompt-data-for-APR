Potential Error Location:
The potential error may be in the part of the code where it checks for overlapping indices and in the handling of different types of target indices.

Bug's Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of overlapping indices and incomplete handling of different types of target indices.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for overlapping indices in a different way and handle them appropriately.
2. Include complete handling of different types of target indices to ensure proper matching.

Corrected Code:
```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # This line is corrected to call the method is_overlapping
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected code, the potential error location has been addressed by properly calling the `is_overlapping` method and updating the condition to `if self.is_overlapping()` to check for overlapping indices. This will ensure that the correct method is called to handle overlapping indices.
