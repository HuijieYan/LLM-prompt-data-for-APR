The buggy function 'get_indexer()' is related to the GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex". The issue describes how the round method fails when the columns are of type CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. The expected behavior is for the round method to work as normal.

The potential error location within the problematic function 'get_indexer()' seems to be in the conditional statement where it checks if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex). This is where the code is trying to handle different cases for IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex, and the bug may lie in how these cases are being handled.

The bug is likely caused by the code not properly handling the case where the columns are of type CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This could be due to incorrect handling of the different data types and indexes, leading to the failure of the round method for such columns.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to properly handle the case of CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This may involve making adjustments in the conditional logic and handling of different data types and indexes to ensure that the round method works as expected for all cases.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function 'get_indexer()', which should resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.codes

        indexer = np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    else:
        if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the above changes to the 'get_indexer()' function, it should now handle the case of CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex and ensure that the round method works as expected for all cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
