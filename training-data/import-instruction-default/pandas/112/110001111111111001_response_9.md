The potential error location within the problematic function is unclear, but the error message indicates a problem with the `get_indexer` method signature.

The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect type hints in the `get_indexer` method. The failing test and error message indicate that there is a type error related to the method signature, which might be caused by incorrect input type for the `target` parameter.

To fix the bug, the type hint for the `target` parameter in the `get_indexer` method should be adjusted to match the input type used in the failing test. Additionally, the type annotation for the return value should also be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: Any, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
```

By making these changes, the `get_indexer` method should now accept the correct input types and return the appropriate output, addressing the type error indicated in the failing test.
