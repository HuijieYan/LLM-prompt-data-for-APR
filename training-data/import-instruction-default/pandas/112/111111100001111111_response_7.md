The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be caused by a conditional check that is always evaluating to `False`. This check, `if self.is_overlapping`, is meant to iterate to the block of code for handling overlapping indices, but it never executes because `self.is_overlapping` is always evaluating to `False`. The original intent of the original code was likely to check if there are any overlapping intervals within the index.

To fix this issue, we need to update the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()`, assuming `is_overlapping` is a method that returns a Boolean value based on some internal logic. By calling the method `is_overlapping`, we should get the intended behavior of checking for overlapping intervals within the index.

Additionally, based on the GitHub issue, it seems that when columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the `round` method fails to work as expected. This could be related to the incorrect handling of the IntervalIndex, and fixing the `get_indexer` function might indirectly resolve this issue as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
...
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the change from `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()`, we are now calling the method to check for overlapping intervals within the index. This fix should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

This correction should also indirectly address the GitHub issue related to the `round` method failing when columns are of type CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
