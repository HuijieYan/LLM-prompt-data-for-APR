Potential error location: The bug is likely caused by the use of `if self.is_overlapping` without actually calling the `is_overlapping` method. This condition checks for overlapping indices, and if it's true, it raises an `InvalidIndexError`. However, `self.is_overlapping` should be called as a method to get the result, but it's being used as an attribute.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `is_overlapping` method to get the result and then use it in the condition.
2. Ensure that all the necessary methods are called with the correct parameters and handle the results properly.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """

    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to get the result
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
With this corrected version, the `_check_method` function is called with the correct `method` parameter, and the `is_overlapping` method is called to check for overlapping indices.
