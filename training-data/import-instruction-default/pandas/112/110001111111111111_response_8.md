Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely to be in the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

Bug's cause:
The issue seems to stem from a mismatch in the signature of the `get_indexer` method. The error message indicates that there is "No matching signature found" for the method call, which suggests that the method is not being called with the correct arguments or types.

Proposed approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should be checked to ensure that it is being called with the correct arguments and types. Additionally, it should be verified that the signature of the method is compatible with the expected input types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = ensure_platform_int(self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left))
        right_indexer = ensure_platform_int(self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right))
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = ensure_platform_int(self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index))
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected code ensures that the `get_indexer` method is called with the correct arguments and types, and that the signature of the method is compatible with the expected input types. It also handles the different cases of index types appropriately. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
