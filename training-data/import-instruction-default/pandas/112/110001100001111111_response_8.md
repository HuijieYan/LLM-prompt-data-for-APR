Potential error location within the problematic function: The bug might be in the `get_indexer` function where it checks if `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. There is a conditional statement for handling the case when `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`, but it does not handle the case when it is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in a TypeError when trying to call `get_indexer`.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The problematic function `get_indexer` assumes that `target_as_index` is always either an instance of `IntervalIndex` or a homogeneous scalar index. It does not handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
(b). The related functions like `equals` and `is_overlapping` check for equality and overlapping in a similar way that does not account for `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
(c). The expected input/output as provided in the GitHub issue is not handled by the current implementation of the function.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to add a conditional statement to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This conditional statement should consider the characteristics of `CategoricalIndex` and handle the `get_indexer` accordingly.

Additionally, the related functions such as `equals` and `is_overlapping` should also be updated to handle `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By adding a conditional statement to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, we can ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle this scenario. This approach should resolve the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub issue and allow `round` method to work as expected in the given scenario.
