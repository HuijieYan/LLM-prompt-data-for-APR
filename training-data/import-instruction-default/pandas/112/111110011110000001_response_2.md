The buggy function is `get_indexer` which is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is used to find the index of an item within the `IntervalIndex` object. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is attempting to use the `round` method on a DataFrame that has columns of type `CategoricalIndex` with intervals. This test is failing with an error related to `get_indexer` method when trying to perform some internal reindexing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This line is trying to call the `get_indexer` method of the `_engine` attribute, but the `_engine` attribute is not defined in the `IntervalIndex` class.

The bug's cause is that the `get_indexer` method is trying to call the `_engine` attribute, which is not defined in the class.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to first define the `_engine` attribute in the `IntervalIndex` class, and then implement the `get_indexer` method to use the `_engine` attribute to find the index of the target values.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Assuming the proper implementation of the _engine method
    def _engine(self):
        # implementation of the _engine method

# now the corrected get_indexer method
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            # Add the implementation for engine if the target is of type IntervalIndex
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # The rest of the code remains the same
            # ....
            
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By ensuring the `_engine` method is properly implemented, and using it in the `get_indexer` method when the target is of type `IntervalIndex`, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
