The potential error location within the problematic function is when it checks if `self.is_overlapping`. It then raises an error if the condition is true. This appears to be an issue because `self.is_overlapping` should be a method call rather than a property.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping` method using `self.is_overlapping()` to properly check if overlapping indices exist.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Fix: Call the method using ()
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged
            ...
```

This fix calls the `is_overlapping` method as intended, ensuring that the correct behavior is executed.
