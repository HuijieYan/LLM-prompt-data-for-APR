Based on the given code, it looks like the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class is the buggy function. The bug seems to be related to the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping`. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping`.

The bug's cause arises from the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping`. It seems that `is_overlapping` is being treated as a property or a method, but it should be invoked as a method to get its value.

To fix the bug, we need to invoke the `is_overlapping` method to get its value, and then proceed with the rest of the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy `get_indexer` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, `self.is_overlapping` is replaced with `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly invoke the `is_overlapping` method. The rest of the logic in the function remains the same. This corrected code should fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function.
