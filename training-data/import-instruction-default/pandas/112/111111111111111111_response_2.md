The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found, pointing to a type mismatch.

Upon analyzing the failing test, it is apparent that the `IntervalIndex` is wrapping the columns in a `CategoricalIndex`. This situation triggers the bug in the `get_indexer` function when trying to round the DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is unable to handle cases where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle cases where the columns are wrapped in a `CategoricalIndex`. Additionally, the bug seems to stem from type mismatches or unsupported signatures in the call to `get_indexer`. 

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class is provided below:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

        if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the provided code, we handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` before normalizing them to an `IntervalIndex` to avoid any type mismatches that could occur.

After making these changes, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle cases where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, and the test should pass successfully.

This fix should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post, ensuring that rounding works as expected when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
