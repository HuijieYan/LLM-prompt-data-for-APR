The potential error in the buggy function is the call to `self.is_overlapping` without using parentheses to actually call the `is_overlapping` method. This will always evaluate to `True` since it's checking if the method exists, rather than calling the method and checking its return value.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping` method by using parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By using `self.is_overlapping()` with parentheses, we ensure that the `is_overlapping` method is called and its return value is correctly evaluated.
