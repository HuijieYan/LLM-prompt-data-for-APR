The issue in the buggy function is with the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. The `is_overlapping` is a method, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()`.

To fix the bug, we need to make this change and also update the subsequent logic depending on the value returned by `self.is_overlapping()`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code remains unchanged
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Remaining code remains unchanged
    else:
        # Remaining code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making these changes, the function now properly calls the `is_overlapping` method and correctly handles the logic based on its return value.
