Based on the provided input/output variable information, it seems that the bug in the function `get_indexer` is occurring when handling the `target_as_index` variable of type `IntervalIndex`. The function attempts to handle `target_as_index` differently if it is an `IntervalIndex` or not, and this handling seems to be causing the bug.

The potential error location within the function is when processing the `target_as_index` within the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)` block. The function tries to compare different attributes of `target_as_index` such as `dtype` and `closed` with the `self` object, and then proceeds to perform specific operations based on the comparison. It is likely that this comparison or subsequent operation is leading to incorrect results.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`. The function does not seem to be accurately determining the matching indices based on the inputs provided.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to revisit the logic that compares and processes the `target_as_index` with the `self` object. It is important to ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the relationship between the two and that the subsequent operations are performed correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the `target_as_index` is equal to `self`. If it is equal, it returns the range of indices. If it is not equal, it returns an array of -1 of the same length as `target_as_index`. If `target_as_index` is not an `IntervalIndex`, it directly uses the engine to get the indexer.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the provided input/output variable information.
