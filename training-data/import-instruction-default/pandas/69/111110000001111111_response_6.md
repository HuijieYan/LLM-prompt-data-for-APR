The potential error in the buggy function can be found in the loop where it checks the type of the index and the key. The function is incorrectly checking if the index is an integer index, but it should be checking if it is a float index. This is causing the function to raise an error in cases where it shouldn't.

The bug's cause is due to the function incorrectly checking the index type when comparing it to the key. The function is not properly handling the case where the index is a Float64Index or a timedelta index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check the type of the index and handle the different cases for float and integer indices.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_float(i) and not ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index "
                    "can only have non-float indexers"
                )
            elif is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )

        return key
```

This corrected code properly checks the type of the index and the key, and handles the different cases for float and integer indices. This code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
