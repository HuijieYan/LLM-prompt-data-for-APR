The buggy function `_convert_key` is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. It fails to correctly handle the case where the index is a `Float64Index` and the key is a float or integer. The key should be checked to be of the same type as the index, rather than checking if it's an integer or a scalar.

The initial part where it checks if it's a setter is working correctly, so the bug lies in the for loop after that if statement.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic inside the for loop to check whether the key `i` belongs to the same type as the index `ax`. We can use the function `is_list_like` to handle different types of indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not is_list_like(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
            if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax[0])} "
                    f"can only have indexers of type {type(ax[0])}"
                )
        else:
            if not is_list_like(i) and is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax[0])} "
                    f"can only have non-list-like indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected version of the function handles the case where the index and the key are both list-like and also scenarios where both are scalar values. It also provides clearer error feedback in case of value mismatch between the index and the key.

With this corrected version, the failing test case should pass without raising a `ValueError` as shown in the error messages.
