1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The function is related to Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements where it checks if the axes are integers and then validates the indexers.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where the axes are Float64Index and the indexers are floats.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add checks for Float64Index and handle the indexers accordingly.
   - Use the appropriate functions for handling the validation of indexers based on the type of index.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index): # check if the index is a Float64Index
            if not is_float(i): # validate the indexers for Float64Index
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers")
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected version of the function includes checks for a Float64Index and handles the indexers accordingly. It also ensures that the appropriate validation is performed based on the type of index.
