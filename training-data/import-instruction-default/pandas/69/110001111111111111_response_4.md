The issue with the buggy function `_convert_key` in the pandas library appears to be related to the mismatch between the types of keys and the index. Specifically, the function is raising a `ValueError` when an integer index has non-integer indexers, or when a non-integer index has integer indexers.

This issue is related to the behavior of `Float64Index` and the `Series` it operates on. When attempting to perform index-based lookups using `get_value` or other methods, the function is not handling the conversion of the key appropriately.

To fix this issue, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion of keys based on the type of index. It should check the type of the index and the type of the key, and handle the conversion accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(ax[0]):
            i = float(i)
        elif is_float(i):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
        return key
```

This updated function checks the type of the index and the key, and handles the conversion of the key appropriately. It should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
