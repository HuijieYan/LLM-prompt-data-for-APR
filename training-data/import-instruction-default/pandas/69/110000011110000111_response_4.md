The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to a ValueError being raised when using `ser.at[4]` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to properly handle non-integer indexes.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have scalar indexers"
                )
        elif not is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                "index can only have non-list-like "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This updated function checks for a numeric index, and if so, ensures that the indexer is a scalar. If the index is non-numeric, it checks that the indexer is not list-like.

By making these changes, the function can handle non-integer indexes properly and avoid raising errors in the failing test scenario.

This fix addresses the issues identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
