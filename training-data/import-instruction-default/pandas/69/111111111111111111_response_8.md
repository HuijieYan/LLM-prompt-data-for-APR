The issue in the buggy function `_convert_key` is that it incorrectly checks for integer type using `is_integer` method, which is an internal method and should not be used for type checking. Instead, the correct method for checking integer type is `is_numeric_dtype`. Another issue is with the comparison `if not ax.holds_integer()`, which is not the correct way to check if the index holds integer type.

The failing test and error messages show that the function is not correctly handling the cases for datetime and timedelta indexes. The error message specifically mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", which suggests that the function is not properly handling the cases for non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to correctly check for integer and non-integer types and handle datetime and timedelta indexes properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

Now that we have fixed the function, it should properly handle the cases for both numeric and non-numeric indexes, including datetime and timedelta indexes.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
