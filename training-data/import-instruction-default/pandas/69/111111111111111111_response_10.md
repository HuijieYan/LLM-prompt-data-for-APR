The potential error in the function `_convert_key` is likely located in the logic that checks if the index is integer or non-integer. It seems that the function does not handle non-integer index properly, leading to a ValueError.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of non-integer indexes. The code is raising a ValueError when it encounters a non-integer index, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i):
                    i = int(i)
                elif isinstance(i, float):
                    i = float(i)
                elif isinstance(i, str):
                    i = str(i)
                elif isinstance(i, datetime.datetime):
                    i = i
                elif not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected version handles non-integer indexes more gracefully by checking the type of the index and appropriately casting the key value to match the index type.

This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
