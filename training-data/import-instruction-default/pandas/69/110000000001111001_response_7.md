The bug in the provided code appears to be caused by the incorrect usage of ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer() methods. The issue seems to arise from the fact that these methods are meant to be called on an index object, but in the code, they are being called directly on elements of the index.

To fix the bug, we can use the is_integer() and holds_integer() methods directly on the index object rather than on its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for the given cases.
