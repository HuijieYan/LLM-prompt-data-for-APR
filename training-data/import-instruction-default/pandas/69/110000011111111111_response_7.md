The bug is in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the check for integer keys in non-integer indexes. The function does not handle non-integer indexes correctly, leading to a ValueError in the failing tests.

The issue is that the function is incorrectly checking for integer keys in non-integer indexes, which is not necessary.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the check for integer keys in non-integer indexes and simplify the function to handle setting arbitrary keys.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    return key
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, effectively resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
