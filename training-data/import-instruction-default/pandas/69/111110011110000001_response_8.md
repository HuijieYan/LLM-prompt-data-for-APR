The error is within the `_convert_key` function, in the `for` loop that iterates over `self.obj.axes` and `key`. The error message is "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The root cause of the bug is that the loop doesn't handle non-integer indexers correctly. This causes the `ValueError` to be raised when attempting to use the `at[]` method with a non-integer index.

To fix the bug, we need to handle non-integer indexers properly in the loop and remove the portion of code that raises the `ValueError`. This can be addressed by removing the entire else block since it is checking for a condition "if the index isn't an integer index, than 'i' (the indexer) should also not be an integer." The for loop iteration would thus only need to check for ax.is_integer(), and remove the checks for holds_integer() and is_integer(i).

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected version ensures that the keys are of the same type as the index and avoids raising a `ValueError` for non-integer indexers. This version of the function should pass the failing test.
