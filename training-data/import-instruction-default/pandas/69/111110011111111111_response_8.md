The buggy function `_convert_key` is throwing a `ValueError` when the condition `is_setter` is `False` and it is checking the index type against the value type. It should instead check the type of index and value if it's allowed or not allowed.
The issue seems to be with the validation of the key based on the type of index. The for loop is checking if `ax` is integer or not, and then checking if `i` is integer or not, which is throwing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to check if `ax` is of float type, and then check if `i` is float or not and similarly for non-integer type. This requires updating the logic in the else part of the loop for each condition.

The code can be updated as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:  # for other types of index
            if is_float(i) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This approach ensures that the key is checked based on the type of index and is_float function is used to check if the value is a float. This code will fix the bug and also pass the failing test.

With this corrected function, it should resolve the issue posted in the github issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
