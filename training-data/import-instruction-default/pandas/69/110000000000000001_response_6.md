1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. It also checks if the key is an integer type or not based on the index type. However, there are several issues in the function related to the method calls and condition checks.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional checks for the index type (integer or non-integer) and the type of the key.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is using incorrect method calls like `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` which are not valid methods.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the correct method calls for checking the type of the index and key.
   - Handle the conditions based on the type of the index and key more accurately.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, `is_numeric_dtype` is used to check if the index is numeric, and `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` are used to check the type of the key. The conditions are also handled based on the type of the index and key more accurately. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
