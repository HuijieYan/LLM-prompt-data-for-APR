Upon analyzing the function and its relationship with the class, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison and validation of the index and the key. The function is not handling cases where the index is a float index and the key is an integer or float. This causes the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly.

The potential error location is in the loop where the function checks if the index axis is an integer and then compares it with the key. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling cases where the index is a float index and the key is an integer or float. This leads to incorrect value errors being raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to handle cases where the index is a float index and the key is an integer or float. We can use the 'is_float' and 'is_integer' functions to perform the necessary validations.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-scalar index "
                    "can only have non-scalar indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a scalar index can only have scalar indexers"
                )
            if not is_sequence(i) and not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-scalar index "
                    "can only have non-scalar indexers"
                )
            if is_sequence(ax):
                if not is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-scalar index "
                        "can only have non-scalar indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a scalar index can only have scalar indexers"
                    )
                if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
                if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now handle the cases mentioned in the various scenarios and satisfy the expected input/output. Additionally, it addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
