1. There seems to be an issue with the `_convert_key` function inside the `_AtIndexer` class, which is leading to failures in the test cases. The failing test cases indicate a problem with non-integer indexes.

2. The potential error location is the logic inside the `_convert_key` function, specifically the part where it checks if the index is integer or non-integer and the corresponding indexer.

3. The buggy function is failing due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The failing test and error message indicate that there are discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values. The GitHub issue title and description provide additional context about the nature of the bug and its impact on Series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `_convert_key` function correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes.
   - Update the logic to properly handle the conversion of keys based on the type of the index.
   - Add conditional checks to accommodate for different index types and their corresponding key types.
   
5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the `_convert_key` function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly, resolving the issues observed in the failing test cases and meeting the expected input/output variable values. This should also address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
