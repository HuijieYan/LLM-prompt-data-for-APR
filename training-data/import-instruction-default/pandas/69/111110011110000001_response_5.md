The flag `is_setter` is not appropriately used in the `_convert_key` function. The function expects the key to be the same type as the index and raises a `ValueError` when that's not the case. However, it becomes clear that the flag `is_setter` is not being appropriately utilized to allow arbitrary setting, nor is it being passed as an argument in the test cases. This is causing the function to always raise the `ValueError` as it can never satisfy both the `if` and `else` conditions for the `is_setter` flag and key type. To fix this, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly use the `is_setter` flag to allow arbitrary setting of the key.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the `is_setter` flag correctly by allowing arbitrary setting of the key using a list when the flag is `True`. This will make the function work as intended and resolve the error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, unless is_setter is True.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this modification, the function should work as intended and pass the failing test.
