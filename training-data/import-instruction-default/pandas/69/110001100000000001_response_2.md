# The buggy function has a potential error in the for loop where it is iterating through the object's axes and the input keys. It is trying to validate whether the keys are of the same type as the index, but it is using the wrong method to check for integer type.

# To fix the bug, we need to use `is_integer` method to check if the axis is integer type and `is_integer` function to check if the key is integer type.

# Corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# this is the fixed function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
