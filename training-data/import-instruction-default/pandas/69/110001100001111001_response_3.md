Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the buggy function and a corrected version of the function:

Potential Error Location:
The function should check if the index type is an integer or not and then compare it with the type of key that is being passed.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function does not correctly check the type of the index and key when comparing them. This leads to incorrect type comparisons and incorrect error handling.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the function to properly check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key. Additionally, the error messages need to be adjusted to reflect the correct error condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric-based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Non-numeric-based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the index is numeric and then compares it with the type of the key accordingly. It also provides the correct error messages based on the type comparison. This fix satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
