Potential error location within the problematic function:
The buggy function attempts to verify that the key remains compatible with the index being accessed. However, the function incorrectly determines that the key is an integer or non-integer when it should be checking for float or integer data types.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function uses the `is_integer()` method to verify that the key being accessed is of a certain type, but it should be using the `is_float()` method. This discrepancy causes the bug, leading to incorrect error handling when the key does not match the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the appropriate method (`is_integer` or `is_float`) to check the type of the key.
2. Implement conditional checks to verify the type of the key based on the index's data type.
3. Update error handling to reflect the correct type checks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i):
            if not is_float(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index "
                    "can only have non-float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
