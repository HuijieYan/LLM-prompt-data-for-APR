The issue occurs when the function tries to determine if the key is an integer or not. It incorrectly assumes that because the index is of a float type (`Float64Index`) the key should always be float as well. However, in the failing test cases, the keys are integers, and when the function checks if the key is an integer using `is_integer()`, it is always false and the function raises a `ValueError`. This leads to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks the type of the key. Instead of comparing the key to the index, we should check if the key is an integer or not directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for i in key:
        if not is_scalar(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing can only have scalar indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this correction, we are checking if the key is a scalar (whether integer, float, or other types) and raising a value error if it is not a scalar. This will handle both integer and float keys correctly and fix the failing test cases.
