The potential error in the function `_convert_key` is occurring when checking if the axis is an integer using `ax.is_integer()`, and checking if the indexer is an integer using `is_integer(i)`. This is likely the cause of the ValueError being raised when the condition is not met.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the if conditions to properly check if the axis is an integer or not, and then compare it with the indexer accordingly. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the key is a setter.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i):
                if not ax.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the if conditions to check if the indexer `i` is an integer and compare it with the axis, and vice versa. We also handled the case for setter by directly returning the list of the key.

With these changes, the function should now work correctly without raising any ValueErrors.
