After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_convert_key` function is causing the failing test. The bug occurs when the function tries to handle non-integer indexes using integer indexers, causing a ValueError.

The root cause of the bug is related to the handling of non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function, which is not properly validating the key and causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly by checking the type of the index and the type of the key, and raising a ValueError if the types are incompatible.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _convert_key function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected implementation checks the types of the index and the key and raises a ValueError if they are incompatible. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

By using the corrected `_convert_key` function, the failing test should pass successfully, and the reported bug in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
