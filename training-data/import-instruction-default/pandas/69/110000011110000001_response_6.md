The buggy function `_convert_key` is expecting the indexer to be the same type as the index, and raises a `ValueError` if it detects a mismatch. The error message from the failing test indicates that the problematic line is:
```python
result = ser.at[4]
```
This line is using the `at[]` method, and `4` is an integer value. The function is expected to handle the cases where the index as well as the indexer are non-integer values.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle integer indexers well for non-integer indices. It raises a `ValueError` when it should be able to handle non-integer index with non-integer indexers. Thus, the function fails to handle the non-integer index queries correctly.

To fix the bug:
- We need to modify the `_convert_key` function so that it can handle non-integer indices with non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_types = [is_float, is_integer]
    key_type_check = [any(check(i) for check in index_types) for i in key]
    axis_types = [is_numeric_dtype(ax) for ax in self.obj.axes]

    for ax, i, is_numeric in zip(self.obj.axes, key, axis_types):
        key_is_integer = is_integer(i)
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not key_is_integer:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if key_is_integer and not is_numeric:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            if not key_type_check:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Indexers must be integers if index is non-numeric"
                )
    return key
```

The above code modifies the logic to handle non-integer indices with non-integer indexers by adding checks for numeric index types and the corresponding indexers. This change will enable the code to handle the cases indicated by the failing test and fix the bug.
