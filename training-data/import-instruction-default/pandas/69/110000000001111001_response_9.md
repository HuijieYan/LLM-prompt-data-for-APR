The bug in the function is caused by the `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` methods, which are not valid methods for the `Float64Index` type. This is causing a `AttributeError` in the function.

To fix the bug, we can check the type of the index (`ax`) and if it is `Float64Index`, we can use the `is_integer` function from the imported module. We can also replace `ax.holds_integer()` with `is_integer` to check if the index holds integers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index): 
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
