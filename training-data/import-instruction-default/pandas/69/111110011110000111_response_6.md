1. The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class. This class extends `_ScalarAccessIndexer` and is used for index-based operations in pandas. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is failing with the error `ValueError: At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`. This indicates that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for non-integer indexes in the `a.is_integer()` block.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to a ValueError when trying to access non-integer indexes with integer keys.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes.
   - Add a check to distinguish between integer and non-integer indexes, and handle them separately.

5. Corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_list_like(ax):
                if not is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        
        return key
```

This corrected code handles both integer and non-integer indexes properly and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
