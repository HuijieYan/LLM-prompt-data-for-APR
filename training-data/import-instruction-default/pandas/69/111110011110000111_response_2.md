### Analysis
The problematic function `_convert_key` is causing the error. It checks whether the index is an integer and raises a ValueError if the key is not an integer when it should be. This behavior is causing the failing test and the corresponding error message.

The function `_convert_key` is used within the `pandas.core.indexing._AtIndexer` class, as indicated in the error message. The failing test is testing the behavior of the function with different types of indexes, including `Float64Index`, and the error message provides the details of the failed test and the specific error that is being raised.

The GitHub issue provides additional context about the bug, indicating that Series lookups are affected for the `Float64Index` case, which is related to the failing test.

### Bug's Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case of non-integer indexes correctly, as evidenced by the error message raising a `ValueError` in that scenario.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly and not raise a `ValueError` in those cases.
2. Ensure that the function correctly processes different index types, including `Float64Index`, without raising errors.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on an {ax.dtype.type.__name__} index "
                        f"can only have {ax.dtype.type.__name__} indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected version of the `_convert_key` function now checks the type of the index and raises a `ValueError` with a specific message about the index type if the key is not of the same type. This should handle different index types, including `Float64Index` without raising errors.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
