The buggy function `_convert_key` seems to have an issue with the validation of index types. It is causing a ValueError to be raised when an index value is a float but is being compared with an integer index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if-else` block of the for loop. We need to compare the type of the index value `i` with the ax index type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version includes a comprehensive comparison between the index type and the type of the index value `i`.

This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing tests.
