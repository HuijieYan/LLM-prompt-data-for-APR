The potential error in the _convert_key function is in the section where it checks if the index is integer and then compares it to the key using the is_integer and holds_integer functions. The buggy code doesn't handle the case where the key is a float or non-integer numeric type, resulting in a ValueError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if the key is a float or non-integer numeric type when the index is not an integer index. This will ensure that the function correctly handles all types of keys and indexes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_numeric() and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we added an additional condition to the for loop that checks if the index is numeric and the key is not a numeric dtype. This ensures that the function now correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes with the appropriate type of indexers.

We recommend replacing the buggy function with this corrected version to fix the issue.
