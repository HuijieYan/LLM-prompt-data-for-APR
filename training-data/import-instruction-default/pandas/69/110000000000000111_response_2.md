1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing issues with series lookups for the `Float64Index` case, as indicated in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()`.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes in the `key` when using `At based indexing`. This is not properly validating the type of the index and the type of the indexer. This issue is causing problems in series lookups, especially for the `Float64Index` case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adding proper validation checks for the type of the index and the type of the indexer in the `key`.
   b. Handling the `is_setter` case more explicitly to avoid any ambiguity.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
