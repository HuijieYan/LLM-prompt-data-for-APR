The potential error in the provided function is that it checks the type of the index without ensuring that the index is a numeric type. This leads to incorrect error messages and behavior when the index is a Float64Index or an integer index. Since the function is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index, we need to check for numeric types before checking for integer types.

To fix the bug, we will modify the function to first check if the index is a numeric type before comparing the key's type with the index's type. Then, we will compare the key's type with the index's type accordingly. This will ensure that the function correctly handles non-integer and integer index types.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            elif not is_integer(i) and is_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function now properly handles different types of index (numeric and non-numeric), and correctly enforces that the keys must be of the same type as the index. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
