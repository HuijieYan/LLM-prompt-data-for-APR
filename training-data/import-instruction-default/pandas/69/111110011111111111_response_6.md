The bug in the `_convert_key` function lies in the part where it checks if the index is of type integer and then checks if the key is of type integer. The bug causes a ValueError to be raised when it shouldn't be in certain cases.

The issue is that the function does not handle cases where the key and the index are of different types, causing a ValueError to be raised when it shouldn't. This is evident from the failing test and error message which indicates that the function is not able to handle non-integer indexes and integer keyers properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of keys and indexes properly. We can achieve this by checking the type of the key and index and performing the validation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not is_float(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index"
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not is_sequence(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index"
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function will handle different types of indexes and keys properly, preventing the ValueError from being raised unnecessarily. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
