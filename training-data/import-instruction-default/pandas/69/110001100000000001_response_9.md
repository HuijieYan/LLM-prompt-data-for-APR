The potential error in the buggy function lies in the if-else conditions that check for the type of the index and the type of the key. It seems like the bug is caused by incorrect logic in handling the index and key types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of checking the index and key types and make sure that the function returns the correct type of key.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            raise ValueError("setter key must be a list-like")
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the logic for checking the index and key types. We are using the imported functions from the pandas library to check if the index and key are of the same type and return the correct type of key. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
