The bug in the code is that the function is not properly checking whether the key values are of the correct type given the index. The function relies on the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods of the index, but these methods are not sufficient to check the type of the key values.

The error message indicates that there is an issue when the key is a non-integer index and it is only meant to have non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check whether the key values are the same type as the index values. We can use the `is_numeric_dtype` function from pandas to check if the index is numeric and then compare the types of the index and the key values.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
        if not is_numeric_dtype(ax) and is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function properly checks if the key values match the type of the index, and raises a `ValueError` when they do not. This fixes the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
