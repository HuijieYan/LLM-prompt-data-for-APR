1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is used within the test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the indexing on non-integer indices, specifically related to the `ser.at[4]` statement.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the section where it checks if `ax.is_integer()` and then `is_integer(i)`. This check seems to be leading to the ValueError being raised when the code encounters `ser.at[4]` in the test.

3. Analysis:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` checks if the index axes are integer and then validates the index value based on that. If the axes are not integer, it should only allow non-integer indexers.
   (b). The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` shows that the `ser.at[4]` statement is raising a ValueError related to non-integer indexing.
   (c). The GitHub issue details that there is a bug affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic within `_convert_key` to correctly handle non-integer indexing based on the index axes type.
   - Ensure that the function correctly validates the index value based on the type of the index axes.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```
By using `is_numeric_dtype` to check for numeric index types and indexers, the corrected function now properly handles the validation of index values based on the type of the index axes.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
