Upon analysis, the bug is related to the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The failing test is related to `ser.at[4]` which is raising a ValueError due to the non-integer index.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to a ValueError being raised in specific scenarios.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. The fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.
