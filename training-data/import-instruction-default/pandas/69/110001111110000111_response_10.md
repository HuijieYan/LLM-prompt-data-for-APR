1. The buggy function _convert_key is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. It checks if the keys are of the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if they are not. The failing test is related to the use of this function in the code, and the error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly. The GitHub issue details that the bug impacts Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code that checks for integer and non-integer indexes. It seems that the condition for non-integer indexes is not being handled properly, leading to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of non-integer indexes in the _convert_key function. The failing test is trying to access values from a Series using non-integer keys, and the function is not handling this case properly, leading to a ValueError. The GitHub issue further clarifies that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditions for checking integer and non-integer indexes in the _convert_key function to ensure that non-integer indexes are handled correctly.
   - Adjusting the logic to differentiate between integer and non-integer indexes and convert the keys accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_type("integer"):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated code includes a change in the condition checking for non-integer indexes. Instead of checking both is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer(), it now simply checks for is_integer(i) when the index type is non-integer.

By using this corrected code, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
