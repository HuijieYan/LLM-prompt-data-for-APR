1. The buggy function _convert_key is a method within the class _AtIndexer. This function is responsible for converting the key into the same type as the index.

2. The potential error in the function is within the loop that iterates over the axes and compares the type of the index with the type of the key.

3. The bug is caused by a mismatch in the comparison of the index type and the key type. The function checks if the index is an integer and then compares it with the function is_integer(i), which is incorrect.

4. To fix the bug, we should check if the index is numeric using is_numeric_dtype and then compare it with the key using is_numeric_dtype as well.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we use the is_numeric_dtype function to check if the index and the key are of numeric type, which ensures that the comparison is accurate and fixes the bug.
