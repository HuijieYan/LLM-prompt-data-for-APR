The issue with the buggy function is that it is unable to handle both float and integer indexes correctly. In the failing test, the function is being called with an integer key, but the index is float. This causes the function to raise a ValueError in cases where an integer index can only have integer indexers.

In order to fix this bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to handle integer and float indexes separately. We can use the is_float and is_integer functions from the imported module to check the type of the index and the type of the key, and then raise a ValueError if the types don't match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(ax):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Index type not recognized"
            )
    
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the index and key are both of type float or integer, and raises a ValueError if there's a mismatch. If neither, it raises a ValueError for unrecognized index types, and returns the key otherwise. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.

Now, you can use this corrected version of the function as a drop-in replacement in your code.
