The `ValueError` is being raised in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is used to convert a given key to the same type as the index. The error is being raised due to the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():` within the `for` loop.

The cause of the bug is that when the condition `is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` is met, a `ValueError` is raised. The `is_integer` function is used to check if a value is an integer, and the `ax.holds_integer()` function is likely being used to check if the axis holds an integer. However, the condition should be checked using `is_numeric_dtype` to correctly identify whether the indexer is of a non-integer type.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition by replacing `is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` with `is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_integer(i)`. This will correctly check if the indexer `i` is numeric and not an integer, and only then raise a `ValueError`.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `ValueError` will no longer be raised and the function will work as expected.
