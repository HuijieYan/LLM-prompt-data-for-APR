Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional statements where it checks for the data type of the index.

Bug's Cause:
The buggy function is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. However, the conditional statements are not checking the data type correctly, resulting in potential ValueError being raised incorrectly.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the conditional statements correctly check the data type of the index and raise the ValueError only when the condition is not met.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i) != ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index " if ax.is_integer()
                    else "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have {} indexers".format(
                        "non-integer" if ax.holds_integer() else "integer"
                    )
                )
        return key
```

The corrected function now correctly checks the data type of the index and raises the ValueError only when the condition is not met. This fixed version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
