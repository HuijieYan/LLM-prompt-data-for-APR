The issue in the buggy function lies in the for loop, where we're trying to compare the types of the index with the input key. The function incorrectly checks if the axis is an integer and compares it to the key. However, it's more appropriate to check if the axis is of a numeric type and then compare it with the key. 

To fix this, we need to update the conditional checks for the axis and key and handle the comparison appropriately based on their types. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {ax.dtype} index "
                    "can only have indexers of the same type"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {ax.dtype} index "
                    "can only have indexers of the same type"
                )

    return key
```
With the corrected code, the function now correctly checks for the type of the axis and compares it with the type of the input key. This should resolve the issues with the buggy function and ensure that it meets the expected input/output variable information provided.
