The potential error in the code is likely in the for loop that iterates through the axes and keys, and checks the type of the elements.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is assuming `key` will be a tuple of integers or floats, and it is directly using the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods to check, causing a ValueError when the key is non-integer in the case of timestamp objects. The failing test is testing whether the indexer returns the expected values for both float and integer key.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle keys that are non-integer and non-float when the index is of datetime type.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_sequence(i):
            i = list(i)
        if not is_scalar(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing can only have scalar indexers"
            )
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
                
    return key
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
