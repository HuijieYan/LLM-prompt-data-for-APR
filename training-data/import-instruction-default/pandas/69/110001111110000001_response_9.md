The problematic function `_convert_key` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py` is used to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. In the failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py`, the error message indicates that the function is being instructed to raise a `ValueError` when using an integer index with non-integer indexers, and the condition check for `ax.is_integer()` in the loop probably triggers this error.

It appears that the function is incorrectly checking for the type of the keys and raising a `ValueError` when the type of the keys do not match the type of the index. This check is relevant when using integer indexers, but in this case (as observed from the failing test), it is not relevant.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to remove the check for integer indexers and instead, perform the type check to ensure that the key types match the index types only when necessary (e.g., when dealing with integer-based indices).

Here's the corrected function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, when necessary.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i) and type(ax) != pd.Float64Index:  # Additional type check
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    return key
```

By including an additional type check to ensure that the `key` is only of integer type when `ax` is a `pd.Float64Index`, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
