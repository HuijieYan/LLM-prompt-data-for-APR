The problematic function `_convert_key` is used for key conversion and type checking in the pandas module. The failing test for the `_convert_key` function in the `indexing.py` file is due to the comparison of integer keys with non-integer indexes, resulting in a `ValueError`.

The expected behavior is that the keys should be the same type as the index. The failing test parameters include datetime and timedelta objects and are used to test the behavior of `ser.at[4]`. The failing test returns a `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`.

To fix the issue, the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes needs to be corrected in the `_convert_key` function.

Fix:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(i) and is_integer(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
With this fix, the `_convert_key` function should handle the comparison of keys and indexes correctly, ensuring that the failing test is now passed.
