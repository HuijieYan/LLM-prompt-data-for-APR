The bug in the function seems to be with how it determines if the index is an integer type or not. The function is checking incorrectly if the index is an integer or not. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the index is float or not, not if it is an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float "
                    "index can only have non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
