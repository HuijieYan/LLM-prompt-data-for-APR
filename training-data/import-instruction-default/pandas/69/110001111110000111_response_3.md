The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `pandas.core.indexing` module and is used to convert keys for indexing. The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function when dealing with cases where the index is a `Float64Index`. It seems that there is a problem with the logic for handling non-integer indexers.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to access values from the series `ser` using various methods like `get_value`, `loc`, `at`, `iloc`, and `iat`. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` raised in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the block that handles non-integer indexers.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides additional context, stating that series lookups are affected for the case of `Float64Index`.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `_convert_key` function that handles non-integer indexers for `Float64Index`.

Taking into consideration the failing test and the issue description, the bug seems to stem from how non-integer indexers are being handled for `Float64Index`. It appears that the logic for dealing with non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function is incorrect, leading to the `ValueError`.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexers for `Float64Index`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        if is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles non-integer indexers for `Float64Index`, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
