The issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it does not handle non-integer keys properly. It raises a ValueError when it encounters a non-integer key, but this should only happen when the index is non-integer as well.

To fix this issue, we need to check whether the index is integer or non-integer before checking the type of the key. If the index is non-integer, then only we should raise an error if the key is an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
