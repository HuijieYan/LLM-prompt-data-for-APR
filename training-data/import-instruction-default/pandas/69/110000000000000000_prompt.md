Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


Please assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_numeric_dtype, is_scalar, is_sequence
```
