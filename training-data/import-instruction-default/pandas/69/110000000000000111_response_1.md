1. The buggy function is used to convert the key to the same type as the index. This is important for maintaining consistency in the indexing process. The GitHub issue indicates that there are corner cases in the `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` which affect series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that checks whether the index is an integer or not, and then checks the type of the key to ensure it matches the index type.

3. The potential bug cause could be that the function is not accurately handling the index type and the type of the key, thus leading to issues with series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the index type and key type with more robust conditions
   - Ensuring that the function handles corner cases with Float64Index and other index types correctly
   - Adding specific checks for Float64Index in the function logic.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_list_like(i) and not is_iterator(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have scalar, list-like, or iterator indexers"
                )
        elif is_integer(i):  # only check if the index is not numeric
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks for numeric index type, and if it is numeric, it allows scalar, list-like, or iterator indexers. If the index type is not numeric, it only allows non-integer indexers. This fix should address the corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value mentioned in the GitHub issue.
