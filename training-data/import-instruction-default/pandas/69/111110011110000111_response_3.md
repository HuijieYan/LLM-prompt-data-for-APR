The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, and it seems to be responsible for converting a key to the same type as the index. It checks if the key is an integer and if it matches the type of the index, and raises a ValueError if it doesn't.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` from the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is trying to perform various lookups on a Series with a Float64Index, which is failing due to the `_convert_key` function not handling non-integer indexes correctly.

The error message shows that the ValueError is being raised within the `_convert_key` function because non-integer indexes are not being handled properly.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are corner cases in the `get_value` function for DatetimeIndex and Float64Index that are causing issues, which is likely related to the problem with the `_convert_key` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes. It seems that the function is not correctly distinguishing between integer and non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(i):
            i = list(i)
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This modified code includes a check to handle non-integer index properly, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
