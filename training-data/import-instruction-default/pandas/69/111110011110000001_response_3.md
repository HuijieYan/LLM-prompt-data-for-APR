The `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class is currently raising a ValueError if the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` is met. This is causing the failing test to raise a ValueError when using `.at[4]`, as it doesn't align with the condition set in the `_convert_key` function, which is only allowing non-integer indexes to have non-integer indexers.

To fix this issue, the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` needs to be adjusted to allow integer indexes to have non-integer indexers if it's a float value. Additionally, for the .at accessor, the integer indexer should be cast to a float to match the behavior of .loc. With these adjustments, the failing test should pass.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index so we don't fallback
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i) and not (is_float(i) and is_integer(float(i))):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer or float indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
With these changes, the corrected `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle integer and non-integer indexers, and the failing test should pass.
