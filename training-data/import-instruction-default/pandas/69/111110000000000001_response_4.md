The potential error location within the problematic function is the "for" loop that iterates through self.obj.axes and key, checking the types of the index and the key elements.

The bug's cause is that the function fails to check if the key is an integer or not correctly. It assumes that if the axis is an integer, then the key must also be an integer, which is not necessarily true.

To fix the bug, we should check if the key is a scalar, or list-like. If it's a scalar, we can convert it to a list. Then, we can iterate through the axes and keys, and correctly check their types based on the axis properties.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            if is_scalar(key):
                key = [key]
            elif not is_list_like(key):
                raise ValueError("Must pass a list-like as a key")
        else:
            if is_scalar(key):
                key = [key]
            elif not is_list_like(key):
                raise ValueError("Must pass a list-like as a key")

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i):
                if not is_integer(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
By making the changes above, we can fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly.
