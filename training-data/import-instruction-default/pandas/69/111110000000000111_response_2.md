The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case. The issue suggests that there are corner cases affecting the `get_value` function for the Float64Index.

The potential error in the `_convert_key` function lies in the logic that checks for integer and non-integer indices. It seems that the logic is inconsistent and may not correctly handle the different index types.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to refactor the logic for checking the index types to ensure it covers all cases and handles Float64Index appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we have refactored the logic to check for numeric index types instead of integer-specific checks. This should address the issue with series lookups for the Float64Index case and also handle other numeric index types more consistently.
