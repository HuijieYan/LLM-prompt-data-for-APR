1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, and it is responsible for converting the keys to the same type as the index. The github issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" is related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking the type of index and key.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not properly checking the type of the index and key, leading to issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case. The issue on GitHub provides additional context about how the bug is affecting Series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly checking the type of the index for different scenarios.
   - Adding conditional checks to handle the Float64Index case.
   - Ensuring that the conversions of the keys are done accurately based on the type of the index.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # corrected version of the function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected version of the function now properly checks the type of the index and key, and specifically handles the Float64Index case. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
