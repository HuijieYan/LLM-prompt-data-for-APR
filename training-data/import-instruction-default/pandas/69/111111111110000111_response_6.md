The issue is related to the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. This function is used to convert the keys to the same type as the index, but it is failing for some corner cases, such as when using Float64Index.

The failing test is trying to use the `ser.at[4]` method, which calls the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the issue is related to handling non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes and indexers correctly. This is causing the ValueError to be raised when using `ser.at[4]`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes and indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Modified this block to handle non-integer indexers correctly
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The fix involves adding a check for non-integer indexers using the `is_float` function.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
