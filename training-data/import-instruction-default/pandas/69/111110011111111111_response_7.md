## 1. Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to be the same type as the index. It checks if the key is an integer and then raises a `ValueError` if it's not. The failing test is related to using the `at` method on a `Float64Index` with non-integer indexers.

## 2. Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the logic that checks if the key is an integer and raises an error if it's not.

## 3. Bug Cause
(a). The buggy function:
The logic inside the `_convert_key` function is raising a `ValueError` when the key is expected to be of a certain type.

(b). The buggy class:
The function is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is used for indexing operations.

(c). The failing test and error message:
The failing test checks the behavior of various indexing methods with `Float64Index` and non-integer indexers, which triggers the `ValueError` raised in the `_convert_key` function.

(d). Discrepancies:
The discrepancies lie in the behavior of the `_convert_key` function when dealing with non-integer indexers.

(e). GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue describes corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, indicating that there are specific scenarios causing issues with indexing.

## 4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
The issue can be resolved by modifying the logic within the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexers for `Float64Index` correctly. It might involve altering the conditional checks and error-raising conditions.

## 5. Corrected Code
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Type check for Float64Index
    if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.Float64Index):
        if is_integer(key) and not self.obj.index.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(key) and self.obj.index.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```
The corrected code includes additional checks for the type of index (`Float64Index`) and adjusts the error-raising conditions accordingly. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
