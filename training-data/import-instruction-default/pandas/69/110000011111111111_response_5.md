The bug is in the `_convert_key` function, where it fails to handle the conversion of keys properly when using `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods of the index. The failing test in `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` checks for the correct behavior of datetime and timedelta values but encounters errors due to improper handling of keys in the `_convert_key` function. The GitHub issue title and description indicate that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function does not properly handle the check for integer and non-integer indexes, leading to errors in handling keys.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to properly handle the check for integer and non-integer indexes by using the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function properly checks for numeric indexes and indexers, and handles the conversion of keys accordingly.

This corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
