1. The problematic function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is responsible for converting keys to be the same type as the index and it also handles arbitrary setting for the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check if the index is an integer type. 

3. The bug causes issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The problematic function `_convert_key` does not handle cases where the index is of type Float64Index properly, leading to incorrect behavior during lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditional statements to properly handle the case of a Float64Index.
   - Add additional checks to handle different index types and ensure proper type conversions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a list-like index "
                    "can only have list-like indexers"
                )
        elif is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Unsupported index type for the at-based indexing"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds additional checks to properly handle the case of different index types, such as list-like or numeric indexes, and ensures that the type conversions are handled appropriately.
