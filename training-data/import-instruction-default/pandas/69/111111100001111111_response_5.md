The potential error location within the problematic function is at the checking of the index type. The function is incorrectly checking for integer index type, when it should be checking for float index type.

The bug is caused by the code not correctly handling cases where the index is a float index (e.g., Float64Index) and the input key is a float or int. This causes the function to raise ValueError incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the cases where the index is a float index. We can do this by checking for the index type and then verifying if the input key matches the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_list_like(i) and not is_sequence(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now pass all the provided test cases and also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.

The corrected function correctly checks the type of the index and the input key to ensure they match, allowing for proper indexing on both numeric and non-numeric indices.
