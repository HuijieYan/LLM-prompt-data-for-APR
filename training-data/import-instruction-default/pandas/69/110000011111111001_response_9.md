The buggy function `_convert_key` is not handling different data types correctly. The bug is caused as the function is not treating the types of key and index axes accurately.

The issue is with the following part of the code:
```python
for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
    if ax.is_integer():
        if not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    else:
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
```
The 'ax.is_integer()' method and 'ax.holds_integer()' are not being used appropriately to check the type of the index axes.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
- Use the appropriate method to check the type of index axes, and utilize the 'is_integer', 'is_float', 'dtype' attributes present to check the type of 'i'.
- Remove the custom methods being used for type checks.
- Modify the condition checks to handle different data types correctly.
- Change the use of 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer' for type checks.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not (is_float(i) or is_integer(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not (is_float(i) or is_integer(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected function should handle different data types correctly and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
