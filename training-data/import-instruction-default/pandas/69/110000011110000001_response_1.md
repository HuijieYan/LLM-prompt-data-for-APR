The problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is failing when attempting to use the `ser.at[4]` method. The error message indicates that it is failing because "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The issue is that the function is incorrectly assuming that `is_integer(i)` is always the correct check for determining if `i` contains an integer value. However, the failing test clearly indicates that `ser.at[4]` is failing, which implies that `4` is not being correctly recognized as an integer value. This implies that the function is failing to recognize some integer values, causing the condition to be incorrectly triggered.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the condition `if is_integer(i)` with `if not is_integer(i)` in the `else` block. This will ensure that the condition is correctly triggered when `i` is not an integer, matching the behavior expected by the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `+_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account the correct check for identifying non-integer values when handling the `else` block of the code. This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test.
