Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition that checks if the axis is an integer using the method `ax.is_integer()`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the method `ax.is_integer()`. This method is not a valid method in the given context and is causing the condition to always evaluate to False, leading to incorrect validation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using `ax.is_integer()`, we can use the function `is_integer` from the imported module to check if the axis is an integer.
2. Replace the condition to correctly check if the axis is an integer and perform the necessary validation accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
