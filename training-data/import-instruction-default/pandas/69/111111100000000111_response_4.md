1. The buggy function '_convert_key' is part of the class '_AtIndexer', which is a subclass of '_ScalarAccessIndexer' and is used for indexing in the pandas library. The issue seems to be related to Series lookups for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for integer types and non-integer types within the for loop.

3. The bug's cause may be that the conditional checks for integer types and non-integer types are not handling the cases correctly, leading to incorrect behavior for Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the conditional checks for integer and non-integer types are performed correctly based on the index type.
   - Handle the cases for Float64Index specifically within the conditional checks.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            elif is_list_like(ax) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the conditional checks are performed based on whether the index is numeric or non-numeric, handling the cases for Float64Index specifically.
