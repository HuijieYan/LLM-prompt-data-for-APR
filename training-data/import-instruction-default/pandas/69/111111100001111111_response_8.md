The bug in the function `_convert_key` is caused by the incorrect handling of the key and index types when checking for integer values. The function is mistakenly assuming that all indexes will be of integer type, leading to incorrect type comparison errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when the index is of float or integer type, and the key is of a different type.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function to explicitly check for the type of the index and handle the key accordingly, rather than assuming the index type. This will ensure that the function correctly handles different types of indexes and keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_list_like(i) or is_iterator(i) or is_sequence(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the type comparison between the index and the key, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for different types of indexes and keys.

This fix should address the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
