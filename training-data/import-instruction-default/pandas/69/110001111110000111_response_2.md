Potential error location within the problematic function: The issue seems to be in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the section where it checks for integer indexers. It is not handling non-integer indexers properly, which leads to the ValueError being raised.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `_convert_key` function in the buggy file does not properly handle non-integer indexers, leading to a ValueError being raised.
(b). The failing test in the test file is trying to perform lookups on a float index, which triggers the issue.
(c). The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised due to non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function.
(d). The GitHub issue suggests that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Properly handle non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function to avoid the ValueError when performing lookups on a float index.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected code properly handles non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function, ensuring that the ValueError is not raised when performing lookups on a float index. This should address the bug and pass the failing test, as well as resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
