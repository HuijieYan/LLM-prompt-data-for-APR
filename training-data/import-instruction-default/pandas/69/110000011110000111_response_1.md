The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling the case where `is_integer(i)` returns False, which leads to a ValueError being raised. This is the source of the error message in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the non-integer index case. Specifically, when `ax.is_integer()` returns False, we need to check if `is_integer(i)` is also False, and if it's True, raise the ValueError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `is_integer(i)` condition handles the case properly, and the ValueError will be raised if needed. This fix should ensure that the failing test passes and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
