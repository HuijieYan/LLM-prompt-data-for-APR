The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling cases where the index is of type datetime or timedelta, and the key is a different type. The function is raising a ValueError in these cases, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle cases where the index is of type datetime or timedelta. This can be done by checking the dtype of the index and then appropriately converting the key to match the index type.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the dtype of the index and convert the key to the appropriate type if necessary. We also need to handle the case where the index is of type integer or non-integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
            
    return key
```

With this change, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle different types of indexes and keys, ensuring that the tests pass and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
