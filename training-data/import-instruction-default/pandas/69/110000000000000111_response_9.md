The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The issue affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `for` loop where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the key.

The bug's cause is the incorrect type checking in the for loop. The function is not properly handling the case where the index is of type integer and the key is of type non-integer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where the index and the key have different types. This can be done by checking the types of both index and key, and then performing appropriate actions based on their types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer, is_list_like

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax) and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(ax) and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
