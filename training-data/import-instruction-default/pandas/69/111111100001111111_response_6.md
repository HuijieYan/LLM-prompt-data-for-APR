The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for integer indexers, which is not properly handling float indexers.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling float indexers when checking for integer indexers in the series. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values for cases involving float indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle float indexers. Specifically, we need to check for float indexers and handle them appropriately in the conditionals that check for integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles float indexers in the conditionals, allowing for both integer and float indexers to be used appropriately. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
