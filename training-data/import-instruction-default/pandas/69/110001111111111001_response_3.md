Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, it appears that the issue lies in the `_convert_key` function. The function is checking if the index axis is an integer and then comparing whether the provided key is also an integer. This check is not appropriate, as the tests clearly show that the index can be of different types (`datatime64` or `timedelta64`) and not necessarily of the type `integer`. Also, the type of the key should be checked based on the dtype of the index.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to remove the checks for integer types and instead verify that the provided key is of the same dtype as the index. This can be done using the `is_scalar` function from the `pandas` library for checking scalar values, and `is_list_like` function for checking iterable values.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric():
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
