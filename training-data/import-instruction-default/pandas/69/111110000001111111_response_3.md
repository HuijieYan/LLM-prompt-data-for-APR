Potential error location: The bug seems to be originating from the `_convert_key` function, particularly in the section where it checks if the axis is an integer and the indexer is of the correct type.

Bug cause: The bug is caused by the incorrect type checking and comparison between the axis and indexer values within the `_convert_key` function. This causes issues with different types of indexers, such as float or integer, leading to unexpected behavior when performing lookups on series with Float64Index or other index types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the type checking logic to handle different index types and indexer types correctly.
2. Adjust the conditionals to correctly compare the types and handle each case appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):



    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        
        return key
```

This corrected code should handle the different cases for index and indexer types, ensuring that the comparisons are done correctly and that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
