# The bug is likely in the for loop where it checks whether the index is an integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if it doesn't match the axis type. The issue could be with the condition checking and validation of the index type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition checking and validation to ensure that it correctly handles the index type and axis type.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if hasattr(ax, 'is_integer') and ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and (not hasattr(ax, 'holds_integer') or not ax.holds_integer()):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The bug fix involves checking if the attribute is available (using hasattr) before calling the function and also modifying the condition checking to correctly handle the index type and axis type.
