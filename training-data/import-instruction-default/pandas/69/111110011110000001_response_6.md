The buggy function `_convert_key` is from the class `_AtIndexer`, and it is being used in the failing test function `test_lookups_datetimelike_values`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the code when non-integer indexes are used with integer indexers.

The code in the `_convert_key` function loops through the axes and keys and checks if it's an integer, and based on that it raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met. The error message clearly states that "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", which is consistent with the logic in the `_convert_key` function.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the conditions in the for loop to handle non-integer indexers for non-integer axes properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected function, the logic for handling non-integer indexers with non-integer axes is properly implemented. This should resolve the ValueError that was occurring in the failing test function.
