The potential error location in the problematic function is the conversion of the key in the `_convert_key` function. The function checks if the key is a setter and returns a list of the key if it is. Otherwise, it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the index is an integer or non-integer based on the type of the axis.

The bug's cause is that the function does not properly handle the case where the index is of type `datetime64` or `timedelta64`. This results in the function incorrectly raising a ValueError when checking the type of the index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle datetime and timedelta indices properly. We will update the logic to check for the type of the index and handle the comparison with the key accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
                if not isinstance(i, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                        "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the datatime and timedelta indices and ensures that the function behaves as expected for all types of indices. The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
