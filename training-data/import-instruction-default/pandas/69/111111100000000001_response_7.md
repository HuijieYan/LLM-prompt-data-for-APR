The potential error in the provided function is in the logic that checks if the indexes are of the same type as the index and the indexers. The function tries to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but the conditions in the if-else block are not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `key` is an instance of a list-like object and convert it to a list if it is an iterable object. Additionally, we need to check if the key and the index are of the same type and handle the integer and non-integer index cases separately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        # convert key to list if it is iterable
        key = list(key) if is_iterator(key) else [key]

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_sequence(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return list(key)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `is_setter` is true and convert `key` to a list if it is an iterator. We then iterate through the axes and key and check if they are of the same type, handling the numeric and non-numeric index cases separately. The corrected code ensures that the keys are of the same type as the index and follows the correct logic for type checking.
