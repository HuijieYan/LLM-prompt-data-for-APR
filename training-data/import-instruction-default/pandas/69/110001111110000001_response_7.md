The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key into the same type as the index. It checks if the key and the index have the same type and throws a ValueError if they do not. The failing test is trying to use `_convert_key` when trying to retrieve a value using the `at` attribute (`result = ser.at[4]`).

The error message clearly states that the issue is caused by the function not handling non-integer indexing properly. The error is being raised on line 2128 of the `indexing.py` file, within the `_convert_key` function. The code is not handling non-integer indexing when the index is converted to float64.

To fix this issue, we can update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexing when the index is converted to float64. The corrections include properly checking the type of the value in the key and casting it to the same type as the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    key_type = type(key)
    index_type = type(self.obj.index)

    # Handle non-integer indexing when the index is converted to float64
    if is_float(self.obj.index) and not is_float(key):
        if is_sequence(key):
            key = [index_type(i) for i in key]
        else:
            key = index_type(key)

    if not isinstance(key, index_type):
        raise ValueError(f"The key must be of type {index_type}")

    return key
```

This corrected version of the function checks the type of the index and key and properly handles non-integer indexing when the index is converted to float64. It also ensures that the key is of the same type as the index, and if not, it raises a ValueError.

This corrected implementation should resolve the issues raised by the failing test and the corresponding error message. It will handle non-integer indexing when the index is converted to float64, ensuring that the `_convert_key` function works correctly.
