The buggy function `_convert_key` is not handling the cases where the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float or integer value. This is causing the test cases to fail and leading to a ValueError.

The problem lies in the conditional check where it raises a ValueError if `is_integer(i)` and `not ax.holds_integer()`.

The failing tests are caused when the key is a float or integer value and the index is either a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex converted to a Float64Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to correctly handle the cases where the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float or integer value.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the conditional check to handle the cases where the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float or integer value. We can check if the index is a Float64Index and then use `is_float(i)` instead of `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)`.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a list-like index "
                    "can only have list-like indexers"
                )
        elif is_float(ax):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

Using this corrected version of the `_convert_key` function should resolve the failing tests and the issue posted on GitHub. The modified function now handles the cases where the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float or integer value, ensuring that the correct type of indexers are used for based indexing.
