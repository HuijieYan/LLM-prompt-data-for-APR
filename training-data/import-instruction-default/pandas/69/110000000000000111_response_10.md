The buggy function `_convert_key` is related to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTl.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The issue specifically mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which indicates that the bug is related to indexing and lookup operations on a float index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that checks the type of the index and the type of the key. This is where the function is determining whether the key matches the type of the index and throwing a ValueError if it does not.

The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the case of a Float64Index properly, leading to incorrect behavior during lookup operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking for the specific type of index (Float64Index) and handling it differently than other types of indexes
- Adjusting the logic for checking the type of the index and the type of the key

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(ax):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_list_like(i):
                for val in i:
                    if not is_numeric_dtype(val):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on a non-integer/float index "
                            "can only have non-integer/float indexers"
                        )
            else:
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer/float index "
                        "can only have non-integer/float indexers"
                    )

    return key
```

This corrected code handles different types of indexes (integer, float, non-integer/float) and their respective indexers properly, and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
