After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it can be observed that the issue lies in the `_convert_key` function. The function is checking if the index is integer based and then raises a `ValueError` if the key does not match the type. However, the bug is that the function should also consider float type in addition to integer type in the checks.

The potential error location is in the type checking logic inside the `_convert_key` function.

In order to fix the bug, the type checking logic needs to be modified to also consider float types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)):  # Also check for float type
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"  # Update the error message
                )
        else:
            if (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function now considers both integer and float types in the key and appropriately raises an error if the types do not match the index.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
