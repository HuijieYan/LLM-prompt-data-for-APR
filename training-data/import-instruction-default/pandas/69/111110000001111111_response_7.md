Potential error location: The potential error within the function lies in the condition for checking if the index is an integer when iterating through the axes.

Bug cause: The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the _convert_key function. The function incorrectly checks whether the index is an integer, and if it is, it then checks if the key is an integer. This logic is flawed as it does not consider cases where the index is not an integer.

Additionally, the GitHub issue indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, suggesting that there is a broader issue with the Float64Index lookups in the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the check for whether the index is an integer and the subsequent checks for the key being an integer or not. Instead, focus on validating the key based on the type of index directly.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the Float64Index case for Series lookups.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError("At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers")
            elif isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError("At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex can only have numeric indexers")
    
        return key
```

The corrected code removes the flawed checks for integer index and key, and instead focuses on validating the key based on the type of index directly. Additionally, it includes specific checks for Float64Index and DatetimeIndex cases to ensure correct handling for these types of indexes.
