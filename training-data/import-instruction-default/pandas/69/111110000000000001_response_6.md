1. The buggy function is part of the `_AtIndexer` class and is used to convert a key for indexing. The function checks if the key is a setter (i.e., used for setting values), and if so, it converts the key into a list. Otherwise, it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the key matches the types of the axes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the key matches the types of the axes.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling cases where the key does not match the types of the axes, leading to potential errors when using non-matching keys for indexing. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors in the functionality of the class.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to ensure that the key length matches the number of axes in the object.
   - Checking the type of the key and the axis and handling the cases where they do not match.
   - Adjusting the conditions for raising ValueError to more accurately reflect the problematic cases.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes):
            raise ValueError("Key length does not match the number of axes")

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_numeric():
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
