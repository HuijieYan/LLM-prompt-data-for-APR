The issue with the given code is that the function is not correctly checking if the key matches the index type and is only checking if it's an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the _convert_key function to properly check if the key matches the index type for the entire series.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return tuple(key) if is_sequence(key) else key
```
This corrected code should now correctly check if the key matches the index type for the entire series, as expected in both the provided and expected cases.
