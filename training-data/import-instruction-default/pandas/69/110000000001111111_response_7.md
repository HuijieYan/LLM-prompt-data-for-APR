The potential error in the buggy function seems to be the checks for the type of the index and the type of the key. The function checks whether the index is an integer index and then checks if the key is also an integer, but it does not handle the case where the index is not an integer index. In the case where self.obj is a Series with a datetime index or a timedelta index, the function should not raise any errors if the key is a float or an integer, since float and integer keys are also valid for non-integer indices.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that lookups in Series are affected for the Float64Index case, indicating that there might be a bug related to lookups in Series with a Float64Index.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where the index is not an integer index. It should only raise an error if the index is an integer index and the key is not an integer.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_numeric():
            continue
        else:
            if is_sequence(i) and len(i) == 1:
                i = i[0]
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have scalar indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code modifies the else block to handle cases where the index is not an integer index. It checks if the index is numeric, and if it is, it skips the check and continues to the next iteration. If the index is not numeric, it checks if the key is a sequence with a length of 1 and then converts it to a scalar before checking if it is a valid index.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in GitHub by correctly handling lookups in Series with a Float64Index.
