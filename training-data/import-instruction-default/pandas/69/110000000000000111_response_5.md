1. The buggy function is a method called _convert_key within a larger object, and it is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The GitHub issue mentions corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, indicating that there are issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. This suggests that the problematic function may be used in these lookups and could be causing the bugs.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check for integer type and non-integer type. These conditional statements may not be accurately identifying the type of index and key, leading to potential errors in lookups.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the conditional checks not accurately identifying the types of the index and key, leading to incorrect behavior during lookups. The GitHub issue mentioning affected lookups for the Float64Index case suggests that the bug is related to the handling of float indexes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the conditional checks to ensure they accurately identify the types of the index and key
   - Checking how float indexes are handled and ensuring correct behavior for the Float64Index case
   - Testing the function with different index and key types to identify and resolve any discrepancies

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been adjusted to use the is_numeric_dtype function to accurately identify the types of the index and key. This should resolve the issues related to lookups for the Float64Index case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
