1. The function is designed to convert keys to the same type as the index. However, there are several potential issues in the function that need to be addressed, such as incorrect method calls and missing imports.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that checks whether the index is an integer and whether the key is also an integer. The use of `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)` may not be valid method calls.

3. The bug's cause is due to incorrect method calls and incorrect logic used to check the type of the index and key.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correcting the method calls to use the appropriate functions from the imported modules.
   - Revising the logic to accurately check the type of the index and key.

5. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype, is_float_dtype
    
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer_dtype(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer_dtype(i) and not is_float_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
- The necessary imports have been added to use the appropriate functions for type checking.
- The method calls have been replaced with the correct functions for type checking.
