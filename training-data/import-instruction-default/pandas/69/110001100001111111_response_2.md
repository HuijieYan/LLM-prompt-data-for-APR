### Bug Analysis

The bug in the `_convert_key` function seems to be related to the comparison of index types and the types of the keys provided. The function is trying to enforce constraints on the types of keys that can be used for indexing, but the logic seems to be incorrect.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the way the function compares the type of the index with the type of the keys. The function is incorrectly comparing the index type with the type of the keys without considering the type of the data within the index.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that the bug is affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case. This aligns with the observation that the function is comparing the data types of the index and the keys in an incorrect manner.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug appears to be that the function is not considering the data type within the index when comparing it with the type of keys. It is incorrectly assuming that a Float64Index can only be used with floating point keys, but this assumption is incorrect.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to consider the data type within the index when comparing it with the type of keys. Additionally, it needs to handle different types of index and keys appropriately to allow for correct indexing.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError("Indexing with non-integer scalar key on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif not is_numeric_dtype(ax) and is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError("Indexing with an integer key on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

The corrected code includes checks for different types of indexes and keys, ensuring that the indexing operations are performed correctly based on the data type within the index and the type of the keys. This code should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
