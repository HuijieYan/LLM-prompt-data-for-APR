The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer` from the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is responsible for converting the key based on specific conditions and raising a ValueError if the conditions are not met.

The error message indicates that the issue lies within the block that checks for whether the index is an integer or holds an integer. The condition `if ax.is_integer()` is likely not working as intended, leading to the ValueError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking whether the index is an integer or holds an integer needs to be modified.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for checking integer indices and non-integer indices.
2. Check if the issue is with the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:
```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
This corrected version includes a check for `pd.Float64Index` and `is_float` to handle non-integer indices. It also changes the condition for checking non-integer indexes. This should address the issue and prevent the ValueError from being incorrectly raised.
