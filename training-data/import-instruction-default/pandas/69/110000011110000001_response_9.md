The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `_convert_key` function in the pandas core indexing module. Specifically, the error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" when trying to access the value at index 4. This suggests that the issue lies in the handling of non-integer indices in the `_convert_key` function.

The bug is caused by improper handling of non-integer indices in the `_convert_key` function. It is failing to handle non-integer indices properly and raising a ValueError when it should be handling the non-integer indices gracefully.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indices. The function should not raise a ValueError when encountering non-integer indices, and it should handle them gracefully.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test case should pass successfully.
