The bug in the function is caused by the use of ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer(). Since the ax variable is an instance of Float64Index, these methods should be used to check the type of the index, and not to check individual elements.

To fix the bug, we need to replace ax.is_integer() with is_integer(ax) and ax.holds_integer() with holds_integer(ax).

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_list_like(i) and not is_iterator(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(ax) and not holds_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This code should now pass all the provided test cases.
