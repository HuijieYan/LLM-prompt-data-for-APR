The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function, where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the key for the given index. In some cases, it throws a ValueError when it shouldn't.

The issue is identified by the failing test in the error message, wherein the function raises a ValueError incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly raises a ValueError for non-integer indexes when it should be allowed in certain cases, as evident from the failing test and the expected input/output variable information. This behavior is causing the failing test to fail, and it is also the reason for the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be updated to allow non-integer indexes in certain cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not (is_float(i) or is_integer(i)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function will now handle non-integer indexes correctly and allow non-integer indexers in certain cases. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
