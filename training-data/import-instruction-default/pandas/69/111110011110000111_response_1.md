The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing the error. This function is called when performing at-based indexing on a non-integer index, and it checks whether the index and the key have the same type.

The failing test is related to the use of at-based indexing with a non-integer index. This test is demonstrating that the current implementation of `_convert_key` is not correctly handling at-based indexing on a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug is related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which is consistent with the failing test scenario.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle at-based indexing on a non-integer index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this corrected version of the `_convert_key` function, the at-based indexing on non-integer indexes will be handled correctly, and the failing test should now pass. This also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.
