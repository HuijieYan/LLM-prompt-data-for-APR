The potential error in the buggy function is within the for loop when checking the type of index and the type of the indexer. The bug causes a ValueError to be raised incorrectly due to the conditions being checked.

To fix the bug, we can use the isinstance() function to check if the indexer is of the correct type. We can also streamline the conditional checks to make the code more concise and easier to understand.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly check the types of the index and the indexer and raise a ValueError if they do not match as intended.
