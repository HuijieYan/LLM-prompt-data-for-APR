The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for ensuring that keys are of the same type as the index. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the check for integer and non-integer indexes within the function.

The failing test is related to lookups for datetime64 and timedelta64 values. It seems that the function is not handling these specific cases properly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides additional context that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing test and error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include revisiting the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes, as well as handling specific cases for datetime64 and timedelta64 values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to handle both numeric and non-numeric indexes properly, including the specific cases for datetime64 and timedelta64 values, and should pass the failing test while resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
