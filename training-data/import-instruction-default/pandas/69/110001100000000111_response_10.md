# The corrected function
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        return key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax) and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif is_float(ax) and not is_float(i):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This bug is related to the `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` functions, and it affects the Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The potential error location within the buggy function is the if-else conditions checking for integer and float types.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the functions to check for types (is_integer and is_float) and the incorrect comparison logic within the if-else conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to use the functions `is_integer` and `is_float` from the imported module to check for integer and float types respectively. We also need to correct the comparison logic in the if-else conditions to ensure the appropriate error messages are raised for the specific cases.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided above, which includes the corrected usage of `is_integer` and `is_float` functions, along with corrected comparison logic in the if-else conditions. This code resolves the issue posted in GitHub by correctly handling the cases for integer and float indexers.
