The potential error in the buggy function lies within the for loop that iterates through the obj.axes and key. There is a mismatch between the condition checks and the associated actions within the loop.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index type matches the key type for all axes.
2. If the axis is an integer type, then the key should also be an integer.
3. If the axis is a non-integer type, then the key should also be a non-integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # Corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # Allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i):  # Check if the key is an integer
                if not ax.is_integer():  # If the axis is not integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer():  # If the axis is integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for checking the types of the index and key have been adjusted to ensure proper matching. This fixed version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
