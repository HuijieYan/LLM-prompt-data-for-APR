The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling cases where the index type is not a float. The function must handle both float and non-float indexes and check whether the key values are of the same type as the index.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to handle both float and non-float indexes and check whether the key values are of the same type as the index, instead of just handling the float case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_float(ax):
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an float index "
                        "can only have float indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-float "
                        "index can only have non-float "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected function handles both float and non-float indexes and checks whether the key values are of the same type as the index. It addresses the issues identified in the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
