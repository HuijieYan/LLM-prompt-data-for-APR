1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the pandas library and is used to convert keys for indexing purposes. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of the `get_value`, `__getitem__`, `__getattr__`, and `__repr__` operations when used with datetime and timedelta values.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is in the `else` clause where a `ValueError` is raised if certain conditions are met.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly, leading to a `ValueError` being raised. This is reflected in the failing test and the error message, as well as in the GitHub issue which highlights corner cases in the `get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` operations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexers, ensuring that the function does not raise a `ValueError` in these cases.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_number(i):
                raise TypeError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code modifies the logic within the `else` clause to check for non-integer indexers using the `is_scalar` and `is_number` functions, and raises a `TypeError` if the conditions are not met. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
