The root cause of the bug is in the `_convert_key` function, where it fails to correctly handle cases where the index is float and non-integer. This leads to failed tests in cases where `is_setter` is `False` and the key is a float.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle cases where the index is float and non-integer. Specifically, we need to ensure that when `ax` is non-integer, the function allows non-integer indexers.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i):
            i = int(i)  # convert float to integer if it's a whole number
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i) and not is_list_like(i) and not is_iterator(i):
                i = float(i)  # convert non-float to float
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now handle cases with float and non-integer indexes correctly and the failing tests should pass.

This revised function satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value."
