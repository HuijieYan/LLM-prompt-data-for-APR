The issue in the function appears to be with the checks for integer type and non-integer type in the input key. The function is not correctly handling the distinction between float and integer type values. This is causing the function to raise ValueError incorrectly in some cases.

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that the bug is related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not properly handling the type checking for float and integer values in the input key, leading to incorrect ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the distinction between float and integer type values in the input key. This can be done by using the `is_integer` and `is_float` functions from the pandas library to perform type checking.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            elif is_float(i) and not is_float(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the distinction between float and integer type values in the input key, and should satisfy all the provided test cases.
