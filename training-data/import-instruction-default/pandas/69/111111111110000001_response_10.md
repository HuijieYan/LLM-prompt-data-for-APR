The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The error message indicates that a ValueError is raised, stating "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This suggests that there is an issue with the indexing based on non-integer values.

The `_convert_key` function is responsible for validating the keys for indexing and ensuring they are of the same type as the index. The error message occurs when checking for non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the condition check for non-integer indexers. This should involve handling the case when the indexer is not an integer but the axis is expecting an integer. The correction should ensure that appropriate checks are in place to handle both integer and non-integer indexers based on the axis type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional checks to ensure that non-integer indexers are appropriately handled based on the type of the axis. These checks should allow the function to pass the failing test without raising a ValueError.
