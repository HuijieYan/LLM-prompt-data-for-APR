1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting a key based on the index type. The function checks whether the key is a setter and if so, converts it to a list. Then, it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the index is an integer. Depending on the index type, it raises a ValueError if the key does not match the index type.

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with the `get_value` method for the Float64Index case, which is likely related to the type checking and conversion performed by the `_convert_key` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks the type of the index and compares it with the type of the key.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the type checking logic within the `_convert_key` function. The `get_value` method is affected for the Float64Index case, indicating that the type checking and conversion performed by `_convert_key` may not be handling the Float64Index case correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Updating the type checking and conversion logic in `_convert_key` to handle the Float64Index case correctly.
   - Adding specific checks and conversions for the Float64Index type.
   - Refactoring the type checking and conversion logic to be more robust and handle all index types appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function includes updated type checking using the `is_numeric_dtype` function and handles both the numeric and non-numeric index cases appropriately. This should address the issues reported in the GitHub bug.
