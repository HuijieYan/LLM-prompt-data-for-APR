Potential Error Location: The buggy function may encounter errors when checking the type of the index and the type of the key.

Bug Cause: The function is mistakenly checking if the index is an integer using the `is_integer()` method, which does not exist. Additionally, there is a potential error in the logic for checking the type of the key.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Use `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions to check whether the index is an integer or holds an integer.
2. Additionally, use the provided import functions to check the type of the key.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax) or holds_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not holds_integer(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
