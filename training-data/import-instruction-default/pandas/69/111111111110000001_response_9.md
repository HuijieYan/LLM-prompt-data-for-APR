The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. It iterates over the axes of the object and checks if the index is an integer, and if it is, it verifies if the key is also an integer. If the index is not an integer, it checks if the key is not an integer as well. However, the issue arises because the function `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` utilize the `is_integer` function from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` module. This function does not work as intended and hence, the key checking logic is flawed.

The error occurs when the function raises the ValueError because it expects the key `4` to be a float since it is being passed into the `.at` accessor, but it's not checking the type correctly and evaluating to an integer which triggers the exception being raised.

To fix this issue, the key checking logic needs to be improved to correctly determine if the key should be an integer based on the type of the index. This can be done by using the `is_numeric_dtype` function from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` module to check if the index is a numeric data type and then compare the type of the key accordingly.

The corrected function is as follows:
```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.indexing import _AtIndexer
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_numeric_dtype, is_scalar, is_sequence

class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_scalar(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_scalar(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key

```

This corrected function checks whether the index is of a numeric type using the `is_numeric_dtype` function. If it is, it enforces that the key also be a numeric type, and vice versa. This should address the issues observed in the failing test and error message.
