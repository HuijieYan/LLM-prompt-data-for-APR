Buggy function:

The buggy function `_convert_key` in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file is causing the issue. It is responsible for handling keys and ensuring that they are the same type as the index.

Error Location:

The error location is identified in the following block of code within the `_convert_key` function:

```python
else:
    if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
        raise ValueError(
            "At based indexing on an non-integer "
            "index can only have non-integer "
            "indexers"
        )
```

Bug's Cause:

The bug is caused by the conditional check for non-integer indexers. This check is producing incorrect results, leading to the ValueError being raised when it shouldn't.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Correct the conditional check for non-integer indexers to ensure it is accurately identifying non-integer indexers.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code checks for non-numeric indexers instead of non-integer indexers. This will handle non-integer indexers as well as other non-numeric indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
