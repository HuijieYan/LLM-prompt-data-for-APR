The bug in the `_convert_key` function seems to be caused by not handling non-integer index types correctly. The function is supposed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but it's not handling non-integer index types properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle non-integer index types by checking if the index is numeric and then checking if the key is of the same type as the index.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have scalar or list-like indexers"
                )
            if is_list_like(i):
                if not is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                        "can only have sequence-like indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if not type(i) == type(ax[0]):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing requires the indexer type to be the same as the index type"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function includes checks for both numeric and non-integer index types. It also handles the case where the key is a list-like object. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
