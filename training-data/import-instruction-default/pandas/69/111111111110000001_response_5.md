The `_convert_key` function is expecting the index to be an integer, but in the failing test, the index is of type float64. This results in the ValueError being raised because the function is checking for integer indexers instead of float indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class to check for float indexers if the axis is not an integer.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the condition inside the for loop to check for float indexers when the axis is not an integer. This would allow the function to handle both integer and float indexers based on the axis type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle float indexers when needed and should pass the failing test.
