The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the index type and the type of the key in the `_convert_key` function. The function is meant to ensure that the type of the key matches the type of the index. However, the current implementation is not handling non-integer types properly.

Upon analyzing the input/output variable information, it is evident that the function is failing when the index type is a float or timedelta, and the key is also a float or int. This is causing the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly.

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that these corner cases are causing problems in Series lookups for Float64Index. This aligns with the observation from the failing tests, where the function fails for Float64Index type indices.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the comparison of the key type with the index type. The function should check if the index is of integer type and then verify if the key is also of integer type. If the index is not of integer type, then the key should not be of integer type either. This logic needs to be implemented properly in the function to address the issue.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype.type
    for i in key:
        if is_numeric_dtype(index_type):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(type(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        elif is_sequence(i) and not is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                "index can only have non-numeric "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly checking the type of the index and the key, and raising an error only if there is a mismatch in the types. This ensures that the function works correctly for both integer and non-integer index types.
