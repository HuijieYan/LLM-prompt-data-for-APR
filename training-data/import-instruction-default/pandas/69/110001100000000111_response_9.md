The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the file `pandas/core/indexing.py` and is related to the issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" on GitHub. The issue affects series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop where it checks the index type and the indexers being used. There are issues with the logic that checks for integer indexers and non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the cases where the index is of type 'float' and the key is of type 'integer' or 'float'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the loop where it checks the index type and the indexers being used. We need to add proper checks and conditions for handling float and integer type indexes and indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i) and not is_float(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not is_integer(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function checks for both float and integer types for the index and the indexers, and raises appropriate ValueError if there is a mismatch. This resolves the issue on GitHub titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
