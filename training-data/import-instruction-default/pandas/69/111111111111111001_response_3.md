The issue in the `_convert_key` function is that it's not correctly handling keys that are not integers when the index is not an integer index. It's not correctly raising an error when necessary, leading to incorrect behavior in the tests.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer keys when the index is not an integer index.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and (not is_scalar(i) or is_string_like(i)):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                i = [i]

            if not is_list_like(ax) and len(i) == 1:
                # GH#29927 scalar -> scalar, and legacy checks
                i = i[0]

            if len(ax) and not ax.equals(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected implementation should address the issues identified and should now correctly handle non-integer keys when the index is not an integer index.

With this fix, the `_convert_key` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
