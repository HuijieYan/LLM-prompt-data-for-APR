The `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class has a bug that causes a `ValueError` to be raised when trying to access a non-integer index. The function loops through the axes of the object and checks if the index is an integer, then compares it with the input key. The bug occurs because it incorrectly handles the case when the index is non-integer.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes. Specifically, when the index is non-integer, it should not raise an error when the input key is an integer.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is shown below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `ValueError` should no longer be raised when accessing non-integer indexes.

The corrected `__convert_key` function provided above can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function in the `_AtIndexer` class. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue with the `ValueError` being raised when attempting to access non-integer indexes.
