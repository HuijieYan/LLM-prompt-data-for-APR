Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the function `_convert_key` is related to the comparison of the key with the index. The function expects the keys to be the same type as the index, but the implementation is not handling cases for floating point and integer indexes correctly.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect type comparison and checks within the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the type checks for the index and the keys. Additionally, it needs to handle the case where the index is of type float or integer.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the type comparison logic in the function, specifically in the parts where it checks for integer and non-integer indexes. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the index is a floating point index.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_float(i) and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
        elif is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks for the type of the index and keys, handling both integer and floating point index cases as well as non-integer indexes.

This corrected code should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
