The buggy function is `_convert_key` and it is related to the `pandas.core.indexing` class and the failing test from the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file.

The potential error location is within the for loop inside the `_convert_key` function that checks if the key is an integer. It then raises a `ValueError` if the condition is not met.

The bug is caused because this function does not handle the case where the input is a float, which is causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the for loop to check for either integer or float and handle both cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_sequence(i) and not ax.is_all_dates:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code will now correctly handle both integer and float keys. It has been extended to include checks for float data types using `is_float(i)` and `is_sequence(i)` from the provided imports.
