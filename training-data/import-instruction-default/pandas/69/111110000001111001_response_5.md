Potential error location: The bug is caused by the function not handling the case when the index is not of the type float or integer, and therefore not validating the type of the key appropriately.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and validate the type of key accordingly.
2. Add a condition to handle non-integer or non-float indexes.

# The corrected code for the problematic function
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.Int64Index)):
                if not (isinstance(i, (float, int)) and not isinstance(i, bool)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not (isinstance(i, (float, int)) and not isinstance(i, bool)):
                    raise ValueError(
