The issue in the buggy function lies in the `_convert_key` method. It incorrectly raises a ValueError when the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. This is causing the failing tests as it's not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` method does not handle non-integer indexes and integer keys appropriately, leading to a ValueError being raised in these cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle non-integer indexes and integer keys properly. We can achieve this by updating the conditional checks within the function to correctly handle both integer and non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated version of the function handles both numeric and non-numeric indexes appropriately, ensuring that the keys match the index type. This should resolve the failing tests and the issue reported on GitHub.

By using the above corrected version of the `_convert_key` method, the failing tests should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected and handles different types of indexes and keys correctly.
