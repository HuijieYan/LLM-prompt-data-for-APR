The potential error location in the problematic function is in the for loop where the logic checks whether the index and the key have the same type.

The bug's cause is that there is a mismatch between the type of the index and the type of the key being passed into the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key has the same type as the index. If the key is a setter, we should allow arbitrary setting and return the key as a list. Otherwise, we should check the type of the index and the key and raise a ValueError if there is a mismatch.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError("Numeric indexing can only have numeric indexers")
            elif is_list_like(ax):
                if not is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError("List-like indexing can only have list-like indexers")
            elif is_iterator(ax):
                if not is_iterator(i):
                    raise ValueError("Iterator indexing can only have iterator indexers")
            else:
                if not type(ax) == type(i):
                    raise ValueError(f"Indexing can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers")
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we use the pandas functions is_numeric_dtype, is_list_like, and is_iterator to check the types of the index and the key. If there is a mismatch, we raise a ValueError with an appropriate message. We also check for the data type of the index and key, and if they are not matching, we raise a ValueError. This ensures that the key has the same type as the index.
