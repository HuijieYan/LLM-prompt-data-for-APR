The buggy function is responsible for converting keys and checking their compatibility with the index. The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes how series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition used to check if the axis is an integer, and the subsequent check for a non-integer index.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in the condition used to check if the axis is an integer, leading to incorrect validation of the index types.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic used to check the index types by using the available functions from the imported libraries to accurately determine the type of the index and the key.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code uses the `is_numeric_dtype` function from the imported libraries to accurately determine the type of the index and the key, and then raises the appropriate ValueError based on the type mismatch. This fix should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
