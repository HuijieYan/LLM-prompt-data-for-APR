Here's the fixed version of the function with corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a {ax.dtype} index "
                    f"can only have {ax.dtype} indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a {ax.dtype} "
                    f"index can only have non-numeric "
                    f"indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The potential error location within the original problematic function is the logic that checks whether the index is an integer before checking the index type.

The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly handling the data types of the index and the key by not following the correct logic for checking if the key type is the same as the index type, as per the failing test and error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Revising the conditional statements to properly handle different data types of the index and key.
- Using the function `pandas.core.dtypes.common.is_numeric_dtype` to check for numeric data types instead of directly using `is_integer`.

The corrected code makes use of the `is_numeric_dtype` function to check the data type of the index and key, and raises appropriate exceptions based on the data types, ensuring that the key type matches the index type as required by the failing test.
