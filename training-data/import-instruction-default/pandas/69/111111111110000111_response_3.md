The bug is causing a ValueError in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This bug is related to the behavior of `get_value` in the `Float64Index` case as indicated by the failing test and error message.

The `_convert_key` function is checking if the index is an integer, and if so, it ensures that the key is also an integer. However, when the index is not an integer, it should check that the key is not an integer. This creates a discrepancy for non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this, the `_convert_key` function should correctly handle non-integer indexes when checking the key. It should raise a ValueError if the index is an integer and the key is not, and vice versa.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) or is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks the type of the index and the key, and raises a ValueError if there is a mismatch. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
