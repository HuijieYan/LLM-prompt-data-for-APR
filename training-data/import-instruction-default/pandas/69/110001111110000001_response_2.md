Upon analyzing the error message, it seems that the bug is within the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file, as indicated by the error message `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`. The failing test function `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` calls the `_convert_key` function and encounters an issue with non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the `_convert_key` function does not handle non-integer indexers correctly when used in certain contexts, as indicated by the failing test and the error message. It seems that the function should perform a check for non-integer indexers and handle it appropriately.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexers. This may involve checking the type of indexers and performing the necessary operations to accommodate non-integer indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            i = ax._convert_scalar_indexer(i)
        else:
            if is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {ax.__class__.__name__} index "
                    f"can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            i = ax._convert_listlike_indexer(i, kind="loc")

    return key
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle non-integer indexers, as suggested by the failing test case and the error message. It performs appropriate type checks and conversion for the indexers.
