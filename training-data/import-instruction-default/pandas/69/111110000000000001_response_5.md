The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates over the axes and checks the type of the index.

The bug is caused by the incorrect checking of the index type within the loop. The function is checking the type of the index with `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods, but these methods do not exist in the given class. This is likely causing the function to throw errors and not perform as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to change the way we check the type of the index. Instead of calling methods that don't exist, we should use the `is_integer` and `is_numeric` functions that are imported from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` module.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `is_numeric_dtype` function to check the type of the indexes and keys, which should resolve the issue and prevent any errors from occurring.
