The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the class `_AtIndexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is used for converting keys to be the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to perform indexing operations, and the error message indicates that there is an issue with the indexing based on non-integer index.

The bug is caused by the function improperly handling the non-integer index. The condition `if ax.is_integer():` checks if the index is integer, and if not, it raises a ValueError. The issue arises when the non-integer index is encountered, but the condition should check if the index holds integer instead of whether it is an integer. Additionally, the function doesn't properly handle the case when integer is required for indexing non-integer index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the index holds integer and handle the case when integer is required for indexing non-integer index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
This fixed code will properly check for integer and non-integer index types and handle the indexing operations accordingly, passing the failing test.
