After analyzing the provided input/output variable information, it seems that the issue lies within the _convert_key function of the _AtIndexer class. The function is supposed to check if the index and the keys have the same type, but it currently checks if the index is an integer, which is not the correct condition.

The issue likely stems from the check `if ax.is_integer():` and the subsequent checks. Instead of checking if the index is an integer, the function should be verifying that the type of the key matches the type of the index.

To fix this issue, the buggy function should be modified to compare the types of the key and the index, and raise a ValueError if they are not the same type. We can use the `is_list_like` and `is_numeric_dtype` functions from the imported module to perform this comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_list_like(ax) and is_list_like(i):
                if not type(ax) == type(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Keys must be of the same type as the index"
                    )
            elif is_numeric_dtype(ax) and is_numeric_dtype(i):
                if not type(ax) == type(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Keys must be of the same type as the index"
                    )
            else:
                if not type(ax) == type(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Keys must be of the same type as the index"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected function checks if the type of the key matches the type of the index, and raises a ValueError if they are not the same type. This function should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided in the cases.
