Analysis:
1. The function is supposed to check if the keys match the type of the index. If is_setter is True, it should return a list of the keys. Otherwise, it should iterate through self.obj.axes and check if the type of the key matches the type of the index. If the types don't match, it should raise a ValueError.

2. The potential error location is within the loop that iterates through self.obj.axes and checks the type of the key.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods, as they are not defined for the `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex` classes. This leads to the incorrect validation of the type of the key against the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use the `is_numeric_dtype()` method to check if the index type is numeric, and then validate the key against it.
   b. Handle the numeric and non-numeric index types separately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError("Non-list-like indexing on a list-like index can only have list-like indexers")
        elif is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError("Numeric-based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers")
        else:
             raise ValueError("Index type not supported for indexing")

    return key
```
This corrected function uses the `is_numeric_dtype()` method to check the type of the index and validates the key against it. It handles different index types separately and raises a ValueError if the types don't match. This should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
