The problematic function `_convert_key` is intended to convert the key to the same type as the index. The issue seems to be with the way it handles integer and non-integer keys. The failing test shows that when indexing using non-integer key values, the function raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug in the `_convert_key` function, we need to modify the logic for handling non-integer keys. The error message suggests that non-integer indexes can only have non-integer indexers.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check for the type of the index and handle non-integer keys accordingly. If the index is non-integer, the function should allow non-integer keys, and if the index is integer, it should only allow integer keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i) and not is_sequence(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a {ax.dtype} index "
                    f"can only have {ax.dtype} indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_sequence(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a {ax.dtype} "
                    f"index can only have non-integer "
                    f"indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes handling for different types of indexes and keys, ensuring that each type matches appropriately. This should address the ValueError issue encountered in the failing tests.
