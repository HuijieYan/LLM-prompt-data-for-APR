The bug in the function `_convert_key` is that it's trying to access the method `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` directly on the `ax` which is a `Float64Index` object, and these methods are not available for `Float64Index` objects. Instead, the correct approach should be to use the functions `is_integer` and `is_numeric_dtype` available from the import statement provided.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function uses `is_numeric_dtype` to check if the index type is numeric, and uses `is_integer` to check if the indexer value is an integer. This change will fix the issues identified in the failing test cases and will satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
