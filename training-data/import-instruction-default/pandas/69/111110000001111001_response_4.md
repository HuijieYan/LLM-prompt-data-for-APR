The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where `if ax.is_integer()` is used. This is causing issues because `ax` is not guaranteed to be a scalar since `self.obj.axes` is a list (from which we get elements one by one using `zip`), and we can't call `is_integer()` on a list.

The bug is caused by incorrect validation of the index type, as the function fails to handle cases where the index axis is  numeric. The function does not handle different index types properly, leading to the validation issues.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the index type validation for the elements in the `key` tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            # Check if the value is numeric
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            # For non-numeric types, check for integers
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```
With this corrected function, it should now properly handle different index types and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
