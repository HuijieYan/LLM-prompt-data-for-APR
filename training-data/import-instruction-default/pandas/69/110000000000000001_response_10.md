1. The buggy function is supposed to convert keys to the same type as the index. However, there are several issues with the code:

- The function is missing the self parameter, indicating that it is a method of a class.
- There are references to ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer(), which seem to be referring to non-existent methods of the Index object.
- The function uses is_integer() and holds_integer() as if they were functions, but they are imported as is_integer and is_sequence functions.

2. The potential error locations are the references to ax.is_integer() and ax.holds_integer(), and the use of is_integer() and holds_integer() as functions.

3. The buggy function is attempting to check if the index is an integer index or a non-integer index, and then validate the key based on the index type.

4. The issue can be fixed by using the imported functions is_integer and is_sequence correctly, and also by properly accessing the index type using the self parameter and the object's axes.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code uses self.axes to access the object's axes and properly checks the index type using the is_numeric_dtype function and is_list_like function. It also uses the imported functions is_integer and is_list_like correctly for validation.
