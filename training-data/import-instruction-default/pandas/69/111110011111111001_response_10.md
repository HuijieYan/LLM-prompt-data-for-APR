The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method when checking if the key is an integer. The bug is caused by the method not recognizing floating-point numbers as integers, which leads to the method raising a `ValueError` when it shouldn't.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checking for integer values to include floating-point numbers.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the condition to check if the value is an integer or a float. We can use the `isinstance` function to check for both integer and float types in the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if (is_integer(i) or is_float(i)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, the `is_float` function will check if the variable `i` has a float type, which will prevent the function from raising a `ValueError` when dealing with floating-point keys.

This corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and behave as expected.
