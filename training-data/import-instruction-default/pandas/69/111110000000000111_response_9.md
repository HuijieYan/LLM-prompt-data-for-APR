Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy class _AtIndexer is related to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else statements where it checks for the type of the index and the key.
3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking for types using is_integer() instead of is_numeric_dtype(). This causes issues with Float64Index and Series lookups as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to replace the is_integer() checks with is_numeric_dtype() checks to ensure that the index and the key are of the same type.
5. The corrected code has been provided above, which resolves the issue posted in the GitHub discussion by using the correct type checking functions.
