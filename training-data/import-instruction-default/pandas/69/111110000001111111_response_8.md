The potential error in the function is the condition `if ax.is_integer():`. Since `ax` is of type `Float64Index`, the method `is_integer()` could be causing the issue. The condition is not handling the case when the index is of type `Float64Index`, which is causing the function to fail in certain cases.

The bug's cause is related to the class hierarchy and the incorrect handling of the index type within the `_convert_key` function. The expected input/output variable information, along with the GitHub issue, suggests that the bug is specifically related to handling `Float64Index` cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to handle `Float64Index` cases. We can check if the index is of type `Float64Index` and then verify if the key is of the appropriate type based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle both integer and float index types, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report related to `Float64Index` cases.
