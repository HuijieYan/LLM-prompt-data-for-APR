1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is used in the `_AtIndexer` class to convert keys based on the index type. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing various lookups on a Series with a Float64Index, and it is failing with a `ValueError` related to converting keys. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that checks the type of the index and the type of the key. This is where the ValueError is being raised, causing the failing test.

3. The bug in the `_convert_key` function is causing a ValueError to be raised when checking the index type and the key type. The failing test is testing various lookups on a Series with a Float64Index, and it is failing due to the ValueError being raised. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case, confirming that the bug is related to the `_convert_key` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include handling the conversion of keys for Float64Index more carefully, ensuring that the type of the key aligns with the index type. Additionally, the checks for integer and non-integer indexes need to be handled correctly based on the index type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function to fix the bug:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        if not all(isinstance(k, index_type) for k in key):
            raise ValueError(f"Keys must be of type {index_type.__name__}")
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, index_type):
            raise ValueError(f"Key must be of type {index_type.__name__}")

    return key
```

This corrected code includes checks to ensure that the keys align with the index type and handles both list-like and scalar keys appropriately. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
