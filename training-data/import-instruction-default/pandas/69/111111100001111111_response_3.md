Potential error location:
The issue is likely occurring in the loop where the function is checking whether the index is integer type or not. The function is incorrectly checking if the index is integer by calling `ax.is_integer()` instead of `is_integer(ax)`. This results in the condition always evaluating to False as the function `is_integer` is used to check if a value is an integer.

Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function `_convert_key` is checking whether the index is an integer using the method `ax.is_integer()`, which is incorrect.
(b) The buggy class `IndexingMixin` may also be related to the issue, as it contains the method `_convert_key`.
(c) The related functions may include any methods that interact with the index and are used within the context of the `_convert_key` function.
(d) The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values point to a misinterpretation of the data type of the index and the key value, leading to incorrect validation and subsequent code execution.
(e) The GitHub issue indicates that the bug impacts Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
The approach to fixing the bug involves modifying the condition that checks whether the index is an integer. The correct approach is to use the method `is_integer` to check if the index value is an integer.

Updated code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(ax):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function addresses the issue by using the correct method `is_integer` to check if the index value is an integer, and then comparing it with the key value to perform the necessary validation. This fix aligns with the expected input/output variable values and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub.
