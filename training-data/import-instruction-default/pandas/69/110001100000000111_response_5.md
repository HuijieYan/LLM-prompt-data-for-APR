The bug in the _convert_key function is related to the handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The function checks if the index is integer or not, and then compares the key against the index type. However, the issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that the bug is affecting series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional checks for integer and non-integer index types. The function appears to handle these cases incorrectly.

The bug's cause is related to the misinterpretation of index types and incorrect comparisons with the key.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for checking the index types and comparing them with the key. The corrected code should accurately handle integer and non-integer index types.

Here is the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_list_like(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the comparison between index types and keys more accurately. It checks for numeric index types, such as floats and integers, and ensures that the keys being used are of the same type for the corresponding index. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and fix the bug in the _convert_key function.
