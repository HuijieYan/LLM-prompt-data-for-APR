1. The buggy function `_convert_key` checks if the key is of the same type as the index, but there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the function.

2. Potential error location: The error might occur in the if-else condition inside the loop, where it checks if the index is integer or not.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not effectively checking whether the key is of the same type as the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use the pandas library functions to check the type of the index and key.
   b. Handle the logic for checking the type of the index and key more accurately.
   c. Validate the input key and index types to ensure compatibility.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers")
        elif is_list_like(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers")
        else:
            if type(ax) != type(i):
                raise ValueError("Index and indexers must be of the same type")

    return key
```
The corrected code uses the provided imports to check for the type of the index and key, and appropriately raises an error if they are not of the same type. It also handles the case where both the index and key are list-like. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
