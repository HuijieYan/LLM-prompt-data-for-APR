Potential error location: The potential error location is in the if statements where it checks if ax.is_integer() and if ax.holds_integer(). These conditions are checking for the type of the index, but the functions used (is_integer and holds_integer) are not the correct functions to use for this purpose.

Bug cause: The bug is caused by using incorrect functions to check for the type of the index. The functions is_integer() and holds_integer() are not valid functions for this purpose and are causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct functions to check for the type of the index.
2. Validate the key input to ensure that it is compatible with the index type.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
