The bug in the function `_convert_key` is in the logic that checks whether the index is an integer or non-integer index. The bug is caused by comparing the index type with the type of the key, which results in incorrect comparisons and error raises.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to properly check the type of the index and compare it with the type of key. Additionally, the logic for handling non-integer indexes needs to be updated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            index_type = ax.inferred_type
            value_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(i)
            if index_type != value_type:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Index type and key type do not match"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issues by properly checking the types of the index and the key, and ensuring they match for both numeric and non-numeric indexes. The corrected function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
