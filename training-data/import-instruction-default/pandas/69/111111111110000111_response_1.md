The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for raising a ValueError when attempting to index a non-integer index with an integer. The error message specifically mentions "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", indicating that the issue lies within this function.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling an index that is non-integer when an integer is used as the key.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to check for the data type of the index and ensure that the key matches. If the index is non-integer, the key should also be non-integer, otherwise, a ValueError should be raised.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i):
            if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass. The fix ensures that the key matches the data type of the index, preventing any mismatch and raising a ValueError if necessary. This solution also aligns with the issue posted on GitHub.
