The issue with the buggy function is that the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods are not being properly called on the index axes. Additionally, the comparison between the index and the key element types is not being done correctly, leading to the ValueError being raised even when the key matches the index type.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods properly and compare the types of the index and the key elements. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the key is a float and the index is an integer index. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_integer(ax):
            if is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle the comparison between the index and key types as expected in all cases.
