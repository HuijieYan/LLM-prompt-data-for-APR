The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is responsible for converting the key based on the type of the index and is utilized by the at-based indexing operation in pandas.

The failing test creates a series with an index of type `float64` and then tries to perform at-based indexing operations. The error message indicates that when attempting to perform the at-based indexing operation using an integer index (4), it resulted in a `ValueError` stating "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This is indicative of the problem with `_convert_key` function, where it fails to correctly handle conversion based on the type of the index.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to determine the type of index being used and ensure that it accepts only the corresponding key types. Additionally, it should accommodate both float and integer index types for at-based indexing operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function that resolves the bug:

```python
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_scalar(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have scalar indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have float indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected version checks the type of the index and ensures that it only accepts the corresponding key types, handling both float and integer index types for the at-based indexing operations. This would address the failing test case, and the error message encountered would be resolved.
