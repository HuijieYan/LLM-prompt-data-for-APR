The bug in the function `_convert_key` is causing the ValueError to be raised when the index is not of an integer type, even when the key is an integer.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect usage of the `is_integer()` function and the `holds_integer()` function. Instead of using these functions to check the type, we should be using `is_numeric_dtype()` to check if the index is of a numeric type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly identify the type of the index and key and raise the ValueError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly check the type of the index and the key and raise a ValueError if they are not compatible. This should resolve the bug and the failing test case.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
