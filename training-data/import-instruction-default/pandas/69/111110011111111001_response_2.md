The issue is with the `_convert_key` function, which is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The error message indicates that there is a problem with conversion of the key. The key is a tuple containing integer or float values, and the method should return a list of converted keys if is_setter is True. For non-setter operation, it iterates through the axes and checks if the axis is an integer. If it is, it checks if the key is also an integer and vice versa for non-integer axes.

The problem is that the function is not handling the input correctly and is not correctly identifying the types for the given keys, which leads to the `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the issue, the function should be modified to handle different types of keys based on the axis type and handle the conversion appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# Import statements
from pandas.core.indexing import IndexingMixin
from pandas.core.indexing._scalar import _ScalarAccessIndexer
from pandas._libs.indexing import convert_to_index_sliceable

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # Corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        axes = self.obj.axes
        converted_key = []

        for ax, i in zip(axes, key):
            if is_list_like(i) and not is_scalar(i):
                i = convert_to_index_sliceable(i)

            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            else:
                converted_key.append(i)

        return tuple(converted_key)
```

This corrected function handles the key conversion based on the axis type, checks if the key is list-like or scalar, and raises appropriate errors based on the type of index and key.
