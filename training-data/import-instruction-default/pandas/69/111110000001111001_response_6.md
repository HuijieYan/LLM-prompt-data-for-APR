1. The buggy function is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. It attempts to achieve this by checking if the index is an integer or non-integer and then validating the key accordingly. However, the bug lies in the way it is checking if the index is an integer. It is using the `is_integer()` method on the index axis to check if the axis consists of integers, but the correct method to use is `is_numeric_dtype` from the imported functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if ax.is_integer():`. This is not the correct way to check if the axis is numeric, as it should use the `is_numeric_dtype` method instead.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking if the index axis is an integer rather than if it is numeric, leading to incorrect validation of the key. This results in a discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values, where the function incorrectly raises a ValueError in some cases when it should not.

4. To fix the bug, the function should utilize the correct method, `is_numeric_dtype`, to check if the index axis is numeric, and then validate the key based on that information.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):



    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected function should now handle the validation of keys based on the correct type of the index axis and return the expected output for each given case.
