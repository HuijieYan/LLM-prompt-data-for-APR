The potential error in the buggy function is in the "for" loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and the key simultaneously. This is where the comparison between the type of the index and the type of the key takes place. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic, where it might not be correctly determining the type of the index and the key.

To fix the bug, we can use the provided import statements at the beginning to check the type of the index and the key using the appropriate functions. We can then compare the types of the index and the key to ensure they are compatible.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
