1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is used for indexing operations in pandas. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of date and time-like values when using various indexing methods. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `_convert_key` function when dealing with non-integer indexes.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the `for` loop where it checks whether `ax` (the index) is integer or not. This check is likely causing the issue with non-integer indexes.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` is used for type conversion and validation of keys for indexing operations.
   (b). The `_AtIndexer` class is affected because it uses the buggy `_convert_key` function for key conversion/validation.
   (c). The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is triggered when trying to access non-integer indexes, resulting in a ValueError.
   (d). The GitHub issue indicates that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case, suggesting that it's related to the handling of non-integer indexes.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Modify the type conversion/validation logic in the `_convert_key` function to appropriately handle non-integer indexes.
   - Ensure that the `_convert_key` function can handle different types of indexes and keys without raising errors.

5. Corrected Code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # The corrected _convert_key function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_list_like(ax):
                for val in i:
                    if not is_scalar(val):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on a non-scalar index can only have scalar indexers"
                        )
            else:
                if is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a scalar index can only have scalar indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected `_convert_key` function now checks for scalar and non-scalar indexes and keys, ensuring that it can handle different types of indexes without raising errors. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and also address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
