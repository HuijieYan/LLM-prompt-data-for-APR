The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle non-integer values correctly when the index is not of an integer type. The function should be modified to check if the index is of integer type and then verify if the key is also of an integer type.

Here's the modified function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if is_integer(i):
                if not is_integer(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-numeric index "
                    "can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function checks if the index is of a numeric type, and then verifies the type of the key based on the type of the index. If the index is of an integer type, it checks if the key is also an integer, and if the index is not an integer type, it checks if the key is not an integer. If the index is not of a numeric type, it ensures that the key is not of a numeric type as well.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
