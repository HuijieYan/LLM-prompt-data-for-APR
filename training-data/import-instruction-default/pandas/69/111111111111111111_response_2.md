Based on the analysis, the issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The issue is caused by the condition checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

The condition check for non-integer indexes is incorrectly raising a ValueError when the index is not holding an integer. This is causing the failing test cases when the index is non-integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this fix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
