The buggy function `_convert_key` is used for converting the index key to the same type as the index. This is causing issues with the `get_value` method for the `Float64Index` because it is not properly handling non-integer indexers.

The failing test is testing various lookups and asserts that the result of the lookup matches the expected value. The error message indicates that the problem arises within the `_convert_key` function when it encounters a non-integer indexer for a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides further context on the problem, stating that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be altered to properly handle non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes. This can be achieved by allowing non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype) and not is_float(i):
                i = ax._convert_scalar(i)
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fix ensures that non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes are properly handled without raising a ValueError. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
