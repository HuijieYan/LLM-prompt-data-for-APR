Based on the failing test and error message, it looks like the issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is not handling cases where key and index have different types correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking if the key matches the index type, leading to a ValueError in some scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the different cases where key and index have different types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i):
            i = ax._convert_scalar(i, allow_float=True)
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_numeric():
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_list_like(i):
                i = [i]
            i = ax._convert_scalar(i[0], allow_setop=ax.holds_integer(), allow_float=True)
            if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_numeric():
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the different cases where key and index have different types, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.

This fixed version of the function should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
