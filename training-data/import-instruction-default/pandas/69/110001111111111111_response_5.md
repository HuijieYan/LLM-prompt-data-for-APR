The cause of the bug is that the function `_convert_key` is not handling the conversion of keys properly, leading to errors in the index lookups.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is converted to the appropriate type based on the index type. We also need to handle the case where the key is a float and the index is an integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i) and not ax.is_numeric():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index "
                "can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle the input cases properly and ensure that the index lookups work as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing tests.

The GitHub issue title for this bug would be:
"FIX: DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value not handling index keys properly"

The detailed description for the GitHub issue would be:
"The `_convert_key` function was not correctly handling the conversion of index keys, leading to errors in index lookups. The issue has been fixed by updating the function to properly handle the key conversion based on the index type."
