The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it checks the type of the index and the key. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the is_integer() and holds_integer() functions, which are used to check if the index is an integer type or holds integer values. The bug occurs because these functions are incorrectly used to check the type of the key, causing the function to raise the ValueError incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should use the is_integer and is_numeric_dtype functions to check the type of the key and index. We should also remove the check for holds_integer as it is not needed.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code uses the is_numeric_dtype function to check the type of the index and the key. It removes the unnecessary check for holds_integer and ensures that the key and index have the same type before returning the key.
