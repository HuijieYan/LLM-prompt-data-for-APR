The problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the keys in the indexer. It compares the type of the keys with the type of the index and raises a `ValueError` if they don't match.

The bug lies in the comparison logic where it checks if `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)` and raises a `ValueError` if the conditions don't match. The bug is causing the test to fail with a `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic and conditions to correctly handle the comparison and avoid raising `ValueError` incorrectly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_scalar(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_sequence(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass now.
