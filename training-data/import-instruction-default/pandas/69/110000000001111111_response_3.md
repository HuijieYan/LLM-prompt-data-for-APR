The issue with the buggy function is that it expects the index and key to have the same type, but it does not handle cases where the key is a float in a Series with a datetime index. 

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates through the axes of the object. The function checks if the axis is an integer index and then checks if the key is an integer. However, this logic does not handle cases where the key might be a float.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle cases where the key is a different type than the index, leading to a ValueError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the key is a different type than the index. We can do this by checking if the key is a float and then verifying if the axis holds floats.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle cases where the key and index have different types, and it should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
