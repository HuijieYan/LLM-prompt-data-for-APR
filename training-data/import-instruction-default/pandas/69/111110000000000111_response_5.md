In the original code, the function attempted to convert the key into a list even when it was already a list, leading to unnecessary redundancy. Additionally, there was a check for integer types, but it should have been checking for numeric types. The GitHub issue highlighted problems with Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which suggests that the original function was not handling numeric types correctly. 

To fix the bug, I replaced the unnecessary conversion of the key into a list and changed the checks from integer to numeric types. This corrected code should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
