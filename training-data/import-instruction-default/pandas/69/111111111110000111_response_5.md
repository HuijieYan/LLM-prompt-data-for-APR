### Analyzing the buggy function and related components

The buggy function `_convert_key` is used in the class `_AtIndexer` from the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is responsible for converting the keys used for indexing and ensuring they are the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is failing with a `ValueError` related to non-integer indexing.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" states that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. This aligns with the failing test for the `_convert_key` function, which is associated with the `Float64Index`.

### Identifying the potential error location

The error occurs when checking whether the index is based on integers or non-integers. It seems that the code does not handle the case of a Float64Index correctly.

### Bug's Cause

The failing test is using a Float64Index, and the `_convert_key` function is throwing a ValueError due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug

1. Check the type of the index and handle Float64Index separately to ensure proper conversion of keys.
2. Update the logic to handle non-integer indexes correctly.

### Corrected code for the problematic function

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

### Summary

The failure in the `_convert_key` function for non-integer indexing has been identified. The corrected code now properly handles both integer and non-integer cases and should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
