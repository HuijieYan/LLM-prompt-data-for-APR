The potential error in the problematic function is with the `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` checks. These checks are not correct and are causing the function to fail for certain input cases. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post also confirms that the Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the indexing keys based on the type of index. The function is failing to correctly identify the type of index and determine if the keys are of the same type.

To fix the bug, we need to update the checks for the type of index and handle the keys accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function updates the checks for the type of index by using `isinstance` checks for `pd.Float64Index` and `pd.TimedeltaIndex`. It then raises the appropriate error messages based on the type of index and the type of key provided.

This should fix the bug and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
