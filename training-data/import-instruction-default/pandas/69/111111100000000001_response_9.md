The potential error in the problematic function is within the loop that iterates through the axes and checks if the index is an integer. The error is that it's using the method "is_integer()" and "holds_integer()" which are not proper methods for the given context.

To fix the bug, we need to use the numpy array method "is_integer" to check if the index is an integer, and "dtype.kind" to check the kind of data type in the array.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer) and not ax.dtype.kind == 'i':
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In this corrected function, we have used the `is_numeric_dtype` function to check if the index is a numeric data type, and the `np.issubdtype` method to check if the type of the index is an integer. We have also used `dtype.kind` to check the kind of data type in the array. This ensures that the function will properly handle cases where the index is either integer or non-integer type.
