The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for handling keys that are used for indexing in the pandas library. It checks if the keys are the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if the types don't match according to certain conditions.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` checks various index lookups using datetime64 and timedelta64 values. The error message indicates that there's an issue with non-integer indexers when using the `at` method.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides a brief description of the issue, stating that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the block of code that checks for non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer. This is likely where the ValueError is being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks for integer and non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` function. It seems like the current logic is not correctly handling non-integer indexers when the index is non-integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_sequence(i) and is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_scalar(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                "can only have scalar indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes modified checks for non-integer indexers and numeric indexers. It ensures that the keys are the same type as the index and handles non-integer indexers appropriately. This updated logic should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
