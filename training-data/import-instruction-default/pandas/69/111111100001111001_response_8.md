The issue with the `_convert_key` function lies in the way it checks for the appropriate index type when the key is being converted. It's not properly checking the type of the index and the type of the key elements. Also, there's no need to convert the key to a list when `is_setter` is True.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the key is being set (i.e., `is_setter` is True). If it is, we can return the key as is, without any conversion. If it's not a setter, then we need to loop through the axes of the index and check the type of each key element against the type of the axis. We also need to handle cases where the index type is not an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function that should address the bug and satisfy all the test cases:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return key

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected function handles the cases where the index type is numeric and the type of the key elements is different. It also handles the cases where the index type is non-numeric but the key element is numeric. This should now correctly convert the key based on the type of the index.
