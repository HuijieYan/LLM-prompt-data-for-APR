The buggy function `_convert_key` in `pandas/core/indexing.py` is used to convert a given key for indexing. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is testing various indexing operations involving datetime and timedelta values. The failing test throws a `ValueError` when calling `ser.at[4]`, indicating an issue with `ser.at` when indexing non-integer indices with an integer indexer.

From the error message and the source code, it's evident that the problematic portion of the function is the condition checking whether index holds integers. When the indexer `i` is an integer, but the axis `ax` does not hold integers, it raises a `ValueError`. This check is causing the failing test when `ser.at[4]` is called.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check whether the index is numeric and the indexer is numeric but not an integer. This modification will prevent the `ValueError` from being raised when using `.at` with non-integer indices.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_integer(i) and is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass without raising a `ValueError`.
