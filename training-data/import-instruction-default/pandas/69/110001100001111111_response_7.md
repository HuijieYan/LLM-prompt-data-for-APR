The issue seems to be with the comparison of index types and the type of the elements in the key. The function is not correctly verifying if the index is numeric or not and is not handling the case when the key is of a different type than the index. This is causing the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly check the type of the index and the elements in the key before performing the comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
