1. The buggy function in question is `_convert_key` which is defined within the `_AtIndexer` class. The failing test is related to the `Float64Index` case and it seems to be related to a mismatch between integer and non-integer indexers.
The GitHub issue title indicates that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` which suggests that the bug may lie in the implementation of the `get_value` method for these index types.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function seems to be in the for loop where it checks for integer and non-integer indexers.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The `_convert_key` function is used to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but it seems to be having issues with handling integer and non-integer indexers.
   (b). The `_AtIndexer` class contains the `_convert_key` function and it seems to be responsible for handling the indexing operations.
   (c). The failing test is related to using `ser.at[4]` which is causing a `ValueError` related to non-integer indexers for an index that should only have non-integer indexers.
   (d). The GitHub issue details that the bug affects Series lookups for the `Float64Index` case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review the implementation of the `_convert_key` function to ensure that it properly handles integer and non-integer indexers.
   (b). Check the implementation of the `get_value` method for `DTI` and `Float64Index` to see if there are any issues related to integer and non-integer indexers.

5. Here is the corrected version of the _convert_key function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i):
                if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
                if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with handling integer and non-integer indexers. It should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
