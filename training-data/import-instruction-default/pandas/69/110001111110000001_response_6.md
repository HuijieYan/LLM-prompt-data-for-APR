The problem occurs in the `_convert_key` function within the pandas.core.indexing.py file. This function is responsible for converting keys for indexing, and it currently raises a ValueError in the case of an integer key being used for non-integer indexes.

The failing test related to the `_convert_key` function is the `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py. The error message indicates that an At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers, resulting in a ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the non-integer indexers.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the index is numeric and handle the integer and non-integer cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if is_integer(i):
                if not ax.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

By incorporating these changes, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle the cases where the index is non-integer, and the failing test should pass without any errors.
