The potential error location in the function `_convert_key` is in the section where it checks if the index is an integer. There are two errors in the condition:

1. In the if condition `if ax.is_integer():`, the correct method should be `is_numeric_dtype(ax)`, as the `is_integer()` method does not exist for the `ax` object.
2. In the elif condition `else:`, the correct method should be `if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_integer(i):`, as the `ax.holds_integer()` method does not exist and should be replaced with `is_numeric_dtype(ax)`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace these incorrect method calls with the correct ones.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
In this corrected code, I've replaced the incorrect method calls with the correct ones: `is_numeric_dtype(ax)` and `is_integer(i)`. This will fix the bug of the function and prevent the potential ValueError from being raised incorrectly.
