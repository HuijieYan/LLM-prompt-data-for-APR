The `pandas` function `_convert_key` is used for converting a key before indexing, and in the failing test, it is throwing a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

Looking at the failing test and the error message, it seems that when calling `ser.at[4]` in the failing test, the `_convert_key` function is being invoked with a key of `(4,)`, and it's raising the `ValueError`. So the issue seems to be with this specific case where `ser.at[4]` is being called. 

The problem appears to be that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where `is_setter` is False and the key is an integer. This is causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

To fix this issue, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle the case where `is_setter` is False and the key is an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (int, float)):
        return [key]
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This update checks if the key is either an `int` or `float`, and if so, it wraps it into a list. This will handle the case where a single integer value is passed as the key in `ser.at[4]`, ensuring that the function will not raise a `ValueError`.
