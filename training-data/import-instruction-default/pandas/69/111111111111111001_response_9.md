### Bug Cause:
The `_convert_key` function is supposed to convert the keys such that they are the same type as the index. It allows arbitrary setting if `is_setter` is True. If not, it checks each axis in the object's axes and the corresponding value in the key to ensure that there is no discrepancy between the types of the indices and keys.

The bug arises from the fact that the case when `ax` is not an integer is not being handled correctly. This leads to mismatches between the type of the index and the key, resulting in the ValueError.

### Potential location of the bug:
The bug is in the `else` part of the `for` loop where it checks if `ax` holds an integer.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to handle the case where `ax` is not an integer and perform the necessary checks to ensure that there are no type discrepancies.

### Updated/Copied Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_float(i) and not is_integer(i) and not is_sequence(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the function will check whether `i` is not a float, not an integer, and not an iterable sequence, thus ensuring that the keys are the same type as the index.

This updated function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
