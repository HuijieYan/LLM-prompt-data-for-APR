The bug in the `_convert_key` function seems to be related to checking the type of the index and the type of the key elements. Based on the inputs and outputs observed, the function is expecting that the index is of type Float64Index, but it is not checking for this.

The potential error location is the block of code that checks if `ax` is integer and if `i` is integer. This block of code does not take into account the possibility of non-integer index types, such as Float64Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to check if the index is of a numeric type (integer or float) and if the key element is of the same numeric type. We can use the `is_numeric_dtype` function from pandas library to check if the index is of a numeric type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code should now satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
