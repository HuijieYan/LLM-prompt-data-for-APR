The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling non-integer indexers correctly when it encounters non-integer indexes. This leads to a ValueError being raised incorrectly when accessing index values. The function is not checking properly if the indexer 'i' is a float or an integer for different types of indexes.

To address this issue, we need to check the types of the indexer and the index itself before raising a ValueError. If the index is a float, we need to check that the indexer is also a float, and if the index is an integer, we need to check that the indexer is an integer.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(ax[0]):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(ax[0]) and not ax.holds_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function accounts for both float and integer indexers, and this should resolve the issues found in the failing tests.
