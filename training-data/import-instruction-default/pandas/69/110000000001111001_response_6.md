The problematic function is supposed to convert the input 'key' to the same type as 'self.obj', depending on the data type of 'self.obj'. The code checks whether the index of 'self.obj' is an integer index, and then checks if the type of the elements in 'key' is appropriate based on the data type of 'self.obj'.

The bug occurs in the logic of checking the index and elements in 'key'. The function uses incorrect methods to check if the index is an integer type and if the elements in 'key' are of the appropriate type based on 'self.obj'. The incorrect methods used are 'ax.is_integer()' and 'ax.holds_integer()'. These methods do not exist and need to be replaced with appropriate checks based on the data type of the index.

To fix the bug, we need to change the method used to check the data type of the index and the elements in 'key' based on the data type of 'self.obj'. Once the appropriate methods are used, the function should be able to correctly identify if the elements in 'key' are of the correct type. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index "
                    "can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In this corrected version, 'is_integer()' and 'holds_integer()' have been replaced with 'is_numeric_dtype()' for checking the data type of the index and the elements in 'key' based on the data type of 'self.obj'. Now the function should be able to correctly validate the type of 'key' based on the type of 'self.obj' for all the input cases provided.
