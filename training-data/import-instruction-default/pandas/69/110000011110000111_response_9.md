The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index. It checks whether the index is an integer and then ensures that the key is also an integer. However, there is an issue in the logic when dealing with non-integer indexes.

In the failing test, the test case is dealing with a `Float64Index` and the error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This suggests that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" further confirms that there is a bug in how the `Float64Index` is handled by the `get_value` method, which is related to the `_convert_key` function.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer indexes, specifically the `Float64Index` case. It should allow non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes and raise an error only if the indexer is an integer for a non-integer index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers")
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers")
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly, resolving the bug. This fix will pass the failing test and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
