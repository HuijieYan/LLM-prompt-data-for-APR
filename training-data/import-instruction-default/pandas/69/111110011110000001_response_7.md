The buggy function is _convert_key. It takes a key and a boolean flag is_setter. When this flag is True, the function converts the key to a list. When it's False, the function iterates through the key and validates it based on the axes of the object.

The failing test is trying to access a value from a Series using at method with a non-integer key, which should raise a ValueError according to the error message.

The problem is occurring in the loop inside the _convert_key function where it's checking if the key is an integer when the axis is non-integer, but it mixes up the conditions and raises a ValueError for the opposite scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks inside the for loop of `_convert_key` function to raise the ValueError when the conditions are met. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
After the correction, the _convert_key function will correctly check for integer or non-integer keys based on the axis and raise a ValueError in the appropriate scenarios.
