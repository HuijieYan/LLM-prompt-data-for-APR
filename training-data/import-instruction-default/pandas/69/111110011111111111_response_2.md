The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is designed to convert the key value to the same type as the index, but it's not handling float and integer conversions correctly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

Based on the error message and the failing test, the bug is likely occurring in the `is_integer(i)` and `ax.holds_integer()` checks, causing the function to raise a `ValueError` when performing lookups on non-integer indices with integer keys.

The bug is causing the failing test to raise a `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`. This is due to the problematic logic in the `_convert_key` function, leading to incorrect handling of integer and float keys for non-integer indices.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle integer and float key conversions based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Index) and not is_list_like(i):
            i = [i]

        if not is_scalar(i) and not is_sequence(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing can only have a scalar or a sequence of indexers"
            )
        
        for ind in i:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(ind):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(ind) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )

    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function now correctly handles the type conversion of keys based on the index type, and it should resolve the issues reported in the failing test.

This updated function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
