The issue in the `_convert_key` function is that it is not correctly handling the case when the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float. It is raising a ValueError when it should not be. The issue is occurring because the function is not correctly checking for floats when the index is a Float64Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the case when the index is a Float64Index. This can be done by checking if the index is a Float64Index and if the key is a float, then simply return the key without raising an error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and is_float(i):
            continue
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now correctly handle the case when the index is a Float64Index and the key is a float, without raising a ValueError. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
