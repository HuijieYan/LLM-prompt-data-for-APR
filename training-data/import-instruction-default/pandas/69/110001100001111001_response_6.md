The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly checks for integer and non-integer types and it doesn't handle float values properly. The function currently checks if the index is an integer, and if so, it expects the key to be an integer as well, but it doesn't take into account that the key might be a float.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle float values properly by checking if the index is numeric instead of just checking if it is an integer or not. We should also remove the unnecessary checks for setting is_setter, as it doesn't seem relevant to the current problem.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have scalar indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_list_like(i) and not is_iterator(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have scalar indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle both float and integer keys properly and should satisfy all the provided test cases.
