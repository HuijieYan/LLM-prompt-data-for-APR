Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue, it seems that the function `_convert_key` is related to the issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The function appears to be used for checking keys against the index type, and it seems that the bug is causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it checks the type of the index and the key. Specifically, the if-else conditions where it checks if the index is an integer and if the key is also an integer.

The bug's cause, as per the function and the GitHub issue, seems to be related to how the function handles indexing on integer indexes and non-integer indexes. It appears that the function does not handle the Float64Index case correctly.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to handle the Float64Index case separately in the function. This may involve checking the type of the index and the key specifically for Float64Index, and setting the appropriate conditions for handling keys in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes handling the Float64Index case by checking if the index and the key are both numeric types using the `is_numeric_dtype` method. This ensures that the function properly handles the issue with Series lookups for the Float64Index case as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
