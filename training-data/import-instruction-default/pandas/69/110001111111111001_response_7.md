The issue in the `_convert_key` function is that it is checking if `ax` is an integer and then checking if `i` is an integer. If `ax` is non-integer, it should not check `is_integer(i)`, and instead, it should check if `i` is a float. Additionally, there is a potential issue with type checking, the function is not using the provided type checking functions like `is_float`, `is_integer` etc. 

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the type checking logic and correct the error message for non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_scalar(i) and not isinstance(i, (tuple, str, list)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have scalar, tuple, list or string indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_scalar(i) and not isinstance(i, (str, list)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have scalar, list or string "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `is_numeric_dtype` and `is_scalar` functions to check the type of `ax` and `i`. It also correctly checks for non-numeric indexers as per the failing test case. This version of the function should now pass the failing test.
