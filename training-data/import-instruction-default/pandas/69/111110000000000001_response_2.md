The potential error location in the problematic function is in the 'for' loop that iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the key is of the same type as the index. 

The bug's cause is that the loop is not correctly checking the type of the key against the type of the index.

To fix this bug, we can redefine the loop to use the 'is_list_like' function to check if the key is list-like, and then check the types of the elements in the key against the types of the corresponding axes.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, k in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_list_like(k):
                for i in k:
                    if ax.is_integer():
                        if not is_integer(i):
                            raise ValueError(
                                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                                "can only have integer indexers"
                            )
                    else:
                        if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                            raise ValueError(
                                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                                "index can only have non-integer "
                                "indexers"
                            )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer():
                    if not is_integer(k):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on an integer index "
                            "can only have integer indexers"
                        )
                else:
                    if is_integer(k) and not ax.holds_integer():
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                            "index can only have non-integer "

                        )
        return key
