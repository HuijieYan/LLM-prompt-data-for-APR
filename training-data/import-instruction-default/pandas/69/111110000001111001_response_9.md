The buggy function is intended to check whether the keys passed to it are of the same type as the index. However, when iterating through the axes of the object, it incorrectly checks if the axis is an integer using the `is_integer` method, which is not a valid method for the `Float64Index` type. As a result, the function always hits the else case and does not perform the necessary checks.

To fix this bug, the function should utilize the `is_numeric_dtype` method from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` import in order to check if the index is a numeric data type instead of using the `is_integer` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers" if is_numeric_dtype(ax) 
                    else "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code solves the bug by using the `is_numeric_dtype` method instead of `is_integer`, which will correctly check if the keys match the index's numeric data type. The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and fixes the bug in the original function.
