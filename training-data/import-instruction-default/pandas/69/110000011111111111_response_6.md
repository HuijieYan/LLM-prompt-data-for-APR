The issue with the buggy function `_convert_key` is that it incorrectly checks if the index is integer using `ax.is_integer()` and if the key is integer using `is_integer(i)`. However, it should actually be checking if the index is numeric using `is_numeric_dtype(ax)` and if the key is numeric using `is_numeric_dtype(i)`.

The failing test is related to the `Float64Index` case, and the error message indicates that there is a problem with the keys being non-integer while the index is non-integer. This aligns with the bug in the function, as it incorrectly checks for integer instead of numeric values.

The GitHub issue suggests that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly check if the index and key are numeric rather than just integer. We also need to handle the case when the index is non-integer and the key is integer or vice versa.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly checks if the index and key are numeric, and raises a ValueError if they are not of the same type. This fix addresses the issue and should make the failing test pass. It also aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.

With this fix, the GitHub issue related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` should also be resolved.
