The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function where it checks for the type of the index values. The check for `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` is causing the function to raise a `ValueError` in cases where the index type is not integer. This is evident from the failing test and error message, where the function raises a `ValueError` for non-integer index types.

The bug is caused by the incorrect type check in the `_convert_key` function, which is not handling non-integer index types appropriately. This is leading to the `ValueError` being raised for non-integer indexes.

To fix this bug, we can simply replace the type checks with the `is_integer` and `is_numeric_dtype` functions from the imported module `pandas.core.dtypes.common`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub link provided.
