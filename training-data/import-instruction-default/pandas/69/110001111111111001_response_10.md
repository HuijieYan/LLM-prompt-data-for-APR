The issue in the buggy function is that the function is converting the key to a list without considering the type of index. The error occurs in the loop where it checks if the index is an integer and then checks if the key is an integer. However, it does not consider the case when the index is not an integer. Additionally, `is_integer()` and `is_scalar()` are not the correct functions to use in this context.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the index type is numeric and compare it with the type of the key. We will also handle the case when the index is not an integer index and the key is an integer. We will fix this by checking the index type and adding a condition to handle non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_list_like(ax) and not is_scalar(ax):
            if not is_list_like(i) and is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a non-integer index {type(ax)} can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a non-numeric index {type(ax)} can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds a check to see if the index is non-integer or non-numeric, and then raises an appropriate ValueError if the key does not match the type of the index. This should fix the issues encountered in the failing tests.
