The issue is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class being overly restrictive when checking for integer indexers. The function is checking if the indexer is an integer, but it should be checking if the indexer is a float and not an integer.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to check for float indexers instead of integer indexers.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):


    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_float(i):  # check for float indexers
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have float indexers"  # updated error message
                    )
            else:
                if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_integer():  # check for non-integer indexers
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function now correctly handles integer and non-integer indexers, as well as float indexers. This code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
