The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is used to ensure that keys are the same type as the index.

The error in the function occurs in the `for` loop where it checks if the index is an integer or non-integer. The error is raised in the `else` block if the index is an integer and the axis does not hold an integer.

When looking at the failing test and the error message, it's clear that the issue is with how the function handles the keys when the index is non-integer, and the indexer is an integer.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer index and integer indexers. Instead of checking `ax.holds_integer()`, we can use the `interval_columns` attribute available within the pandas package to check if the index is numeric.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks if the axis is numeric using `is_numeric_dtype(ax)` and then verifies if the indexers are numeric or not. This approach should fix the issue and make the function work correctly with both integer and non-integer indexes.
