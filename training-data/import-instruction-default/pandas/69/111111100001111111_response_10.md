The potential error in the problematic function is the inconsistency in handling different types of index values within the for loop. This causes the function to raise ValueError in some cases where it shouldn't.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling different index types and scalars. The function should check if the index is an integer index or not and handle the key accordingly, but it is not doing so effectively. This leads to inconsistent behavior and incorrect ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle different index types and scalars. We can do this by checking the type of the index and the key and raising ValueErrors accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_list_like(ax) and not is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code will handle different index types and scalars properly, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and doesn't raise unnecessary ValueErrors. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
