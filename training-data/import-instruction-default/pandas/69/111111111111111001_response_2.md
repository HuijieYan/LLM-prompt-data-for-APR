Issues:
1. The function `is_integer` is being called as a standalone function instead of being a method of the `ax` object.
2. The type checking logic inside the loop is incorrect for scenarios where `ax` is non-integer type.
3. The method should correctly handle different types of indexes and keys.

Based on the analysis, the bug occurs because the type checking logic is incorrect inside the loop and the error is raised when the key is non-integer and the index is non-integer type.

To fix the bug, the type checking logic needs to be updated based on the index type and the `is_integer` method should be called appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if is_integer(i) or is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    if not is_integer(i) and not is_sequence(i):
                        raise ValueError(
                            f"At based indexing on an integer index of type {type(ax).__name__} can only have integer indexers"
                        )
                else:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax).__name__} can only have indexers of type {type(ax).__name__}"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_list_like(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"At based indexing on an index of type {type(ax).__name__} can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )

        return key
```

The corrected function includes the appropriate calls to `is_integer` and `is_numeric_dtype` to handle different index types and keys. The type checking logic has been updated to cover different scenarios and data types. This function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
