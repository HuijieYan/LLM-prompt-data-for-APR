The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when the index is of type timedelta64. It only checks for integer and non-integer indexes, but does not consider floats. Additionally, it doesn't handle the case when the key is of type float instead of int.

To fix the bug, we need to add checks for float indexes and keys. We can use the `is_float` function to check if the index is a float, and the `is_float` and `is_integer` functions to check if the key is a float or int. We also need to import these functions from the pandas library.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_numeric_dtype, is_scalar, is_sequence

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if is_float(i) and not is_integer(i) and not is_float(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not is_float(i) and is_float(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle both integer and float indexes, as well as integer and float keys, for both datetime and timedelta types.
