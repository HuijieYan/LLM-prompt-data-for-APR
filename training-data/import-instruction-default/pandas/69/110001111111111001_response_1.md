The problem in the buggy function comes from the loop that iterates over the axes of the object. The condition for checking if the axis is integer is incorrect, and the check for whether `i` is an integer also needs to be fixed. 

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to determine the correct way to check if an index is an integer and if the value `i` is an integer, and then update the conditions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function uses the `is_numeric_dtype` function from the `pandas` library to correctly check if the type is numeric, instead of using `is_integer` and `is_scalar` as in the original function. It ensures that the keys are the same type as the index, and handles both integer and non-integer index and key types. This fix should resolve the issues identified in the failing tests.
