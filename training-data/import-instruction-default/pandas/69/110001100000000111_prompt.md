Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.


# The source code of the buggy function
You can assume that the following imports are available in current environment and you don't need to import them again when generating fix patch.
```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_numeric_dtype, is_scalar, is_sequence
```

# The sourcecode provided below contains buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):

            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
