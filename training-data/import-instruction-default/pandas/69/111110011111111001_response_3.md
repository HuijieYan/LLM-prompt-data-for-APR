The issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The function checks if the key is the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if there is a mismatch. The problem arises when the key is being checked for being an integer or not and whether the corresponding axis is an integer axis or not. This logic is buggy and needs to be corrected.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking for integer values in the key and the axis.

To fix this issue, the logic for checking if the key is an integer or not needs to be modified. Instead of checking for integer keys and integer axes, we should instead check the dtype of the key and axis to see if they are compatible. If they are both numeric types (e.g., float or int), then the check should pass.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype) and is_numeric_dtype(i):
                continue
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an index with numeric dtype "
                    "can only have indexers with numeric dtype"
                )
        return key
```

With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected.
