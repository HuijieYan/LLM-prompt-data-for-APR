After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug lies in the `_convert_key` function. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This means that the function checks if the index is an integer index, and if so, it only allows integer indexers. If the index is not an integer index, it only allows non-integer indexers. However, in the failure cases, the function does not consider the case where an index can be floating-point and still hold integer values (e.g., `3.0, 4.0, 5.0`). This is causing the ValueError in the test cases where the index is float but the function does not allow integer indexers.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to handle the case of floating-point indexes that still hold integer values. This can be done by checking for float indexes that hold integer values and allowing integer indexers in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function, which should pass the failing tests:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                # Check if the index is a float index that holds integer values
                if is_float(i) and is_integer(i) and ax.astype(int).equals(ax):
                    continue  # Allow integer indexers for float indexes holding integer values
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By adding the additional condition to check if the index is a float index that holds integer values, the corrected function allows integer indexers in that case and should now pass the failing test cases.
