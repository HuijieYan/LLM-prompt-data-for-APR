The `pandas` function `_convert_key` has been flagged with the following ValueError: "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." based on the information provided.

1. Analyzing the function:
   - The function `_convert_key` is used for setting keys based on particular data types in a pandas dataframe. It involves checking if a key meets specific criteria based on the type of the axis (e.g., integer or non-integer index).

2. Potential error location:
   - The bug might be occurring in the conditional statements that compare integer and non-integer types of keys with the corresponding types of indices.

3. Explanation of the bug's cause:
   - The error message is coming from the code that is checking whether the keys being applied to the index are compatible with the type of the index. In the failing test, the error is raised because the key (`4`) is being checked against a non-integer index, and the function is not handling this case correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - The function should be updated to handle non-integer indices correctly and not raise an error when the index itself is non-integer type (and vice-versa for integer indices).
   - This should be done by adjusting the conditional checks and their logic to allow for proper handling of both integer and non-integer indices.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the non-integer condition to `if not is_integer(i)`, it ensures that the function does not raise an error when the index is non-integer type, as needed.
