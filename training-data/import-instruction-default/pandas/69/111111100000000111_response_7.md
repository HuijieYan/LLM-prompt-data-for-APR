1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for ensuring that keys are of the same type as the index when performing indexing. The function iterates through the object's axes and checks if the type of the key matches the type of the axis. If not, it raises a ValueError.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely in the loop where it iterates through the object's axes and checks the type of the key against the type of the axis.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect type checking in the loop, causing the function to incorrectly raise a ValueError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revising the type checking logic within the loop to correctly handle the type matching between the key and the axis.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            elif is_float(i) and not ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
            elif not is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_sequence(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Invalid indexer/indices type: {type(i).__name__}"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected function includes more specific type checking to ensure that the key's type matches the index's type appropriately. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
