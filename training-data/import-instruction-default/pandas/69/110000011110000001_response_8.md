The issue is with the `_convert_key` function that fails during the tests. The function checks the data type and throws errors inaccurately, which leads to a `ValueError` during the test.

Potential Bug:
The potential issue is that the `_convert_key` function incorrectly raises a `ValueError` when it encounters a non-integer index. This check is not necessary and is leading to the failure of the test.

The `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexing appropriately. This will involve removing unnecessary type checks that are currently leading to the `ValueError`.

Approach:
The approach to fix this would involve removing unnecessary type checks related to integer and non-integer indexes, and allowing arbitrary setting of keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    return key
```

This corrected function will address the issues raised in the failing test and error message, and it should now pass the failing test.
