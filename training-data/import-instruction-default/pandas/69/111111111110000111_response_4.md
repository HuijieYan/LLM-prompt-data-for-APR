The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for validating the keys to be the same type as the index. It checks if the keys are integers and if the index holds integers or not. The error occurs due to the inappropriate handling of the non-integer index in the Float64Index case. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised, as observed in the failing test and error message.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle non-integer indexes in the context of a Float64Index.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a specific condition to handle non-integer indexes in the case of Float64Index. This condition should allow for non-integer indexers when the index is a Float64Index. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, type(np.float64(0))):
            continue  # allow non-integer indexers for Float64Index
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds a condition to allow non-integer indexers for `Float64Index`, while still enforcing the requirement for integer indexers in other cases. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to handle non-integer indexes correctly.

By using the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
