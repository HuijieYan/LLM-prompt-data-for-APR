Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error likely occurs within the for loop in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the section where it checks if the index is an integer and then proceeds to check if the indexer is an integer. This is shown in the error message where it raises a ValueError for non-integer index with non-integer indexers.

Bug's cause:
The bug appears to be caused by the function not handling non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError being raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the for loop to correctly handle non-integer indexers based on the index type.
2. Add additional checks or conditions to handle non-integer indexers appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_float(i) and not ax.is_floating():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-float index "
                "can only have non-float indexers"
            )
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

The corrected version of the function should handle both non-float and non-integer indexers appropriately based on the type of the index. This updated logic should address the issue and ensure that the failing test passes, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
