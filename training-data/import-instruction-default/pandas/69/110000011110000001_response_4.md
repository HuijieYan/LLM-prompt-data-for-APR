The error is occurring when the at function is called with an integer argument. The _convert_key function of the indexing module raises a ValueError when at based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. This is likely due to a type mismatch between the indexer and the index in the at function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _convert_key function to handle integer and non-integer indexes appropriately. 

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_scalar(i) and not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, the at function should now be able to handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly and pass the failing test.
