1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer`. It is used to convert the keys for indexing in a pandas DataFrame or Series. The buggy function checks if the keys are of the same type as the index, and if not, it raises a ValueError. The issue in the function is potentially related to the handling of integer and non-integer indexes and keys.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison and validation of the keys and the index axes.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using:

   (a). The buggy function (`_convert_key`) is responsible for converting keys used for indexing in a pandas DataFrame or Series.

   (b). The buggy class (`_AtIndexer`) contains the `_convert_key` method and is related to indexing operations in pandas.

   (c). The related functions include those responsible for indexing and data access in pandas, as well as the validation of index and key types.

   (d). The GitHub issue information states that the bug affects the `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` for Series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: refining the logic for validating index and key types, ensuring that the correct comparison and error handling is performed for integer and non-integer indexes, and addressing the corner cases specific to `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        if is_iterator(key):
            return list(key)
        else:
            return [key]
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        elif not is_list_like(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code refines the logic for validating index and key types. It ensures that proper comparison and error handling is performed for numeric and non-numeric indexes, addressing the corner cases specific to `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.
