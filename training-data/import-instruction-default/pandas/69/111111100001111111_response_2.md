The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the index being an integer. The function is currently checking for whether the index is an integer, but it should be checking whether the index data type is numeric.

The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking for integer type when it should be checking for numeric data type. This causes the function to raise a ValueError in cases where it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to check for numeric data type instead of an integer type. This will allow the function to handle both integer and float values correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not ax.is_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function checks for numeric data type instead of integer type, and it should now handle both integer and float values correctly. This fix satisfies all the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
