1. The _convert_key function is part of the _AtIndexer class in the indexing.py file of the pandas library. It is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" points to an issue with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error in the _convert_key function lies in the conditional checks within the for loop that iterates over the axes and keys.

3. The cause of the bug is the conditional checks within the for loop that are not properly handling the cases for integer and non-integer indexes, leading to incorrect behavior when using Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding proper conditional checks to handle integer and non-integer index cases within the for loop
   - Ensuring that the conversion of keys to the same type as the index is done correctly

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # the fixed function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_numeric_dtype and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
