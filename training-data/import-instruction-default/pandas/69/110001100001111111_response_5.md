The issue is with the comparison of the index type and the key type. The function should be checking if the index and key are of the same type, rather than using the `is_integer()` function.

To fix this, we need to replace the `is_integer()` function with `is_integer` condition checks. Additionally, we need to change the condition to check if the key and index have the same type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float64 index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
                if not is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not is_integer(i) and not is_sequence(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function uses `isinstance()` to check the type of the index, and then makes appropriate comparisons with the key. This should fix the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
