The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the index is of type float or integer, and the input key for indexing is of a different type (e.g., int when the index is float or vice versa). The function should account for this and raise an error in such cases, but it currently does not.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key when indexing. If they are not the same type, we should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (ExtensionIndex, Index)) and not is_scalar(i) and not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
                raise ValueError(f"key must be of the same type as the index ({type(ax[0])}).")
        return key
```

With this fix, the function will correctly raise a ValueError if the key type does not match the index type. This should resolve the issues seen in the failing test cases.
