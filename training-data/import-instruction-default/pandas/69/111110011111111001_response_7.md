The bug in the provided function is that it checks whether the index axes are integer or not, and if not, it raises a ValueError. This check is not required and is causing the function to fail. We need to remove this unnecessary check.

In the failing tests, the input parameters and expected output are representative of the error cause. The failing tests reveal that the `ValueError` is being raised when the function is called with a valid index and key. The expected behavior should allow for both float and integer keys to be handled appropriately.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary index type checks should be removed from the function implementation. Here's the corrected version of the function with the unnecessary checks removed:

```python
from pandas.core.indexing import IndexingMixin

class _AtIndexer(IndexingMixin, _ScalarAccessIndexer):
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        return key
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and satisfy all the failing test cases. Now, the function will handle both float and integer indexes appropriately without raising unnecessary `ValueError` exceptions.
