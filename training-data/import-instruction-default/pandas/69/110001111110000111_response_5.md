The problematic function is `_convert_key` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. It is intended to require the keys to be the same type as the index and raise an error if they are not. However, it seems to be incorrectly handling non-integer indexes.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is failing with a `ValueError` related to non-integer indexing.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides a detailed description of the problem. It appears that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_convert_key` is the check for non-integer indexes. It seems to be incorrectly handling non-integer indexes and raising a `ValueError` when it shouldn't.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Re-evaluating the logic for handling non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function.
2. Ensuring that the function correctly handles the cases for non-integer indexes without raising unnecessary `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should correctly handle non-integer indexes without raising unnecessary `ValueError` and pass the failing test. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
