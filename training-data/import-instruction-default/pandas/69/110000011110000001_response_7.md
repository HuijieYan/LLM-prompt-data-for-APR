Potential Error Location:
The potential error is caused in the 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer()' functions. It seems these functions are not working as expected in the '_convert_key' function. This is leading to the raising of the ValueError.

Bug's Cause: 
- The bug is being caused because the 'is_integer' function does not return the expected result. This is causing the ValueError to be raised.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- The 'is_integer' function needs to return the correct result according to the provided input key.
- Ensure that the function is properly validated for non-integer indexes to avoid raising the ValueError.


The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
