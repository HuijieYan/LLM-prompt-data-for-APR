After analyzing the given function and the failing test, as well as the expected and actual input/output variable information, it appears that the issue lies in the `_convert_key` function. The function checks if the input key matches the data type of the index, and raises a ValueError if they don't match. This is causing the failing test due to a mismatch in the input key and the data type of the index.

The issue can be resolved by modifying the `_convert_key` function to handle the cases where the input key does not match the data type of the index in a more flexible way.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to convert the input key to the same data type as the index, rather than raising an error if there is a mismatch. This will make the function more robust and allow it to handle different data types for the input key.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Convert the input key to the same data type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    converted_key = []
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_float(i):
                converted_key.append(float(i))
            else:
                converted_key.append(i)
        else:
            converted_key.append(i)
    return tuple(converted_key)
```

With this corrected code for the `_convert_key` function, it should now satisfy the failing test and produce the expected input/output variable values. This updated function will be more flexible in handling different data types for the input key, matching the behavior expected in the failing test.
