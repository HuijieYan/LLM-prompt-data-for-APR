The potential error seems to be occurring within the for loop, where the function is iterating through the axes of the object and checking if the index is an integer. It then compares with the type of the indexer. If the index is an integer, it should only accept integer indexers, and if the index is non-integer, it should only accept non-integer indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by using the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions, which are not standard methods for checking the type of an object. The correct approach would be to use the `is_integer` and `is_float` functions provided in the imports.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float, is_integer, is_iterator, is_list_like, is_numeric_dtype, is_scalar, is_sequence

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                        "can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-numeric "
                        "index can only have non-numeric "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
