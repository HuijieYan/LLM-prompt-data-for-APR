Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks if `ax` is an integer and whether `i` is also an integer.

Bug's Cause:
The bug's cause lies in the inconsistent handling of integer and non-integer indexers when using at-based indexing in the `_convert_key` function. This inconsistency affects the Series lookups for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the data type of `i` and compare it directly with the data type of the index, instead of using the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions.
2. Consider using a more direct approach to validate the compatibility of the keys with the index data type.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function directly checks for the data type compatibility between the index and the keys, using the `is_numeric_dtype` function. This ensures consistent handling of numeric and non-numeric indexers, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
