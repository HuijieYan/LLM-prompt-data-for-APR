Potential error location:
The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the loop that iterates through `self.obj.axes` and `key`. It's not handling cases where the types of the index and the key are different appropriately.

Bug cause:
The `_convert_key` function does not handle the cases where the types of the index and the key are different. This is causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index and key have the same type. If not, handle the conversion appropriately.
2. Use the `is_numeric_dtype` function to differentiate between integer and float types and handle the conversion based on this.

Corrected code for the `buggy function`:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):



    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                i = i if is_numeric_dtype(i) else float(i)
            else:
                i = i if not is_numeric_dtype(i) else int(i)
        return key
```
This corrected code should handle the different types of index and key appropriately and solve the issue with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
