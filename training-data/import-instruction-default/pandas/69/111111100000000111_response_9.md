1. The problematic function _convert_key is part of the _AtIndexer class in the indexing.py file of the pandas library. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic used to check the type of index and the type of key, especially when dealing with integer and non-integer indexes.

3. The bug's cause may be due to the incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes when checking the type of the key. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the case of Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for checking the type of indexes and keys to ensure it is correctly handling integer and non-integer cases.
   - Adding specific checks for Float64Index to address the issues with Series lookups.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                if not is_float(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                        "can only have float indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific check for Float64Index to ensure that it only accepts float indexers. This addresses the issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The other checks for integer and non-integer indexes have also been reviewed and updated to handle the cases correctly. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
