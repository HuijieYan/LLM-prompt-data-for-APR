The bug is caused by a type mismatch issue in the `_convert_key()` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is used to convert keys for indexing, and it checks the type of the index when handling the keys.

The error message indicates that a `ValueError` is being raised, specifically "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This error occurs when the indexer is not of the same type as the index it's trying to access.

The corresponding GitHub issue title suggests that the bug affects corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_convert_key()` function to handle the case when the indexer and the index don't match in type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key()` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the indexer is of the same type as the index
        if is_float(ax) and not is_float(i):
            i = float(i)
        elif is_integer(ax) and not is_integer(i):
            i = int(i)
        elif is_list_like(ax) and not is_list_like(i):
            i = [i]
    
    return key
```

This updated code checks the type of the index and coerces the indexer to the appropriate type if they don't match. This modification should resolve the type mismatch issue and the failing test case.

The updated `_convert_key()` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
