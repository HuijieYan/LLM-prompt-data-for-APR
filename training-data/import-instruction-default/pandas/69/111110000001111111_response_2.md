Potential error location: The bug likely originates from the _convert_key function's conditional statements that check for integer values in the index. These conditional statements are not correctly handling the type checks for the index and the input key.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the incorrect type checking for the index and the input key in the conditional statements of the _convert_key function. This results in the function not correctly handling different types of indices and keys, leading to unexpected behavior in the Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional statements in the _convert_key function to correctly handle different types of indices and keys.
2. Add type checks or conversions to ensure that the index and the input key have compatible types for comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, str)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime or string indexers")
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, int)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta or integer indexers")
            elif isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.Int64Index, pd.RangeIndex)) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax) and not is_scalar(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric or scalar indexers")

        return key
```
This corrected function includes updated type checks to handle different types of indices and keys. It also ensures that the keys are compatible with the index for correct behavior in Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
