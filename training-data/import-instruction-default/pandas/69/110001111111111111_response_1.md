The bug in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file is causing an issue with the `get_value` method for the `Float64Index`. The issue is due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexers.

The problematic part of the code is the `_convert_key` function, where it attempts to verify if the index is an integer and then checks the type of each indexer. However, the condition for checking if an index is an integer is incorrect and is leading to the ValueError being raised.

The failing test in the `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` file is demonstrating that the `get_value` method is not providing the expected results for datetime64 and timedelta64 values, specifically when using a Float64Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the verification of integer and non-integer indexers for both datatime64 and timedelta64 values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the verification of integer and non-integer indexers based on the type of index and datatype of the values being indexed.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # Check the type of index and handle integer and non-integer indexers accordingly
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```

With this corrected code for the `_convert_key` function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. This fix should also resolve the issue as reported on GitHub related to the bug.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file to resolve the issue.
