Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to be occurring in the for loop that iterates over the axes of the object. It is not properly handling non-integer indexes.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the function not properly checking for non-integer indexes in the for loop. The discrepancy between expected and actual input/output variable values is causing the Series lookups to be affected for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for non-integer indexes properly and handle them accordingly in the for loop.
2. Ensure that the function returns the correct types and values for the variables in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if is_integer(i):
                    if not is_integer(ax[0]):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                            "can only have non-integer indexers"
                        )
                else:
                    if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                        raise ValueError(
                            "At based indexing on a numeric index "
                            "can only have numeric indexers"
                        )
            else:
                if not is_list_like(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index "
                        "can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code should address the issues and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue by properly handling the cases with non-integer and non-numeric indexes.
