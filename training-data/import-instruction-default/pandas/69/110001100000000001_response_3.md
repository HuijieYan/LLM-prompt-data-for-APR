The potential error in the function is the use of `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()`. These functions do not exist in the pandas library, which will result in an AttributeError when the function is called.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to call methods that do not exist, resulting in an AttributeError. This means that the program will halt and raise an error when it reaches that particular line of code.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct methods for checking whether a value is an integer or if a series holds integer values. We can use the `pandas.api.types` module, which contains the required functions such as `is_integer_dtype` and `is_integer`. By using these functions, we can properly check if a value is an integer or if a series contains integer values.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
from pandas.api.types import is_integer, is_integer_dtype

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer_dtype(ax.dtype):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not is_integer_dtype(ax.dtype):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function uses the correct methods to check if a value is an integer or if a series contains integer values, thus fixing the bug and preventing the AttributeError that was occurring in the original function.
