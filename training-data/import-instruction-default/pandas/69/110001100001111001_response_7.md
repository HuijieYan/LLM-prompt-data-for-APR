The bug in the function lies in the for loop where it is checking if the axis is an integer. It should check if the index object is an instance of an integer index, rather than checking the type of the index object.

To fix the bug, we can use the `is_integer()` method on the index object to determine if it is an instance of an integer index. Then, we can use the `is_integer` and `is_float` functions to check the type of the indexers and compare it with the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.IntegerIndex) and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.IntegerIndex) and not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```
This corrected code should now handle the input/output variables as described in the expected case 1 and expected case 2.
