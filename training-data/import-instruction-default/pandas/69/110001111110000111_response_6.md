The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key into the same type as the index. The function checks if the index is integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if the key does not match the index type.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method for Float64Index and is triggering the ValueError due to mismatched index and key types.

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes the problem with series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where the index type is float and the key is integer. It raises a ValueError when it should handle this case more gracefully.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the cases of integer and non-integer index types more accurately and gracefully. We'll need to update the logic to check for float and integer types and handle the conversions accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype.type
    # Convert key to match index type
    if is_numeric_dtype(index_type) and not is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, index_type):
            key = index_type(key)
    elif isinstance(index_type, np.float):
        key = float(key)
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should handle the key and index type conversions more accurately and address the ValueError that was occurring in the failing test. This updated function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
