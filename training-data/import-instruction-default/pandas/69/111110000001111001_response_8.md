# The buggy function `_convert_key` does not correctly handle the type checking for the index when dealing with integer and non-integer values. It currently only checks whether the value is an integer, and does not check whether it is a float. This leads to incorrect type checking when dealing with float values, which is the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the index is of type float as well. We can do this using the `is_float()` method from the `pandas.core.dtypes.common` module.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            elif ax.is_float() and not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this change, the function will now correctly handle type checking for integer and non-integer indexes, including float values. It satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided for the failing test cases.
