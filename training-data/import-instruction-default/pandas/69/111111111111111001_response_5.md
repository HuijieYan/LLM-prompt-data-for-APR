The buggy function `_convert_key` is meant to ensure that keys have the same type as the index. However, it currently has an issue with identifying keys as integers or non-integers, causing it to raise a `ValueError` when the types don't align.

After analyzing the failing test, we can see that for both `is_setter` being `False` and `True`, keys are being converted to lists. This makes the check for integer and non-integer keys irrelevant.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for integer and non-integer keys and simply return the key if `is_setter` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    return key
```

With this change, the function should now satisfy the failing test.
