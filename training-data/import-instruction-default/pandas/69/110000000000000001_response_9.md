1. The buggy function is supposed to check if the keys are the same type as the index and raise a ValueError if they are not, depending on the type of the index. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
   - The function is_setter parameter is not used.
   - The is_integer() and holds_integer() methods are not called on the correct objects.
   - The comparison for integer and non-integer indexers does not appear to be correctly implemented.

2. The potential error location is within the for loop where the comparisons are being made between the index and the key.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly checking for the type of the key with respect to the index and is using the wrong methods to do so.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the correct methods on the axis objects to check for integer and non-integer types.
   - Use the is_integer and is_scalar functions from the imported library to check the type of the key.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype) and not is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
        elif not is_numeric_dtype(ax.dtype) and is_numeric_dtype(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```
The corrected code now correctly uses the is_numeric_dtype function to check for the type of the index and the key and raises a ValueError based on the comparison.
