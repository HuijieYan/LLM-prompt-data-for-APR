The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for the error message. This function is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The error message indicates that there is a problem when using `ser.at[4]` with a non-integer index.

The bug is caused by the logic implemented in the `_convert_key` function. It checks for the type of index and key, but the comparison logic seems to have issues when dealing with non-integer indexes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve correcting the comparison logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
