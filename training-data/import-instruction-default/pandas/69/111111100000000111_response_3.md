1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. It is responsible for converting the key to match the type of the index. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which suggests that the issue may be related to the type casting or conversion of keys in the indexing process.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the for loop where it checks for the type of the index and the type of the key.

3. The bug's cause could be that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of the key to match the type of the index. This may result in incorrect indexing for Series with Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the type conversion logic to handle Float64Index correctly.
   - Add additional checks to ensure that the key and index types are compatible.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function _convert_key:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:  # handle arbitrary setting
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric-based indexing on a numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:  # handle non-numeric index
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not is_numeric_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Numeric-based indexing on a non-numeric "
                    "index can only have non-numeric "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes additional checks for numeric-based indexing and handles the type conversion for numeric and non-numeric indexes appropriately. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
