The problematic function `_convert_key` checks whether the keys provided are of the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if they are not. The failing tests are related to the use of float keys on an index containing date or timedelta values, which leads to the ValueError being raised.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for is_integer() on the axis, which should instead be checked for is_numeric_dtype().

The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly validating the keys provided by using the `is_integer()` method instead of validating that the keys are of numeric type.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the validation step to check for numeric type instead of integer type, and modifying the condition to check ax.holds_integer() to ensure non-integer indexes can only have non-integer indexers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_numeric_dtype(ax):
            if not is_numeric_dtype(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an numeric index "
                    "can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_numeric_dtype(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
