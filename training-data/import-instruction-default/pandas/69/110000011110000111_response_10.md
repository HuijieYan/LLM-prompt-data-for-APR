The buggy function `_convert_key` is causing the test to fail. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the case where a non-integer index is provided, leading to a ValueError being raised.

The function attempts to compare the type of the index with the type of the key and raise a ValueError if they don't match. However, it seems to be mishandling the non-integer index case. This is becoming apparent when running the failing test for Float64Index.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes the problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing test due to the mishandling of non-integer index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the comparison logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer index cases.
2. Adjusting the logic to handle non-integer indexes in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function that addresses the issue and passes the failing test:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

The corrected code now properly handles the non-integer index case and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
