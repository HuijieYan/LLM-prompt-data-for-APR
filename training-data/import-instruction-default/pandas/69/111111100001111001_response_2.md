The issue with the _convert_key function is that it attempts to determine whether a key is an integer based on the type of index, but it doesn't handle all possible scenarios. Additionally, it should use the is_integer function provided by the class ax.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if the key is a list-like item and then loop through the items in the key, checking their type against the type of the corresponding index. If the index is an integer index, we should raise an error if the key is not an integer. If the index is not an integer index, we should raise an error if the key is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks for both list-like keys, loops through the keys and corresponding indexes, and correctly identifies whether the key is an integer or not based on the index type. This ensures that the function will now handle all possible scenarios as expected.
