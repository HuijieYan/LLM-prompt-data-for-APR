The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is related to the GitHub issue "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs". The issue describes how converting a categorical series with NaN values to an integer type is resulting in unexpected negative values for the NaNs, rather than converting them to NaN in the integer type. The issue is due to the behavior of the `astype` method when handling NaN values in categorical series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that deals with is_object_dtype (arr) and is_object_dtype (dtype), where the function attempts to handle special cases, such as converting datetime/timedelta array of objects to a proper dtype.

The bug is caused by the `astype_nansafe` function not handling the conversion of categorical series with NaN values to integer type correctly. This leads to unexpected negative values for the NaNs in the resulting integer type.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the special case of converting categorical series with NaN values to an integer type. This may involve checking for NaN values in the categorical series and handling them appropriately during the conversion to integer type.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function that resolves the GitHub issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Modified code to handle categorical series with NaN values
    if hasattr(arr, "categories") and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        if copy:
            arr = arr.copy()
        arr.fillna(np.nan, inplace=True)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This updated version of the `astype_nansafe` function includes a check for categorical series with NaN values and handles them by filling NaN values with np.nan before converting to the integer type.

This corrected code should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" by properly handling the conversion of categorical series with NaN values to integer type.
