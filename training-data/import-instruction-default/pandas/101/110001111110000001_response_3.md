The bug is caused by a check for NaN values when converting a `timedelta64` to an integer within the `astype_nansafe` function. The function tries to convert NaN values to an integer which is not possible, resulting in a ValueError being raised when it should not be.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code that checks for NaN values when converting `timedelta64` to an integer. We should remove this check in the case of `timedelta64` and directly proceed with the conversion. 

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.view(dtype)
        return arr.view(dtype)
        
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
With this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle conversions from `timedelta64` to `int64` without checking for NaN values.

This corrected function should pass the failing test.
