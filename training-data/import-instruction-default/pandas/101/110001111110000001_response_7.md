The issue in the buggy function `astype_nansafe` is that it is not correctly handling the case when the input array contains `NaT` (Not a Time) values and it is being cast to an integer type. It should raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert `NaT` values to integer. However, the function does not handle this case properly, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the input array contains `NaT` values and the target type is integer. If both conditions are met, the function should raise a `ValueError` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function will correctly raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert `NaT` values to an integer type.
