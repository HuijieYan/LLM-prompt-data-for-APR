The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing when trying to convert nans to integer dtype. The function is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, it is failing to handle NaN values properly when converting to integer dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the conversion of NaN values to integer dtype.

The bug is caused because the function is not handling NaN values properly when converting to integer dtype. This is resulting in an incorrect integer value for the NaN.

To fix the bug, the section of the code that handles the conversion of NaN values to integer dtype needs to be modified.

The corrected code for the function `astype_nansafe` is as follows:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
        mask = isna(arr)
        arr[mask] = np.nan  # Update NaN values to NaN
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The corrected code now properly handles NaN values when converting to an integer dtype, ensuring that the NaN values are returned as NaN after the conversion.

This fix should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, as well as address the problem described in the GitHub issue related to converting categorical data to integer dtype.
