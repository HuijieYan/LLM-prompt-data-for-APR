The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion from NaT values of datetime or timedelta types to an integer type. This is evident from the failing test and the error message, which indicates that the function did not raise a ValueError when it should have.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types. We can achieve this by adding a check for NaT values and raising a ValueError if the conversion is not possible.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (same function implementation as before)

    if np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function implementation remains the same)
```

By adding this check, we ensure that the function properly handles the conversion of NaT values to integer types. This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Do note that the corrected function provided above only handles NaT values specifically for the `int64` dtype. Depending on the use case, the handling of NaT values for other data types may need to be added or modified accordingly.
