The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing the test because it is not handling the case where the input array contains the "NaT" (Not a Time) value and we are trying to convert it to an integer dtype. The function should raise a ValueError in this case, but it is not doing so, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the input array contains "NaT" values and if the target dtype is an integer type, and raise a ValueError in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if isna(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With this fix, the function will raise a ValueError when trying to convert "NaT" values to an integer dtype, which will cause the failing test to pass.

Now, the updated function `astype_nansafe` should pass the failing test.
