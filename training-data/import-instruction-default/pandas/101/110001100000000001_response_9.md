Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, it seems that the potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles object dtype. When handling an object dtype, the function attempts to coerce it to a proper dtype and then recalls the `astype_nansafe` function which can potentially lead to an infinite recursion if not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle object dtype in a way that does not lead to infinite recursion. This can be achieved by removing the recursive calls to `astype_nansafe` for handling object dtype and instead ensuring that the object dtype is converted properly before calling the main logic.

Here's the corrected code of the function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype.type, np.integer):
            arr = lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            arr = to_datetime(arr)
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            arr = to_timedelta(arr)
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
    
    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    
    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # rest of the original logic
    # ...
```
By making these changes, we ensure that the handling of object dtype does not lead to infinite recursion and the dtype is properly handled before the main logic of the function is executed. This should fix the bug and prevent any potential issues related to handling object dtype.
