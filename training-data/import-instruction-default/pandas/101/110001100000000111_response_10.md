The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The issue described on GitHub is related to converting a categorical series (which may contain NaN) back into an integer column, where NaN is converted to an unexpected negative value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional block which checks if the input array is of object dtype (`is_object_dtype(arr)`), and then attempts to handle the conversion to datetime or timedelta types. This block may not properly handle NaN values in the categorical series when converting to integer dtype.

The bug's cause is due to improper handling of NaN values when converting from a categorical series to an integer dtype. The function does not properly handle the conversion of NaN to the correct integer or NaN value when casting categorical to int.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the conversion of NaN values properly when casting from a categorical series to an integer dtype. This may involve checking for NaN values before the conversion and mapping them to the appropriate integer or NaN value in the output.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function that resolves the issue:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Check for categorical dtype and handle NaN values appropriately
    elif arr.dtype.name == 'category' and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        codes = arr.cat.codes
        na_index = arr.isna()
        codes[na_index] = pd._libs.missing.NAType
        return codes.values

    # Remaining conditional blocks for datetime64, timedelta64, etc. remain unchanged

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

The corrected code includes a specific conditional block for handling the conversion of categorical dtype to an integer dtype. Inside this block, it checks for NaN values and replaces them with `pd._libs.missing.NAType` before returning the integer representation of the categorical series.

This fix ensures that the NaN values in the categorical series are properly handled when converting to an integer dtype, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
