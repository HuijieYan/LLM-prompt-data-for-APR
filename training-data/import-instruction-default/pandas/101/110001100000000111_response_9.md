The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The issue is related to the function's ability to handle categorical values with nans when casting to an integer dtype.

The cause of the bug is that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, it converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value. This results in unexpected behavior and does not align with the expected output, where NaN in category should convert to NaN in IntX (nullable integer) or float.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle categorical values with NaNs correctly when casting to an integer dtype. This may require adjustments to the logic in the function for handling different data types, specifically categorical data.

Based on the description of the bug and the related issues, it seems that the new version of the function should handle the conversion of categorical data to integer dtype more carefully, ensuring that NaN values are handled appropriately.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # the body of the function remains the same
    # ...

    # fix for categorical data handling
    elif is_categorical(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        # handle categorical data with NaNs appropriately
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy, errors='ignore')

    # ...
```

In this corrected version, a specific check for handling categorical data with NaNs when casting to an integer dtype has been added. This change aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the conversion of categorical data to an integer dtype handles NaN values appropriately.
