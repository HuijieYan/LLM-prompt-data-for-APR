The issue with the `astype_nansafe` function is that when casting NaN values to an integer using `astype`, it incorrectly converts them to a large negative value instead of preserving them as NaN.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that handles the conversion of datetime or timedelta values to integers.

The failing test provided uses a NaN value (NaT for datetime and timedelta) and expects it to raise a ValueError. However, the function does not raise the expected error, indicating that it does not handle NaN values correctly.

The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem when converting categorical series with NaN values to integers, which further supports that this is a known issue with the current behavior of casting NaN to integer.

To fix this issue, we can update the function to correctly handle NaN values when converting datetime or timedelta values to integers by preserving them as NaN.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing function code)

    # Check if dtype is datetime or timedelta
    if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(dtype):
        # If arr contains NaN values, replace them with NaN in the result
        if isna(arr).any():
            result = arr.astype(dtype)
            result[isna(arr)] = np.datetime64("NaT") if is_datetime64_dtype(dtype) else np.timedelta64("NaT")
            return result
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... (remaining function code)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle NaN values correctly when casting datetime or timedelta values to integers, preserving them as NaN. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.
