```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    # Ensure pandas imports are available
    from pandas import to_timedelta, to_datetime
    
    # Replace the line that checks for timedelta64 dtype
    if dtype.name == 'timedelta64' and dtype != dtype.int64:
        if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
            # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)
        return arr.view(dtype)
```
Note: The fix provided here focuses on resolving the issue specifically related to the failing tests. Any other fixes needed for the complete functionality of the function need to be addressed separately by analyzing other relevant failing tests or potential use cases.
