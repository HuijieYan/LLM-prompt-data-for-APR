The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the input dtype properly in the cases where the input array is of type datetime64 or timedelta64. 

The expected input/output variable information suggests that the dtype should be set to 'int64' and the kind and name of the dtype should also be set accordingly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to explicitly set the dtype to 'int64' in the cases where the input array is of type datetime64 or timedelta64.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains as is

    # Cases for handling datetime and timedelta dtypes
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
        dtype.kind = 'i' 
        dtype.name = 'int64'
        # rest of the code for datetime64_dtype

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
        dtype.kind = 'i' 
        dtype.name = 'int64'
        # rest of the code for timedelta64_dtype

    # rest of the function remains as is
```

By explicitly setting the dtype to 'int64' and updating the kind and name attributes accordingly in the cases where the input array is of type datetime64 or timedelta64, we can ensure that the function meets the expected input/output variable information provided.
