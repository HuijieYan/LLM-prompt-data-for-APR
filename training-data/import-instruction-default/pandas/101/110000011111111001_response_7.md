The issue with the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types correctly. When the function is called with an array containing NaT values and the dtype as np.int64, it should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". However, the function does not do this, causing the test to fail.

To fix this, we need to update the function to explicitly handle the case of converting NaT values to integer types and raise a ValueError in those cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this correction, the updated function will explicitly check for NaN values when converting to an integer type and raise a ValueError with the appropriate message. This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
