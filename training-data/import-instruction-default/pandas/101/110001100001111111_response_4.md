The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not handle the conversion of categorical data containing NaNs to an integer type correctly. This is causing unexpected behavior when attempting to convert categorical data back to an integer type, resulting in NaNs being converted to incorrect integer values.

The issue is related to the handling of categorical data and how it is cast to an integer type within the `astype_nansafe` function.

The function should be modified to handle the conversion of categorical data containing NaNs to an integer type correctly, ensuring that NaN values are appropriately handled during the conversion process.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to add a specific check for categorical data and handle the conversion to an integer type in a way that properly handles NaN values.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if dtype in [np.int8, np.int16, np.int32, np.int64]:
            return arr.astype('Int64')

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

The corrected code now includes a specific check for categorical data and handles the conversion to an integer type by using the 'Int64' dtype, which can properly handle NaN values.

By including this check, the corrected function should now properly handle the conversion of categorical data containing NaNs to an integer type, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
