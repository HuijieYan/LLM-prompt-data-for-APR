The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is used for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function appears to have issues with correctly casting categorical data to integers, especially when NaN values are present.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it handles the conversion of object dtype to an integer type, as this is where the unexpected behavior with categorical data may be occurring.

The bug's cause is related to the inappropriate handling of NaN values when casting a Categorical or CategoricalIndex to an integer dtype, resulting in unexpected negative integer values being produced for NaN entries.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the conversion of categorical data, ensuring that NaN values are treated appropriately and not converted to unexpected negative integers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Handle categorical data
    elif getattr(arr, "dtype", None) and getattr(arr.dtype, "name", None) == "category":
        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # Remaining code for handling datetime/timedelta, object dtype, and other cases remains unchanged
    # ...

```

This corrected version includes a specific handling for categorical data, where it directly uses the `astype` method to convert the array to the specified dtype, which should handle NaN values appropriately and avoid the unexpected negative integer values.

By including this fix, the function should now handle the conversion of categorical data to integers correctly, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
