The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` is causing an error when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. This is because NaN in a category is being converted to an incorrect integer negative value. The issue has been reported on GitHub (#28406) and there is a test case provided which is currently failing.

The bug appears to be in the section of the function where it is handling the conversion of NaN values, and the subsequent handling of dtype. It seems that the dtype is being set to `int64` which is causing the NaN to be converted into a large negative integer value instead of a proper NaN representation.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of the dtype and NaN values for Categorical or CategoricalIndex data types.

The corrected code for the function `astype_nansafe` is as follows:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # If the dtype is a Categorical dtype and the arr is a Categorical or CategoricalIndex arr, then need to handle NaNs
    if hasattr(dtype, "categories") and hasattr(arr, "categories"):
        if skipna and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            return arr

        return pd.array(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        msg = (
            f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
            f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle NaN values correctly and no longer convert them to incorrect negative integer values when converting from categorical to integer data types. This fix should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
