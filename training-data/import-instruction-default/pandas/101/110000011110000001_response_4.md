The potential error is likely related to the processing of NaT (not a time) values in the `astype_nansafe` function. Since the failing test is trying to cast a NaT value to an integer type, the error message indicates that the function is not raising a ValueError as expected.

The bug seems to be due to the `astype_nansafe` function not handling NaT values correctly, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should handle NaT values and raise a ValueError as expected when trying to cast NaT to an integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if arr.squeeze() == np.datetime64('NaT'):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

        # rest of the code for datetime64 handling

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if arr.squeeze() == np.timedelta64('NaT'):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

        # rest of the code for timedelta64 handling

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle NaT values correctly and raise a ValueError when trying to cast NaT to an integer type. This modified function should pass the failing test.
