The error arises from the `astype_nansafe` function, which is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test checks for the behavior of the function when dealing with NaT values and converting them to an integer type.

The potential error location in the `astype_nansafe` function is likely in the section that handles the conversion of NaT values to an integer type. This is evident from the error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer."

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when trying to cast them to integer types. The current implementation of the function does not handle this conversion correctly, leading to the test failure and error message.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function should be updated to handle NaT values appropriately when converting to an integer type. This may involve adding specific checks and conditions for NaT values within the integer type conversion logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # Existing function body...
    
    if dtype == np.int64 and is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # Existing function body...

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)
```

In this fix, we've added a specific check for the combination of dtype being np.int64 and arr being of datetime64 type with any NaT values. If this condition is met, the function raises a ValueError with an appropriate message.

With this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test and handle the conversion of NaT values to an integer type correctly.
