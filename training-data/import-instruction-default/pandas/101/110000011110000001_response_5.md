The buggy function, `astype_nansafe`, fails when converting a NaT value to an integer. This failure is evident from the failing test function, `test_astype_nansafe(val, typ)`, which does not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code block:
```python
elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

    if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
```

The cause of the bug is that the condition `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)` does not correctly handle the case where the input `arr` has a NaT value (not a finite floating-point number) and is being converted to an integer. Consequently, it fails to raise a `ValueError` in this scenario.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition to explicitly check for NaT values in the `arr` and raise a `ValueError` accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.inexact):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not isna(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function)
```
This modified code explicitly checks if the input array `arr` contains non-finite values (including NaT values) and raises a `ValueError` accordingly. This corrected function should pass the failing test and handle the scenario where a NaT value is being converted to an integer.
