The potential error in the buggy function lies in the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours.

The bug's cause stems from the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours, which leads to inaccurate datetime manipulation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to ensure accurate calculation of business hours and proper adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

# corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # calculation of business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            (en - st).total_seconds() / 60
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # adjustment of datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            business_minutes = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            remaining_minutes = n * 60 - (businesshours * (n // (businesshours / 60)))
            other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        else:
            business_minutes = other - self._get_closing_time(other)
            remaining_minutes = abs(n * 60) - (businesshours * (abs(n) // (businesshours / 60)))
            other -= timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
