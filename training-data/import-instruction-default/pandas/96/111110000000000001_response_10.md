The potential error in the current code is that the function `apply` is using a decorator `@apply_wraps` which is not defined anywhere in the given code. This is likely causing a NameError when the function is called. 

To fix this, we can simply remove the decorator `@apply_wraps` from the function and return the modified `other` at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (the rest of the function remains unchanged)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function does not use the `@apply_wraps` decorator and simply returns the modified `other` at the end of the function.
