The issue is likely occurring within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is used to calculate the custom business hour for a given date. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using a custom business hour with holidays, but it's producing unexpected results. The error message indicates that there is a problem with validating the frequency when using the custom business hour with holidays.

The cause of the bug could be that the logic in the `apply` function is not properly handling the calculation of business hours when holidays are involved.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic inside the `apply` function and ensure that it correctly handles the calculation of business hours in the presence of holidays. It's likely that the logic for adjusting the business hours is incorrect or incomplete.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour as BusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other functions ...

    # The corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Logic to handle custom business hours
            # ... (original logic)

            # Get the business hours on the given date
            business_hours = BusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
            # Apply the business hours to the given date
            adjusted_date = business_hours.apply(other)

            return adjusted_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected code, we're using the `CustomBusinessHour` class from the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module to properly handle the calculation of business hours with holidays. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue. After making this change, the failing test should pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
