The issue arises from the apply function within the BusinessHourMixin class in the offsets.py file of the pandas library. The apply function is responsible for adjusting the time based on business days and business hours, including business holidays, but it is currently not functioning correctly.

The potential error in the function can be inferred from the GitHub issue, wherein the date_range function does not produce the expected output when using periods and adding holidays, as the holidays are incorrectly affecting the periods.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of holidays and their impact on the periods when adjusting the time based on business days and hours. This is related to the way the apply function is calculating business hours and adjusting the time, leading to the incorrect output observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the apply function needs to be modified to correctly handle the impact of holidays on the periods and ensure that the time is adjusted accurately based on business days and hours, accounting for the presence of holidays.

Here's the corrected code for the apply function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle the impact of holidays on periods
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and isinstance(self.holidays, list):
            holidays = [date.fromisoformat(holiday) for holiday in self.holidays]
            periods_adjusted = 0
            for i in range(abs(self.n)):
                next_date = other + timedelta(days=i)
                if next_date.date() in holidays:
                    periods_adjusted += 1
            other = other + timedelta(days=periods_adjusted) if self.n >= 0 else other - timedelta(days=periods_adjusted)
            
        # the rest of the function's logic remains unchanged
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code includes a new logic to handle the impact of holidays on the periods, ensuring that the time is adjusted accurately based on business days and hours, while accounting for the presence of holidays. This updated function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
