The potential error in the provided code is the use of `@apply_wraps` as a decorator for the `apply` function. The decorator `@apply_wraps` is not defined in the given code, so it will result in a `NameError` when the `apply` function is called.

To fix this issue, the `@apply_wraps` decorator should be removed from the `apply` function. As per the provided code, there is no implementation for the `apply_wraps` decorator, so it should not be used.

Here's the corrected version of the function after removing the `@apply_wraps` decorator:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Rest of the class functions remain the same.

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # rest of the function remains the same
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By removing the `@apply_wraps` decorator, we have fixed the bug in the provided code. Now the corrected `apply` function is without the decorator and can be used without any issues.
