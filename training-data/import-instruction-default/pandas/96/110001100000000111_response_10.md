The buggy function seems to be causing issues when using pandas.date_range with CustomBusinessHour start and adding holidays. This is likely because the apply function is not handling the holidays properly, resulting in incorrect date ranges being generated.

The potential error location within the apply function could be the logic for adjusting the other datetime when adding or subtracting business days or hours. There may be a miscalculation in adding or subtracting the specified business hours leading to the incorrect date range being generated.

The bug's cause is likely that the apply function is not properly handling the addition of holidays when adjusting the datetime for business hours. This results in an incorrect date range being generated when using pandas.date_range with CustomBusinessHour start and adding holidays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing and updating the logic for adjusting the datetime for business days and hours to properly handle holidays.
2. Checking if the apply function is correctly accounting for holidays and adjusting the datetime accordingly when adding or subtracting business days or hours.

Here's the corrected code for the apply function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for holidays
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and len(self.holidays) > 0 and other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            ...
            # (existing logic remains unchanged)
            ...
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes a check for holidays and adjusts the datetime accordingly before performing the business hour calculation, thus addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
