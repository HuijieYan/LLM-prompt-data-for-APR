Based on the buggy function provided and the description of the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue arises due to the function not taking into account the holidays provided when calculating the business hours. This results in an incorrect number of periods being returned when using `pd.date_range` with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` and adding holidays.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of business hours and handling of holidays. The function should adjust the calculation of business hours to account for holidays provided.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the provided holidays in the calculation of business hours. This can be achieved by updating the logic to consider the holiday dates when adjusting the business hours.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that takes into account the provided holidays:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        #... (existing code)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                # Adjust for holidays
                while other in self._holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                #... (existing code)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                # Adjust for holidays
                while other in self._holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        #... (remaining existing code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the code now includes checks to adjust for holidays in the `if n >= 0` and `else` branches. This ensures that the function correctly handles holidays when calculating business hours, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
