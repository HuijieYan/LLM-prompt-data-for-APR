Potential error location: 
The potential error location in the buggy function is the adjustment of the "other" datetime variable to handle the business day calculation and adjustment of business hours. There are multiple conditional statements and adjustments made to the "other" datetime variable, which can lead to incorrect calculations and undesired outputs.

Bug's cause: 
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the "other" datetime variable and erroneous adjustments, leading to inaccurate business day calculations and business hours adjustments. This can result in the function returning incorrect datetime values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the conditional statements and adjustments made to the "other" datetime variable to ensure accurate business day calculations and business hours adjustments.
2. Use helper functions to handle specific parts of the datetime adjustment and calculations, making the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Simplify the logic for adjusting the "other" datetime variable to improve the accuracy of the calculations.

Corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours 
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._adjust_by_business_days(other, skip_bd, bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        other = self._adjust_remaining_business_hours(other, r, n)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements and adjustments made to the "other" datetime variable are refactored to improve accuracy and readability. Helper functions are used to handle specific parts of the datetime adjustment and calculations, making the code more maintainable. The logic for adjusting the "other" datetime variable is simplified to ensure accurate business day calculations and business hours adjustments.
