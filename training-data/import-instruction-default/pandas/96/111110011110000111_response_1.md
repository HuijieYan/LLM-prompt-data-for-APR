The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the section where the `bhour_remain` is being adjusted in the `apply` function.

The bug's cause seems to be the incorrect handling of business hours when using a CustomBusinessHour object with holidays, leading to discrepancies in the expected date range.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Adjusting the logic for handling business hours with holidays in the `apply` function.
2. Verifying the behavior of the `apply` function with CustomBusinessHour and holidays combination.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other functions in the class remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Previous logic remains the same

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)  # use apply method for BusinessDay
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust the business hours based on the current logic
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self.end - other if other.time() in self.end else
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        if other.time() in self.end:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        else:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(
                                self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                            )
                else:
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This should fix the issue and pass the failing test, as well as resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
