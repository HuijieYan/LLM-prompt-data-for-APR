The potential error location in the buggy function is where the `apply` function is using `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` instead of `self.is_on_offset(other)`. This is causing a `AttributeError` as `next_bday` is a method, not an attribute.

To fix the bug, the line `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` should be changed to `self.is_on_offset(other)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... other class methods

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # the body of the function remains unchanged except for the code below

            # ...

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # fixed the bug here
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
