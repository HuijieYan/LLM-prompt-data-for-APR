The problematic function `apply` is failing due to the use of the `BusinessDay` class without importing it, causing an `ApplyTypeError` when trying to execute the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message also indicates that the inferred frequency is None, which indicates that the frequency is not being correctly handled within the `apply` function.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Import the `BusinessDay` class from pandas.tseries.offsets to resolve the ApplyTypeError.
2. Ensure that the frequency is being handled correctly within the `apply` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function incorporating the above fixes:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # code omitted for brevity...

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)  # Import BusinessDay from pandas.tseries.offsets
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # code omitted for brevity...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By importing the `BusinessDay` class and ensuring that it is used correctly within the `apply` function, the corrected code should now pass the failing test.
