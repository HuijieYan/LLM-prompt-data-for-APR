The problematic function is applying business hours frequency to a given datetime. The error message indicates a ValueError is being raised, stating that the inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the frequency is being handled, specifically when it is passed to the DatetimeIndex.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the functionality of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, which starts at "15:00" and has a holiday on "2020-11-26". The test is trying to create a date range using this frequency, but it fails with a ValueError due to an issue with the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the frequency attribute needs to be handled correctly in the apply function. It is likely that the apply function is not correctly applying the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to the issue observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the apply function to ensure that the CustomBusinessHour frequency is properly applied to the given datetime and is handled correctly to avoid any issues with inferred frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the apply function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# ... (other functions remain unchanged)

from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            other = self.apply(other, roll=True)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and applied it using the `apply` method of that frequency class. This should handle the frequency correctly and resolve the issue observed in the failing test.
