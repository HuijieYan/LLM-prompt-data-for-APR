The potential error in the buggy function seems to be the use of `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` where `next_bday` is not defined in the provided code. This could be the cause of the bug, as it is calling a method that does not exist, which would result in an AttributeError.

To fix this, the code needs to be updated to call the `next_bday` method from the same class instead of `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)`.

Here's the corrected code that addresses the potential issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other functions were unchanged

    # this is the buggy function fixed
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # same implementation as before

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

                # corrected line from self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            # same implementation as before

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the buggy line `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` has been replaced with `skip_bd.is_on_offset(other)` to call the `is_on_offset` method from the `skip_bd` object, which is a valid instance of the `BusinessDay` class.
