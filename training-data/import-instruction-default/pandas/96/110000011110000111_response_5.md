The potential error in the provided function is likely located in the logic responsible for adjusting the date and time when the frequency is negative and additional business days need to be accounted for. This could be causing the date_range function to produce more than the specified number of periods, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect adjustment of the date and time when the frequency is negative and additional business days need to be considered. This causes the date_range function to produce more periods than expected, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the date and time when the frequency is negative and additional business days need to be considered should be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the edge cases involving holidays and start times should also be handled correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if the other datetime has any nanosecond value
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        other = as_datetime(other)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
