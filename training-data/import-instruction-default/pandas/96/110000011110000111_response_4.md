The buggy function `apply` is causing issues when working with custom business hours and holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation when adding holidays to a custom business hour frequency.

Based on the error message and the failing test, the issue seems to be related to how the function `apply` adjusts the datetime when adding holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods generated.

The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of datetime when adding holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the `pd.date_range` function. This causes the frequency validation to fail, resulting in the `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the datetime when adding holidays should be revised to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic for adjusting the datetime when adding holidays and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function when using custom business hours and holidays.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # logic for adjusting the datetime when adding holidays
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
            while other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            # original logic for adjusting the datetime
            n = self.n
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # ...
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected `apply` function revises the adjustment of the datetime when adding holidays for the case of `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays. It ensures that the correct number of periods is generated and aligns with the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

Please note that the provided corrected code is a speculative fix based on the analysis of the bug. It might need further testing to ensure that it fully resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
