The buggy function is a method called `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin`. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a ValueError being raised, which causes the test to fail. The error message is related to the validation of frequency in the DatetimeArray, and mentions that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The GitHub issue also provides some details about the problem, stating that when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and adding holidays, it produces more periods than expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be related to the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and holidays. This is likely causing the resulting datetime index to have more periods than expected.

To fix the bug, the error in the adjustment of the `other` datetime object needs to be addressed. This may involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the datetime and handling holidays within the `apply` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start_time, holidays=self.holidays)

            if n >= 0:
                other = other + BDay(n)
                other = freq.rollback(other) if freq.onOffset(other) else freq.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = other + BDay(n)
                other = freq.rollforward(other) if freq.onOffset(other) else freq.rollback(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustments to the `other` datetime object have been modified to utilize the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to handle the holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly. This approach should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
