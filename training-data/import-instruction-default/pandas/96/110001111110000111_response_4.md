The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `apply` function in the pandas CustomBusinessHour class. The failing test 'test_date_range_with_custom_holidays' is related to creating a date range with CustomBusinessHour and holidays, but the output is not as expected and raises a ValueError.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation of business hours when adjusting the datetime with business days and business hours.

To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the calculation of business hours, adjustment of business days, and business hours should be reviewed and corrected. It seems that the main issue lies in the handling of holidays and adjustment of business days and hours.

The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            (end - start).seconds // 3600 for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday()._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)()

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhours = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhours != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour_end = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                bhour = bhour_end - other
                if bhours < bhour:
                    other += bhours
                    bhours = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhours -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(bhour_end)
        else:
            while bhours != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhours > bhour:
                    other += bhours
                    bhours = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhours -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the test should pass and the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should be resolved. This corrected version should provide the expected behavior for the date range with CustomBusinessHour and holidays.
