The potential error in the buggy code is a missing import for the `apply_wraps` decorator and the class `BusinessDay` from the `apply_index_wraps` module. Also, it seems that the buggy function calls the `BusinessDay` from the `self` object, but it should be instantiated first.

To fix the bug, we will need to add the missing imports and fix the code by instantiating the `BusinessDay` object before calling its `is_on_offset` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, _get_calendar, _is_normalized, _to_dt64, apply_index_wraps, as_datetime, roll_yearday, shift_month

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay  # Add the missing import

        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)  # Instantiate BusinessDay object
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):  # fix to call the correct object
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we added the missing import for `BusinessDay`, instantiated the `BusinessDay` object, and fixed the call to `is_on_offset` method by using the correct `skip_bd` object for the check.
