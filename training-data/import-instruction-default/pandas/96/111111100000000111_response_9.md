The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is used to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime. The issue reported on GitHub is related to using `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, where the `periods` parameter does not work as expected when holidays are added.

The potential error in the problematic function seems to be in the calculation of business days (`skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)`), which is resulting in an incorrect output when combined with the `datetime` object.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of business days when processing the offset. There seems to be a miscalculation in the adjustment of business days, leading to unexpected results when combined with the `datetime` object.

To fix the bug, the calculation of business days and the adjustment of the datetime object need to be properly handled. Additionally, the function should account for holidays when performing the offset calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug and should resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other, holidays=None):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                # Initialize BusinessDay with holidays
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=holidays)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The changes include:
- Adding a new parameter `holidays` to the function signature to accept holidays.
- Initializing `skip_bd` using the `CustomBusinessDay` with the provided holidays.
- Using the `CustomBusinessDay` for handling the adjustment of business days.

This corrected version of the function should now handle holidays properly and produce the expected output when combined with the `pd.date_range` function.
