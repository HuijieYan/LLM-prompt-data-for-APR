Upon analyzing the provided information, the potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used for adjusting dates in the `apply` function. The error seems to be causing the `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected when holidays are added.

The bug's cause is the incorrect adjustment of dates within the `apply` function which leads to unexpected behavior when holidays are included in the frequency.

To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised in order to ensure that the dates are correctly adjusted when holidays are present.

The corrected code for the `apply` function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        other = as_datetime(other)
        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other, other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * business_hours), business_hours)

        if n < 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=r * 60)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code aims to adjust the `other` variable correctly based on the business hours and holidays, ensuring that the `pd.date_range` produces the expected number of periods. This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
