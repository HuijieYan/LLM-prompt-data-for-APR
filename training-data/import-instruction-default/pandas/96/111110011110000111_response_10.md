The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the `apply` method, where the adjustment of `other` based on business days and business hours may not be correctly handled, resulting in incorrect output.

The buggy function `apply` is causing the `pd.date_range` to produce more than the expected number of periods when using periods and adding holidays, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function is not correctly handling the adjustment of `other` based on business days and business hours, which leads to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the adjustment of `other` based on business days and business hours, ensuring that the output matches the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` method for the `BusinessHourMixin` class that should resolve the issue:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # ... (existing code remains unchanged)

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd) - 1  # Subtract 1 to account for the current day
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the `apply` method should now correctly adjust `other` based on business days and business hours, ensuring that the output matches the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
