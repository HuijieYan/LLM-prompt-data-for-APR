The potential error in the problematic function is that the `apply` function is using `apply_wraps` as a decorator, but the `apply_wraps` function is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will result in a NameError when the `apply` function is called. 

To fix the bug, the `apply_wraps` decorator needs to be defined or removed from the `apply` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # (previous functions are unchanged)
 
    # this is the corrected function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (body of the function remains unchanged)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected code, the `apply_wraps` decorator has been removed from the `apply` function, as it was not defined in the provided code. The rest of the function remains unchanged.

If the `apply_wraps` decorator is required for the `apply` function, it should be defined and imported before the `apply` function is defined.
