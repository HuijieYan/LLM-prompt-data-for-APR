Upon analysis, it is determined that the bug in the `apply` function is due to an incorrect call to the `is_on_offset` method. The function `is_on_offset` is being called with `self` instead of `other` as the first argument. This results in a TypeError being raised when trying to validate the frequency in the test_date_range_with_custom_holidays test case.

To fix the bug, the `is_on_offset` method should be called with the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that fixes the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (existing code)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):  # Updated this line
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # Updated this line
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... (remaining existing code)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By updating the calls to `self._is_on_offset` with `self.is_on_offset` in the `apply` function, it ensures that `is_on_offset` is being called with the correct arguments.

This corrected version should pass the failing test without any errors.
