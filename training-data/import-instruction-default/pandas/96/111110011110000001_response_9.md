The problematic function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, and it is being called with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the frequency validation. This implies that the issue is likely within the logic for dealing with frequencies or offsets.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is trying to adjust the provided datetime based on business hours and the specified offset, but it seems that it's not handling the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency correctly, leading to a validation error when generating the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function properly handles the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and accurately adjusts the provided datetime based on this frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... [other functions]

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Handle CustomBusinessHour frequency
            if isinstance(self.n, CustomBusinessHour):
                cbh = self.n
                adjusted_time = cbh.apply(other)
                return adjusted_time
            else:
                # Your existing logic for handling other types of frequencies
                # ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, we handle the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency separately by using its `apply` method to adjust the provided datetime. This way, we ensure that the frequency is handled correctly, which should resolve the validation error in the failing test.
