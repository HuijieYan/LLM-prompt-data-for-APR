The problematic function is `apply` which takes `self` and `other` as arguments. The function is intended to handle business hours and adjust the given time `other` with respect to the specified business rules. The function seems to have issues with the business hour calculations, leading to a ValueError while validating the frequency in the failing test.

The cause of the bug appears to be a miscalculation or mishandling of the business hours and days, leading to incorrect adjustments to the input time `other`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review the calculations related to business days and hours, ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly and consistently with the intended business rules.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        result = self.rollforward(other)
        
        if n > 0:
            while result <= other:
                result = self.rollforward(result + CustomBusinessHour(n=1))
        else:
            while result >= other:
                result = self.rollback(result - CustomBusinessHour(n=1))
        
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

In this corrected version, the function 'apply' has been modified to consider positive and negative offsets separately and perform the adjustments using the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods of CustomBusinessHour, ensuring that the correct business hours are taken into account for the adjustments. This corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
