Potential error location: The buggy function is using the `next_bday` attribute without referring to the `self` parameter.

The bug's cause: The `next_bday` attribute is being used without properly referencing the `self` parameter, leading to potential errors in the logic of the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `next_bday` attribute is used with the `self` parameter to access it within the class.
2. Check for other potential attribute or method calls within the function that might also require the `self` parameter.

Corrected code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # check if the next_bday attribute is called using the self parameter
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

        # rest of the code stays the same
        # ...
```
