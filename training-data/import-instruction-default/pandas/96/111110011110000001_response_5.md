The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `apply` method, specifically in the block of code that handles adjustments for negative `n` values. This is where the error message states that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. 

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect adjustment for negative `n` values, leading to an inferred frequency that does not conform to the expected frequency, resulting in a ValueError.

To fix the bug, you can potentially revise the logic for handling adjustments for negative `n` values in the `apply` method. Specifically, you may need to review the logic for subtracting business days and remaining business hours and adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function with the bug fixed
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # (other methods remain unchanged)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing logic
            # ...
            # existing logic

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                if (n >= 0 and bhour_remain < timedelta(0)) or (n < 0 and bhour_remain > timedelta(0)):
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    break

                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
By revising the adjustments for negative `n` values and updating the logic for handling remaining business hours, the corrected `apply` method should now pass the failing test.
