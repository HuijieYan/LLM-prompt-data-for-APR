The buggy function is 'apply' which is a method of the class 'BusinessHourMixin'. It seems that the error is related to the logic implemented in the 'apply' method, which is intended to adjust the given datetime to the business hour including custom business hours.

The failing test 'test_date_range_with_custom_holidays' is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, but it fails with a ValueError related to the frequency. This indicates that the 'apply' method is not adjusting the datetime as per the custom business hour frequency, leading to an invalid frequency error.

The 'apply' method seems to have complex logic for adjusting the datetime to business hours, including the handling of negative business days and remaining business hours to adjust. The issue could be related to the implementation of this logic, leading to errors in adjusting the datetime as per the custom business hour frequency.

To fix the bug, the 'apply' method logic should be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that it correctly adjusts the given datetime to the custom business hours. Additionally, the method should be tested with various custom business hour frequencies to validate its correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the 'apply' method of the 'BusinessHourMixin' class:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods of the class remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            adjusted_time = other.time()
            if n >= 0:
                if adjusted_time in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if adjusted_time in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Adjust for business days
            businessdays = n // 24 if n >= 0 else -((-n - 1) // 24)
            if businessdays != 0:
                other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=businessdays)

            # Adjust for remaining time within business hours
            businesshour_minutes = n % 24 * 60
            if businesshour_minutes != 0:
                hours, minutes = divmod(businesshour_minutes, 60)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + pd.Timedelta(hours=hours, minutes=minutes))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for adjusting the datetime to the business hour frequency has been simplified and modified to handle both positive and negative business days as well as the remaining time within business hours. This should address the issue and make the 'apply' method work correctly with custom business hour frequencies, ensuring that it passes the failing test.
