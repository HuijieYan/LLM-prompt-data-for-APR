The buggy function "apply" is part of the "CustomBusinessHour" class, which is a subclass of "BaseOffset." The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the inferred frequency from the values, which does not conform to the passed frequency "CBH." This suggests that the error is likely related to how the frequency is being handled and adjusted within the "apply" function.

After analyzing the function, it seems that the issue might lie in the logic for adjusting the frequency with business days and business hours. The adjustments for negative values of "n" (self.n) and handling of the "other" datetime object might not be properly aligning with the expected business hour intervals.

To fix the bug, the adjustments and calculations for business days and hours need to be reviewed and rectified. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the "other" datetime object should be refined to ensure it aligns with the business hour intervals.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# Defined class CustomBusinessHour
class CustomBusinessHour(BaseOffset):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction involves refining the adjustments and calculations for business days and hours. The logic for adjusting the "other" datetime object has been modified to ensure it aligns with the business hour intervals, which should resolve the frequency validation issue observed in the failing test.
