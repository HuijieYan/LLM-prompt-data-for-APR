Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the way it is handling business hours and adjusting the datetime according to the business hours.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is likely caused by a miscalculation or incorrect handling of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime according to those hours. This is leading to an incorrect result, triggering a ValueError in the test.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the logic for handling business hours and adjust the datetime accordingly.
2. Check the calculations for business days and remaining business hours to ensure they are accurate.
3. Ensure that the comparisons and adjustments for positive and negative 'n' values are correct.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

  # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

  # Updated corrected version of 'apply' function
  @apply_wraps
  def apply(self, other):
      if isinstance(other, datetime):
          business_day = BusinessDay()
          if self.n >= 0:
              # Get the next opening time
              while other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                  other = self._next_opening_time(other)
          else:
              # Adjust to move to the previous business day
              if other.time() in self.start:
                  other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
              while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                  other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

          businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

          # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
          bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n) * 60, businesshours // 60)

          if self.n < 0:
              bd, r = -bd, -r
          
          other = other + bd * business_day

          # Adjust remaining business hours
          if r != 0:
              elapsed = timedelta(seconds=0)
              for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
                  if start <= other.time() < end:
                      elapsed = (end - other.time()).total_seconds()
                      break
              if self.n < 0:
                  r = -r

              other = other + timedelta(seconds=elapsed + r * 60)
          
          return other
      else:
          raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
