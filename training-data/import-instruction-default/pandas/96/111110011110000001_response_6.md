The problematic function is `apply` inside the class `BusinessHourMixin`. The error occurs because of the incorrect handling of business days when adjusting the given datetime. The function should handle the adjustment of business days properly and calculate the remaining business hours to adjust.

The function `apply` is being used to adjust the given datetime based on business hours and it's incorrect implementation is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function `apply` needs to be modified to handle the adjustment of business days and calculate the remaining business hours properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start = self.start[0]
            end = self.end[-1]
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n >= 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            elif n < 0:
                businessday = BusinessDay(n=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))

                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    incr = 1
                else:
                    incr = -1

                other += incr * timedelta(days=1)
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    n -= incr

            remaining_seconds = (self._get_closing_time(start) - start).seconds

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if r == 0:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
By applying this corrected code, the failing test case should be resolved.
