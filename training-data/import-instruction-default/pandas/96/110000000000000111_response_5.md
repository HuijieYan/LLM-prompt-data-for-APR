The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and it appears to be related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday". The function is used to apply custom business hours to datetime objects, but it seems to be causing issues when holidays are taken into account.

The potential error location within the function is likely the section where it handles adjustments for business days and business hours. This is where the behavior related to holidays and business hour adjustments could be going wrong.

The bug's cause could be that the function is not properly adjusting for holidays when calculating the business hours and days. This is causing the unexpected behavior seen in the GitHub issue, leading to more periods being generated than expected when holidays are included.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly account for holidays when adjusting business days and hours. This may involve revisiting the logic for handling holidays within the function and adjusting the calculations accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    # Your corrections here
    # ...
    # ...

    return other
```

Unfortunately, without further context and understanding of the pandas library and its CustomBusinessHour functionality, it is difficult to provide a specific correction to the function. However, the key point would be to ensure that the function correctly accounts for holidays when calculating business days and hours, as this seems to be the source of the issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
