Issues:
- The apply function is missing a decorator `@apply_wraps` which is not defined in the given imports.
- The main issue causing the failure is a missing attribute in the function that could not be identified within the given source code.
- There are several other functions called within the apply function, and it is unclear if these functions are correctly implemented.

Approach to fix:
- Identify the missing `@apply_wraps` decorator and its source to correctly handle the function appropriately.
- Ensure all the functions called within the apply function are appropriately implemented and called. 

```python
def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return func(self, *args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions here, unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code here

            if not isinstance(self.next_bday, BusinessHourMixin):  # Check if next_bday is an instance of BusinessHourMixin
                self.next_bday = BusinessHourMixin()  # Create an instance if not
            if not all(isinstance(t, datetime) for t in self.start + self.end):  # Check if start and end are all datetime
                raise ApplyTypeError("Business hours start and end must be datetime")  # Raise an error if not
            if not callable(self._next_opening_time) or not callable(self._prev_opening_time) or not callable(self._get_business_hours_by_sec) or not callable(self._get_closing_time):  # Check if other functions are callable
                raise ApplyTypeError("Other functions must be callable")
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
