Bug Analysis:

The buggy function is not properly handling the `CustomBusinessHour` when it is included in the `pd.date_range` function. This is causing the test to fail with the error message related to frequency validation.

The potential error location is within the `apply` function where the adjustments are made to the datetime based on business days and business hours.

Bug's cause:

The buggy function is not handling the custom business hour properly, and the adjustments made for business days and business hours are not conforming to the expected behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the `apply` function to properly handle the custom business hour and make the necessary adjustments based on the given frequency.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            bh = BusinessHour(*self._maybe_cast_to_bhour())
            return bh.apply(other)

        # rest of the code remains the same as provided in the buggy function

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code overrides the `apply` function and makes use of the `BusinessHour` to properly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` when applying it to the datetime. This should fix the frequency validation issue and make the test pass successfully.
