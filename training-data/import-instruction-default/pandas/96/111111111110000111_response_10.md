The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `other` variable in the `apply` function. The issue seems to be related to the handling of holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, which causes the `date_range` function to produce incorrect results when holidays are added.

The bug is caused by the `apply` function not correctly handling the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the business hours. This results in the `date_range` function producing more periods than expected, as shown in the failing test and error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the `apply` function correctly adjusts for holidays when calculating the business hours.
2. Updating the logic for adjusting the `other` variable to account for holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # existing code...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code...

            # adjusted code to handle holidays
            if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start="00:00")
                
            # existing code...

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated code addresses the handling of holidays in the `apply` function by adding an offset of `CustomBusinessHour(start="00:00")` to the `other` variable when a holiday is encountered. This should resolve the issue with incorrect period calculations in the `date_range` function when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays. The corrected code should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
