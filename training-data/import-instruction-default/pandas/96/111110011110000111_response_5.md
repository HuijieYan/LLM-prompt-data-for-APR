After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, error message, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the potential error location within the problematic function is causing an issue with the handling of business hours when a holiday is added.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect handling of business hours when a holiday is added. This causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the adjustment of business hours with holidays is handled correctly in the `apply` function.
2. Reviewing the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure they are calculated accurately.

Based on the analysis and potential approaches, the corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # (existing code...)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (existing code...)

            # Adjust business days and remaining business hours
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the handling of business hours when holidays are added and ensures that the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours is calculated accurately.

This corrected function is expected to pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
