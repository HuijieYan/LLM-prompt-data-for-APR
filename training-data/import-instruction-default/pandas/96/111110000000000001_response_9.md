1. The buggy function is a method called `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin`. It takes another datetime object as input and applies a BusinessHourMixin object to it, adjusting it to the next or previous business hour based on the properties of the BusinessHourMixin object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the while loops that handle the remaining business hours to adjust, particularly in the comparisons and conditions inside the while loops, as well as the calculations of `other`.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect logic inside the while loops that handle the remaining business hours to adjust. The conditions and comparisons may be causing the function to either not properly adjust the datetime object or infinitely loop.

4. A possible approach for fixing the bug is to thoroughly review the logic inside the while loops and the conditions and comparisons used to adjust the remaining business hours. Additionally, ensuring that the datetime object `other` is correctly adjusted in all cases is important.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class after fixing the bug:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # The unchanged part of the function here...

            if n >= 0:
                # Logic for positive n
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # Logic for negative n
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrections include replacing the conditions in the while loops with a comparison against `bhour_remain.total_seconds()` to ensure that the loop progresses properly and avoids infinite looping. Additionally, the adjustments to the `other` datetime object inside the while loops have been corrected to ensure the correct behavior for positive and negative `n`.
