The buggy function is the `apply` function. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message is a `ValueError` that is raised in the `_validate_frequency` method. It is caused by the fact that the inferred frequency is None and it does not conform to the passed frequency CBH.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the part where the `other` object is being calculated. It is possible that the adjustments made to the `other` object are not taking into account the business hours properly, leading to incorrect frequencies.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the calculation and adjustments made to the `other` object. Ensuring that the adjustments properly account for the business hours and frequencies could resolve the issue.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour, CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = list(zip(self.start, self.end))
        business_hour_length = sum((en - st).total_seconds() // 60 for st, en in business_hours)

        if n == 0:
            return other
        else:
            rounding = n // abs(n)

            if other.time() >= self.end[0]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start and self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            days, remainder_minutes = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hour_length)
            if n < 0:
                days, remainder_minutes = -days, -remainder_minutes

            if days != 0:
                if abs(n) == 1:
                    return other + timedelta(days=days)

                bh_offset = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[-1], holidays=self.holidays)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + bh_offset * days + remain
                else:
                    other = other + bh_offset * days

            minutes_left = remainder_minutes
            for st, en in business_hours:
                interval_length = (en - st).total_seconds() // 60
                if rounding > 0:
                    if st <= other.time() < en:
                        minutes_left -= (en - other.time()).total_seconds() // 60
                        if minutes_left <= 0:
                            return other + timedelta(minutes=minutes_left)
                        other = datetime.combine(other, en)
                else:
                    if st < other.time() <= en:
                        minutes_left -= (other.time() - st).total_seconds() // 60
                        if minutes_left <= 0:
                            return other - timedelta(minutes=minutes_left)
                        other = datetime.combine(other, st)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code makes use of corrected calculations and adjustments to the `other` object in order to properly account for business hours and frequencies. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
