The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the `apply_wraps` decorator, which is not defined in the provided imports. This could cause an error when the function is called. 

To fix the bug, the `apply_wraps` decorator needs to be defined or removed from the function.

Here's the corrected code without the `apply_wraps` decorator:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def next_bday(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # rest of the function body remains the same
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By removing the `@apply_wraps` decorator, the code should now work properly without raising an error related to the missing decorator.
