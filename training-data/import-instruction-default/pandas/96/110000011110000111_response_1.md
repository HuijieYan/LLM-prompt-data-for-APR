The buggy function is a decorator that wraps the apply method of Pandas' CustomBusinessHour class. The failing test is related to using the CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays and the error message indicates a problem with validating the frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the implementation of the apply method, specifically in how it handles adjustments and calculations related to business hours and holidays.

The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of holidays when calculating business hours in the apply method, which leads to an incorrect frequency validation that results in the ValueError seen in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Checking and adjusting the code responsible for handling holidays and business hours in the apply method
- Ensuring that the holiday dates are properly considered when calculating business hours and adjusting the datetime accordingly

Here is the corrected code for the apply method:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(calendar=self.calendar, 
                                                       start=self.start,
                                                       end=self.end, 
                                                       weekmask=self.weekmask, 
                                                       holidays=self.holidays).n
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other += pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = pd.offsets.BusinessHour(start=self.start, 
                                               end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).apply(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = pd.offsets.BusinessHour(start=self.start, 
                                                  end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).rollback(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = pd.offsets.BusinessHour(start=self.start, 
                                               end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).rollforward(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = pd.offsets.BusinessHour(start=self.start, 
                                                  end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays).rollback(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
This corrected code ensures that the apply method properly calculates business hours and adjusts the datetime considering the holidays which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
