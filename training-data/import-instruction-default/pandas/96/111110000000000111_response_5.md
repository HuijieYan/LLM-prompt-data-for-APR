The buggy function is a part of a class called BusinessHourMixin, which is related to a GitHub issue about the pd.date_range function not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays. The buggy function is responsible for applying custom business hours to a datetime object. The issue on GitHub suggests that when adding holidays, the pd.date_range function behaves strangely, producing more periods than specified.

The potential error location is likely within the apply function where the logic for adjusting business hours and holidays might be causing the unexpected behavior.

The bug may be caused by the implementation of the apply function in the BusinessHourMixin class, particularly where it adjusts for holidays and business hours. This could result in the unexpected behavior seen in the GitHub issue where additional periods are being generated.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business hours and holidays in the apply function needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it handles holidays and business hours correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the apply function that addresses the bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # rest of the class functions remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
                if self.holidays:
                    other = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, holidays=self.holidays).apply(other)
                else:
                    other = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start).apply(other)
                    
                return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the apply function now correctly uses CustomBusinessHour to apply the custom business hours to the provided datetime object. It also takes into account the holidays when applying the business hours.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on the GitHub and ensure that the pd.date_range function works as expected when using periods and adding holidays.
