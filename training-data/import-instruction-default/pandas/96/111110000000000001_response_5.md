# The buggy function 'apply' is a method of the 'BusinessHourMixin' class. It takes an argument 'other' and attempts to calculate the business hours based on this input. However, there are multiple potential error locations in the function, including the adjustments of the 'other' variable based on the positive or negative value of 'n', the calculation of business days, and the adjustment of remaining business hours.

The potential cause of the bug is the incorrect adjustments and calculations made within the function, leading to unexpected results when trying to calculate the business hours based on the input.

To fix the bug, we can correct the logic used to adjust the 'other' variable based on the positive or negative value of 'n', as well as refine the calculations for business days and remaining business hours.

Here's the corrected code of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd = abs(n) // businesshours // 60
            r = abs(n) % (businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            business_day_adjustment = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday if self._is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) + business_day_adjustment

            remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_business_hours > timedelta(0):
                    remaining_interval = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if remaining_business_hours < remaining_interval:
                        other += remaining_business_hours
                        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= remaining_interval
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_interval)
            else:
                while remaining_business_hours > timedelta(0):
                    remaining_interval = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if remaining_business_hours >= remaining_interval:
                        other += remaining_business_hours
                        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + remaining_interval - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
