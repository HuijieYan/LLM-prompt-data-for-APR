The buggy function `apply` takes another datetime object `other` and performs a series of calculations and adjustments based on the business hours defined by the `self` object.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to use the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with specified start time and holidays to create a date range. The failure is caused by the adjustments performed in the `apply` function not working correctly.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the frequency validation for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, which is caused by the adjustments made in the `apply` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments performed in the `apply` function are correct and do not interfere with the frequency validation of the offset.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `apply`:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n == 0:
            return other

        # Make sure other is a datetime object with nanosecond set to 0
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            0,
        )

        # Calculate the total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        total_minutes = n * 60
        bd, r = divmod(abs(total_minutes), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Skip business days
        if bd != 0:
            business_days = bd * BusinessDay()
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if n > 0 else self.prev_bday.apply(other - timedelta(days=1))
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + business_days

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if r != 0:
            business_hours_in_seconds = business_hours * 60
            if n > 0:
                while r > 0:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    remaining_time = (next_opening_time - other).total_seconds()
                    if r < remaining_time:
                        other += timedelta(seconds=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= remaining_time
                        other = next_opening_time
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remaining_time = (other - prev_opening_time).total_seconds()
                    if abs(r) < remaining_time:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=abs(r))
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r += remaining_time
                        other = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening_time - timedelta(days=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these changes, the corrected `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
