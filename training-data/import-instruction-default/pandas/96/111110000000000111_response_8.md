The problem is occurring when using the `pd.date_range` function with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adding holidays. It produces more than the specified number of periods.

The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class that contains various methods related to business hours. The issue in the GitHub post is related to using business hours with holidays, which aligns with the functionality provided by the `apply` method.

The potential error location within the `apply` method is likely the calculation of business days and remaining business hours. The adjustment of business days and business hours seems to be causing the unexpected behavior when combining business hours with holidays.

The cause of the bug could be related to the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours when adding holidays, causing the calculation to produce unexpected results.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` method. The method should properly handle holidays and adjust the business days and hours accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # other methods from the BusinessHourMixin class...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours
            # ... (existing logic)

            # Adjust for holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to the next opening time after the holiday

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, after the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, we added a check for holidays and move the date to the next opening time after a holiday occurs.

This corrected version should address the issue posted in the GitHub post by properly handling business hours with holidays when using the `date_range` function.
