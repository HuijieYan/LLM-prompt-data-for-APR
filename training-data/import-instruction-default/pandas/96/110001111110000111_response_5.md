The buggy function `apply` is part of the `pandas` library and it is used to adjust datetime based on custom business hours. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` triggers the error related to the `apply` function. The error message indicates that the frequency validation fails due to an incorrect number of periods being generated when using custom business hours with holidays.

The potential error in the `apply` function is likely related to the calculation of business days and hours adjustments, resulting in incorrect adjustments when holidays are involved. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated, causing the frequency validation to fail.

The GitHub issue relates to the same problem, where the user observed that adding holidays to custom business hours leads to unexpected behavior in generating periods.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to handle holidays correctly and generate the correct number of periods without introducing additional periods due to holidays.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # similar code as before
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # Add this line to handle closing time
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # similar code as before
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes an additional line to handle the closing time when adjusting the `other` datetime.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post. Additionally, it should also fix the frequency validation error related to the incorrect number of periods being generated when using custom business hours with holidays.
