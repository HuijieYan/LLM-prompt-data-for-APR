Potential error location: 
The bug may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the logic for adjusting the datetime object to the next business day or business hours. This logic involves checking whether the time is within business hour intervals and then adjusting the datetime object accordingly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for adjusting the datetime object to ensure that it correctly handles both positive and negative offsets.
2. Verify the calculations for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours.

Corrected code:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust the timezone and nanosecond
        other = as_datetime(other)

        # logic for adjusting other based on the offset
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate business hours
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
            for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # adjust based on business days
        business_days = divmod(abs(self.n), business_hours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            business_days = (-business_days[0], -business_days[1])
        
        # adjust for business days
        if business_days[0] != 0:
            other = shift_month(other, months=business_days[0])
            other = roll_yearday(other, days=business_days[1])
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version of the function, the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours has been updated. It ensures that the adjustments are made correctly and handles both positive and negative offsets. Additionally, the calculation of business days and remaining business hours has been revised to provide accurate results.
