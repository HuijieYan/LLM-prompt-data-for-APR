The buggy function is intended to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses this function to generate a date range with custom business hours, and it's failing with a `ValueError` related to inferred and passed frequencies not conforming. This suggests that the custom business hour logic is not correctly handling the holidays and is leading to an incorrect frequency being inferred.

The potential error location appears to be in the logic that handles skipping business days and adjusting remaining business hours. Specifically, the code for adjusting the remaining business hours based on the business time interval and handling of business days seems to be causing the issue with frequency inference.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. This is leading to incorrect frequency inference and causing the failing test to throw a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. The handling of holidays and adjustment of business days needs to be improved to ensure that the correct frequency is inferred.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
        result = pd.date_range(start=other, periods=2, freq=freq)
        other = result[1]

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the `apply` function directly uses the `CustomBusinessHour` to generate the frequency and date range, ensuring that the custom business hour logic is correctly applied. This version should address the frequency inference issue and pass the failing test.
