The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime, but it is not handling holidays correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in the `date_range` function.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles holidays when calculating business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the `date_range` function and ultimately causing the ValueError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic related to handling holidays and adjusting the number of periods needs to be updated. Specifically, the `apply` function needs to consider holidays when adjusting the datetime to reduce the number of cases to handle.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # this is the fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and (other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Handle holidays
            while other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
            # ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue by properly handling holidays in the context of applying the custom business hour offset.
