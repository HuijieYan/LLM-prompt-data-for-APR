1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas/tseries/offsets.py file. The related test function is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py, and the corresponding error message indicates a ValueError related to the frequency validation of the date range with custom holidays.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles adjusting the datetime for business hours and holidays. It seems to be calculating the business hours incorrectly, which results in the incorrect number of periods when holidays are added.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the datetime for business hours and holidays within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test and error message indicate that the datetime index generated by `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour and holidays is not as expected, which suggests a miscalculation in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the holiday.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime within the `apply` method to ensure it correctly accounts for holidays and produces the expected datetime index.
   - Checking the calculation of business hours and how it is affected by the addition of holidays.
   - Verifying that the `apply` method is correctly handling the duration and frequency of the custom business hour with holidays.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class to solve the issue:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # Fix for the buggy apply method
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust the logic for handling custom business hours and holidays
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other += self.freq
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` method should fix the issue and pass the failing test, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
