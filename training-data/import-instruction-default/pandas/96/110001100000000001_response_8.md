Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be in the line `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` which is referencing a non-existent `next_bday` attribute of the `self` object.

Bug's Cause: The cause of the bug is that the `next_bday` attribute is incorrectly referenced in the code. This attribute does not exist, resulting in an AttributeError when the function is executed.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: The `next_bday` attribute needs to be replaced with `self.next_bday` to reference the correct attribute of the `self` object.

Corrected Code:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # remaining code is the same as the original function
        # ...
        # replace the incorrect attribute reference
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            # remaining code is the same as the original function
            # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
