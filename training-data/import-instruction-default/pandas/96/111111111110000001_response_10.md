The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to use the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, but it results in a `ValueError`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset within the `apply` function, resulting in an incorrect output. This is evident from the error message, which indicates a failure in validating the frequency.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=self.end[0].minute)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This code should pass the failing test.
