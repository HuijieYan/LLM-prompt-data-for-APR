The provided code is related to a CustomBusinessHour offset in the pandas library. The failing test is related to creating a date range with custom holidays, and the error is occurring during the validation of the frequency of the date range. The failing test is resulting in a ValueError with a message indicating that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error is likely within the `apply` function as it manipulates datetime objects and is responsible for adjusting the business hours and days. The error message and failing test indicate that the issue is related to the frequency of the date range, which is calculated based on the adjustments made by the `apply` function. 

The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function, resulting in an invalid frequency for the date range.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic of the `apply` function and ensure that the business hours and days adjustments are correctly calculated and applied to the datetime object.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # adjust to next opening time if not on offset
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # adjust to previous opening time if not on offset
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
