The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect use of the `next_bday` function. This function is being called as a method of `self`, but it should be called as a function. This results in a 'self' is not defined error. To fix the bug, we need to call `next_bday` as a function without the 'self' parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def is_on_offset(self, dt):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def is_on_offset(self, dt):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def next_bday(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other functions of the class are unchanged

    # the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # the body of the function remains unchanged except for the following line
            if not next_bday(other).is_on_offset(other):
                # unchanged code
            else:
                # unchanged code
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the `next_bday` function is called without the 'self' parameter, which resolves the bug. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
