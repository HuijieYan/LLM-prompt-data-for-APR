The potential error location within the buggy function is most likely the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect calculations within the while loops for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, we can review and adjust the logic within the while loops to ensure that the calculations for adjusting business days and remaining business hours are accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other class methods)

    # this is the fixed function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
        
            n = self.n

            # adjust other based on the sign of self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # handle adjusting by business days
            if bd != 0:
                business_day_offset = timedelta(days=bd)
                other = self.next_bday(other) + business_day_offset

            # handle adjusting remaining business hours
            business_hours_offset = timedelta(minutes=r)
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while business_hours_offset > timedelta(0):
                time_until_closing = self._get_closing_time(opening_time) - other

                if time_until_closing <= business_hours_offset:
                    business_hours_offset -= time_until_closing
                    other = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                else:
                    other += business_hours_offset
                    business_hours_offset = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
Please note that the fixed code assumes that the methods `self._next_opening_time`, `self._prev_opening_time`, `self._get_business_hours_by_sec`, `self._get_closing_time`, `self.next_bday`, and `self._is_on_offset` are implemented correctly and return the expected results.
