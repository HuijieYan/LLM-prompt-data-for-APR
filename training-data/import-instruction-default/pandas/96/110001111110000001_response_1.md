The problematic function `apply` within the pandas.tseries.offsets module is intended to apply the business hour offset to a datetime object. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is supposed to create a date range with custom business hours, but it fails with a ValueError involving frequency validation.

The potential cause of this bug is that the `apply` function in pandas.tseries.offsets module has an incorrect implementation of applying the business hour offset to a datetime object, leading to incorrect results and causing the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified. We need to ensure that the logic inside the function correctly applies the business hour offset to the datetime object, and the resulting datetime object conforms to the expected frequency.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start = self.start
        end = self.end

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
