### Bug Analysis
The issue is with the `freq` parameter in the `pd.date_range` function when using `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` with the 'holidays' parameter. It causes the date range to include more periods than specified.

The failing test is attempting to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday, but it results in an incorrect frequency that exceeds the expected number of periods.

The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation, specifically that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where adding holidays to a date range results in more periods than expected.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` implementation, particularly in the `apply` function where adjustments are made based on the input date.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, leading to incorrect adjustments and an inconsistent frequency pattern.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Review and update the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
2. Ensure that the adjustments made for holidays do not affect the overall frequency pattern.
3. Verify that the date range generation applies the holiday logic correctly with the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Code
Based on the analysis, the `apply` function for the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be updated to address the holiday issue. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if other in self.holidays:
                # if the input date is a holiday, skip to the next custom business hour
                other += self
                return other

            return super().apply(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

When using the corrected function, it should now handle holidays correctly and produce the expected date range without including additional periods. This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
