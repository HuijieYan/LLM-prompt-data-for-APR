Based on the error message, the issue seems to occur when a CustomBusinessHour is used in the pandas.date_range function. The error message suggests that the frequency is not compatible with the values, and it complains about the frequency not conforming to the passed frequency. This indicates that the problem lies within the apply function that handles custom business hours. 

The potential error location is the section of code that handles adjustments for negative numbers of business hours. The if statement `if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):` and its corresponding else block could be causing the issue as it tries to adjust the business hours based on the current business day.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to revisit the logic where the adjustments are made for negative business hours and ensure that the adjustments do not conflict with the expected behavior when using CustomBusinessHour.

Here is the corrected code for the apply function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            return self.rollforward(other)
        else:
            n = self.n
            base_time = other
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    base_time = base_time + timedelta(days=1)
                    if base_time.weekday() < 5:
                        n = n - 1
                return base_time
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    base_time = base_time - timedelta(days=1)
                    if base_time.weekday() < 5:
                        n = n + 1
                return base_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, the logic for adjustments based on positive and negative numbers of business hours has been simplified to correctly handle the business day adjustments. This should resolve the compatibility issues when using CustomBusinessHour.
