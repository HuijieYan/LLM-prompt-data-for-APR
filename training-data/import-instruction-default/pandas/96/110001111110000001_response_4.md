Looking at the error message, it seems the issue is related to the CustomBusinessHour frequency. The failing test is trying to create a date range with a CustomBusinessHour frequency starting at '2020-11-25 15:00' and with a length of 4 periods. The error indicates that the frequency is not conforming to the expected values. This can be due to the apply method in the CustomBusinessHour class not working as expected.

To fix this bug, the apply method needs to be adjusted to handle different cases based on the input arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the apply method in the CustomBusinessHour class:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Other functions from the same file, but not the same class, are omitted for brevity

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0 and (other.hour, other.minute) >= self.start:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 or (other.hour, other.minute) < self.start:
            # modification to move to the previous business day
            other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0], minute=self.start[1], second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(hours=-24)

        # Calculate the business hours in a day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other += timedelta(days=bd)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            if n < 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0], minute=self.start[1], second=0, microsecond=0) - timedelta(days=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the apply method should address the issue with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and make the failing test pass.
