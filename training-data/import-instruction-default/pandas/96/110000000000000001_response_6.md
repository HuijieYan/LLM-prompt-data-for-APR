Potential error location: 
- The function seems to be designed to adjust a datetime object by a certain number of business hours. However, there are multiple conditional statements and loops that could potentially lead to incorrect adjustments.

Bug's cause:
- The bug may be caused by the conditional statements and loops that are intended to adjust the datetime object by business hours. These statements and loops may not be handling all edge cases correctly, leading to potential incorrect adjustments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional statements and loops to ensure they handle all edge cases correctly.
2. Simplify the logic for adjusting the datetime object by business hours to make it more robust and easier to debug.

The corrected code:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = []

        for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
            business_hours.append((start, end))

        adjusted_time = other
        if n >= 0:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
        else:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):

                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

        total_business_hours = sum(
            (end - start).seconds / 60 for start, end in business_hours
        )

        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours)

                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= business_hours_left

                    )
