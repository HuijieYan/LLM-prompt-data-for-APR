The buggy function is the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is used to apply business hours offset to a given datetime. The failing test is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours with holidays.

The error is likely occurring due to incorrect adjustment of the datetime when applying the business hours offset, which results in unexpected behavior when holidays are involved during the application of business hours.

The bug's cause is related to the business hour adjustment logic within the `apply` function, where incorrect adjustment of the datetime is leading to unexpected behavior when holidays are involved.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the datetime during the application of business hours needs to be corrected to handle holidays properly. This involves ensuring that the logic for applying business hours considers holidays when adjusting the datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust datetime for holidays
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self.next_bday(other)

        # rest of the logic for applying business hours offset
        # ... (existing logic remains the same)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment of the datetime now considers holidays by using the `self.holidays` attribute to check if the given datetime falls on a holiday. If it does, the `next_bday` function is used to find the next business day.

This correction should ensure that the `apply` function handles holidays properly and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
