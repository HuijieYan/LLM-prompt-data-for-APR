1. The buggy function `apply` appears to be designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and business days. It calls several related functions within the same file, such as `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, `next_bday`, and `_is_on_offset`. These related functions are used to manipulate the datetime object and calculate business hours and days.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the while loops where it's attempting to adjust the business hours.

3. The bug's cause seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the business hours and business days. The while loops contain complex logic for adjusting the business hours, and there may be discrepancies in the calculations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug might include:
   (a) Verifying the logic within the while loops to ensure the correct adjustment of business hours.
   (b) Reviewing the usage of related functions to guarantee that they are providing accurate values for business hours and days.
   (c) Testing the function with different datetime objects and business hour scenarios to identify specific cases where the bug occurs.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # business hours calculation
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # adjust business hours based on the value of n
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
