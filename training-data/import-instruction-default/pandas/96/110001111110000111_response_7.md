The potential error location within the buggy function is the section where the adjustment of the business hours is taking place. It seems that the calculation for business days and remaining business hours may not be handling the custom business hour frequency properly, resulting in an incorrect number of periods generated by the date_range function.

The failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" is encountering a ValueError related to the frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency when using CustomBusinessHour with holidays.

The GitHub issue mentions that adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour frequency causes the date_range function to produce more periods than expected, indicating that there is a problem with how the holidays are being handled in combination with the frequency.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours within the "apply" function is correctly handling the custom business hour frequency and holidays.

Here's the corrected code for the "apply" function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        result = other

        if self.holidays and any(holiday == other.date() for holiday in self.holidays):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Holiday encountered")

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                result += timedelta(hours=1)
                if result.hour == 17:
                    result += timedelta(days=1)
                if result.weekday() == 5:
                    result += timedelta(days=2)
                n -= 1
            else:
                result -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if result.hour == 16:
                    result -= timedelta(days=1)
                if result.weekday() == 6:
                    result -= timedelta(days=2)
                n += 1

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In this corrected version, we are explicitly checking for holidays and adjusting the business hour accordingly. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

After applying this correction, the failing test "test_date_range_with_custom_holidays" should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
