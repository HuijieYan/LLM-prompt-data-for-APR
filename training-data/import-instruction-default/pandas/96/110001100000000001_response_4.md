The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to call `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` which is an attribute 'next_bday' of 'self' but it is trying to access 'is_on_offset' method which does not exist. This could be an unintended mistake.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the `self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)` and replace it with a different condition or method call that implements the intended functionality.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
