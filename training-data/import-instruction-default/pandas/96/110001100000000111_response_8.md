1. The buggy function is the apply() function from the CustomBusinessHour class within the pandas/tseries/offsets.py file. The function is supposed to adjust the given datetime value to the next or previous business hour based on the custom business hour offset. The issue is related to the behavior of the date_range function when using periods and adding holidays.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset and the handling of holidays. It seems like the function is not properly accounting for holidays, which results in an incorrect number of periods being generated.

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect behavior of the apply() function in handling holidays when used with the date_range function. The apply() function does not properly handle the impact of holidays on the number of periods in the date_range output, leading to an incorrect result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding proper holiday handling logic within the apply() function to adjust the datetime values based on the provided holidays.
   - Updating the business hour offset logic to correctly account for holidays and the specified number of periods.

5. Here's the corrected code for the apply() function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holidays
        if getattr(other, 'date', None) in self.holidays:
            raise ValueError("Holiday detected")
        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code includes a check for holidays within the datetime, and if a holiday is detected, it raises a ValueError. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Please note that this fix assumes that the CustomBusinessHour class has a `holidays` attribute that contains the list of holidays to be considered. If the holidays are passed through other means, the implementation may require adjustments.
