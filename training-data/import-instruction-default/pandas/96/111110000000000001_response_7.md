The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code that handles adjustment of business hours for positive and negative values of `n`. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours seems to be incorrect, causing the function to produce incorrect output for certain cases.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of positive and negative values of `n` in the code that adjusts the business days and remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be rewritten for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours based on the business hours of the given business time interval.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):


    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # (existing code for handling datetime)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_opening - other
                    if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = next_opening
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = closing_time - other
                    if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment of business days has been improved to handle edge cases correctly, and the remaining business hours are adjusted based on the business hours of the given business time interval for both positive and negative values of `n`.
