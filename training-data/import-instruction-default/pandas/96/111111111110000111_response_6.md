1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
   - The failing test is testing the behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.
   - The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during frequency validation.

2. Potential error location:
   The issue seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the `apply` function, as it results in an incorrect number of periods when holidays are included.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustment of the date range when holidays are specified.
   (b). The `BusinessHourMixin` class is where the `apply` method is defined, and the related functions it calls might also be contributing to the issue.
   (c). The related functions in the same class are responsible for adjusting business hours, but they might not be adequately handling the presence of holidays.
   (d). The failing test is expecting a specific date range with holidays, but the function is not producing the expected result.
   (e). The GitHub issue highlights that adding holidays in the date range with `CustomBusinessHour` is producing unexpected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the `apply` function to accurately account for holidays when adjusting the date range.
   (b). Ensure that the related functions within the `BusinessHourMixin` class handle holidays appropriately.
   (c). Check if the offset calculations are taking into account the presence of holidays.
   (d). Update the date range generation logic to consider holidays when calculating the periods.
   (e). Address any potential issues in the validation of the frequency.

5. Corrected code for the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # ... (other methods remain unchanged)

    # Updated and corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # Adjust the logic to handle holidays when adjusting the date range
            # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

            # Corrected logic to handle holidays in the date range adjustment
            exclude_dates = [d.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) for d in self.holidays]

            if self.start in exclude_dates or self.end in exclude_dates:
                # Adjust the start and end dates based on holidays
                adjust_days = sum(1 for d in exclude_dates if self.start < d < other)
                other += timedelta(days=adjust_days)

            # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making changes to the logic within the `apply` function to appropriately handle holidays and adjusting the date range, the corrected code aims to resolve the issue and pass the failing test. This correction should also address the problem highlighted in the GitHub issue related to adding holidays in the date range with `CustomBusinessHour`.
