The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring due to a problem with the tuple names in the multiindex. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert the passed tuple into a list of tuples

    clevel_idxs = [index._get_level_number(tup[0]) for tup in clocs]
    rlevel_idxs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_idxs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_idxs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlevel_idxs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_idxs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlevel_idxs]

    # ... (remaining implementation unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modification to handle the case where the `clocs` parameter is a tuple. It converts the tuple into a list of tuples and then further processes the data accordingly.

By implementing this fix and using the corrected function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, the failing tests should be resolved.
