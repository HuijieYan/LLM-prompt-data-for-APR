The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex names when unstacking. The function is trying to extract the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` for each level, but it's failing to handle MultiIndex names properly, which is leading to errors like "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" and "KeyError: 'Level A not found".

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for extracting the level number from the MultiIndex names and ensure that it handles both tuple and string names properly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for extracting the level number to handle both tuple and string names in MultiIndex.
2. Handle the extraction of level numbers and names properly to avoid the errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (list, tuple)) else index.names.index((i,)) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, (list, tuple)) else index.names.index((i,)) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```  

The corrected function includes handling for both tuple and string names in the MultiIndex, ensuring that the level number is extracted correctly.

This fix should resolve the issue and the corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version. It should pass the failing test and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
