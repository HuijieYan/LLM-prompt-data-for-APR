The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names. The function attempts to get the level number of each element in the `clocs` tuple, but it fails because the elements are tuples themselves. This leads to a ValueError followed by a KeyError.

The issue is caused by the function attempting to get the level number of a tuple element in `clocs`, where `level` is considered as the tuple name, resulting in the errors.

The potential error location is identified as the line where the function tries to get the level number for each element in the `clocs` tuple.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the `clocs` tuple contains tuple names within it. This can be achieved by iterating through the `clocs` tuple and properly extracting the level number for each element.

In addition, the function needs to be adjusted to handle both single level and multi-level unstacking, as in the failing tests, "unstack_idx" will contain both a single `str` tuple and a tuple of `(str, str)`.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Check if clocs is a tuple, indicating a single level unstack
    if not isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        # Perform unstack on single level
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    # Otherwise, iterate through clocs and handle multi-level unstack
    for loc in clocs:
        level_number = data.index._get_level_number(loc)
        # Perform unstack for each level, updating clocs index
        data = data.unstack(level_number, fill_value=fill_value)
        # Update the remaining level numbers in clocs
        clocs = [i if i < level_number else i - 1 for i in clocs]

    return data
```

With this updated code, the function should handle both single level and multi-level unstacking, passing the failing tests and properly resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
