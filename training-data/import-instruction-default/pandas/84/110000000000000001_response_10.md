The potential error in the code is the section that handles the case when data is a DataFrame and when it is a Series. This part seems to be handling unstacking based on multiple columns and is currently resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can re-implement the logic for unstacking the DataFrame and Series when multiple columns are involved.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # get the index
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # store the indices for clocs and rlocs
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(ccodes, shape=[len(x) for x in clevels], xnull=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, [len(x) for x in clevels], ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # unstack the DataFrame based on clocs
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        unstacked = result

        # modify the MultiIndex for columns
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=ccodes + [comp_ids],
            names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False
        )
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By re-implementing the logic for unstacking and modifying the MultiIndex for columns, we have addressed the potential bug in the original function. The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
