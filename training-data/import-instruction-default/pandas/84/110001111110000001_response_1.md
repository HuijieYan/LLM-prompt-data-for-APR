The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple` from the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The error occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` which suggests there's an issue with how the `index._get_level_number` function is being used.

The failing tests are testing the `unstack` method with a multi-level index, and the error message indicates that the issue is with the index level name not being found.

The issue is likely caused by the function `_get_level_number` not being able to find the level name in the multi-level index, leading to a `KeyError` or a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the level name is present in the multi-level index before trying to get its number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else None for i in clocs]

    # Check if any level name is not found in the index
    if None in cloc_numbers:
        raise KeyError(f"One or more levels not found in MultiIndex")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function body...
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the case where a level name is not found in the MultiIndex, and it should pass the failing test cases.
