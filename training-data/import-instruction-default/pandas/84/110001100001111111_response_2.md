The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to stem from the incorrect processing of the tuple `clocs` when extracting its level number from the index. This leads to issues with handling MultiIndexed data.

The root cause of the bug is found in the `_unstack_multiple` function. In the original code, when determining the level number of the entries in `clocs`, they need to be obtained by looking up the level names in the index. However, the current implementation attempts to get the level number directly, which causes a KeyError when a tuple is passed. This does not account for the specific behavior of MultiIndex.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and extract the level numbers differently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = tuple(index._get_level_number(c) if c in index.names else c for c in clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to see if `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, we use a different method to extract the level numbers from the index. This should address the issue and allow the function to handle MultiIndexed data correctly.

Using this corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread. It accounts for the specifics of MultiIndex and should handle both tuples and single-level values in `clocs` properly.
