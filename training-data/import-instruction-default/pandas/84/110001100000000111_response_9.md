Potential error location:
The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` in the `_unstack_multiple` function might be causing the KeyError.

Bug's cause:
The bug is causing a KeyError because the `_get_level_number` method in the `Index` class is not correctly handling the tuple names when unstacking, as shown in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handling the tuple names correctly when calling `_get_level_number` method for MultiIndexes.
2. Checking if the level is a tuple and then extracting the level numbers appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged from here
```

The corrected function now handles tuple names correctly when getting the level numbers for unstacking, thereby resolving the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
