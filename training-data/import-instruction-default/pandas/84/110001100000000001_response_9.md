The potential error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely in the block of code that handles the unstacking of the data. It seems like there is a mix-up between the unstacking of a Series and unstacking of a DataFrame, leading to incorrect manipulation of the index and columns.

The approach for fixing the bug would involve restructuring the code to ensure that the correct unstacking process is applied for both Series and DataFrames. Additionally, handling of hierarchical columns should be addressed to avoid any potential issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(data.index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(index.codes, clocs, index.nlevels)
        comp_ids = np.arange(len(obs_ids))
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels[rlocs] + [obs_ids],
            codes=index.codes[rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=index.names[rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the dummy index is modified to match the number of levels and codes for both Series and DataFrames. This helps in ensuring that the unstacking process is consistent and accurate for different data types. Additionally, the unstacking process for DataFrames is simplified and generalized to handle hierarchical columns properly.
