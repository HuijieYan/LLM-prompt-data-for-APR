The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, but it seems to be encountering issues with the level numbers and names. The failing test cases mention errors related to multiindex, level names, and the unstacking process. The error messages indicate that the function is trying to obtain the level number for the 'A' while 'A' is not in the list, and a KeyError is raised for the same level.

This indicates that there is a problem with extracting the level information from the index, as it seems to be unable to find the specific level in some cases. It's likely that the function is not handling MultiIndex structures correctly and is failing when trying to manipulate or unstack them.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the function can correctly handle MultiIndex structures, extract level information, and perform unstacking operations, while also accounting for the names and number of levels present.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        names = index.names or [None]  # If no names are provided, use [None]

        # Extract level numbers from the index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels,  # Use existing levels for the unstacked index
            codes=index.codes,  # Use existing codes for the unstacked index
            names=names,  # Use existing names for the unstacked index
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

        # Create a dummy DataFrame with the unstacked index
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        # Perform unstacking
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(list(clocs), fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked

    else:
        # If not a MultiIndex, return the unaltered DataFrame
        return data
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for MultiIndex to correctly handle the unstacking process. It extracts the level numbers, creates a dummy unstacked index, creates a copy of the DataFrame with the unstacked index, and then performs the unstacking operation. This approach should address the issues related to the buggy behavior and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
