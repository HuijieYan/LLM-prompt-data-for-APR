The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`. It takes `data` as input, which is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. It also takes `clocs` as input, which is a tuple of column levels to unstack.

The error is occurring in the block of code where `clocs` is being processed. The error message indicates that the name "A" is not found, which suggests that there is an issue with how column levels are being indexed.

The failing test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` include different examples of input and expected output for the unstacking operation.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the column levels during unstacking. The `_get_level_number` method is used to find the index of a level in the MultiIndex, and it is failing. This likely leads to an incorrect unstacking operation, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the column levels during unstacking and ensure that the indices are retrieved properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process clocs
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs[0])

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the `unstack` method of the DataFrame, taking `clocs` as the parameter to unstack. This implementation should ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly and passes the failing test cases.
