1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue as it causes KeyError when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.

2. The potential error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function when it tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`, based on the GitHub issue description.

3. The bug is caused because the `index._get_level_number(i)` is looking for a single level, but the input `i` in the GitHub Issue is a tuple of names, which results in the KeyError. The function is not designed to handle MultiIndex with tuple names, leading to this error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names by appropriately parsing the input.
   - Adjust the logic to handle both single level and tuple names as input for unstacking MultiIndexed Series.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs is an iterable of tuples
    if all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels)
    else:
        # Original unstack logic
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
        # Remaining logic follows...
```
