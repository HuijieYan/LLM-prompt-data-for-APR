The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to properly handle the multiple levels in the `MultiIndex` when using tuple names. The error is occurring when attempting to get the level number for the tuple name 'A'. The function is unable to handle the tuple names correctly, leading to a KeyError. The issue occurs due to the implementation of `_get_level_number`, which is failing to correctly handle tuple names and raise an error instead.

To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly handle tuple names and return the level number for each component of the tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected code, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex and avoid the KeyError issue raised in the failing test. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
