The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of multi-level indexes. The function attempts to unstack the data based on the specified clocs, which represent the column levels to unstack. However, it fails to correctly reconstruct the index and columns of the unstacked DataFrame.

The issue seems to be with the construction of the new index and columns after unstacking. The function fails to properly handle multi-level indexes and columns, leading to incorrect restructuring of the data.

To fix this bug, the function needs to accurately reconstruct the index and columns of the unstacked DataFrame based on the specified clocs and the original index structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # No remaining levels, so the resulting index should be a regular Index
        new_index = index.to_flat_index()
    else:
        # Reconstruct the MultiIndex based on remaining levels
        new_index_values = []
        for i in range(len(index)):
            rvals = [index.levels[j][index.codes[j][i]] for j in rlocs]
            new_index_values.append((*rvals, *index[i]])

        new_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(new_index_values, names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + [index.names[i] for i in clocs])

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    unstacked.index = new_index

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now accurately unstack the data based on the specified clocs and reconstruct the index and columns of the unstacked DataFrame to match the expected values in all the provided test cases.
