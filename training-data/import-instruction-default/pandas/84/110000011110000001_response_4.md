The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is attempting to unstack a DataFrame based on the given `clocs` values, which represent the columns to unstack. The bug likely occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where the `_get_level_number` method is trying to find the index of the specified level, but it's raising an error when the level isn't found. This is evident from the error `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` and `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`, which indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the names list.

To fix this bug, the code should handle the situation when the level is not found, and the index should be retrieved based on the level name. 

Additionally, there is a possibility that the code may not be properly handling hierarchical columns yet, as indicated in the comments. This should be investigated and addressed to ensure correct unstacking in the case of hierarchical columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else -1 for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clocs = [i for i in clocs if i != -1]  # Remove non-existent levels

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected code should handle the scenario when the specified level is not found in the index names. It should fix the KeyError and ValueError issues encountered in the failing test cases.
