The issue seems to be happening when the input `clocs` contains a tuple of strings representing multi-index levels. The current implementation assumes that `clocs` contains integers representing the level number, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` inputs provided should be converted to level numbers before being used in the function `_unstack_multiple`. This can be achieved by mapping the string tuples in `clocs` to their corresponding level numbers using the `index` argument and its method `_get_level_number`. 

The fixed code ensures that the correct level numbers are used in the subsequent operations.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert string tuples in clocs to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this fix, the function should correctly handle both single-level and multi-level columns, matching the expected behavior in the failing tests.
