The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack hierarchical columns in a DataFrame. The error message indicates that an attempt is made to get the level number of a MultiIndex, which leads to a KeyError or ValueError. 

The error likely occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where `clocs` is a list of levels from the MultiIndex. It seems that the function `_get_level_number` is unable to handle the tuple of names correctly.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class to handle the tuple of names correctly.
2. Update the `clocs` assignment in the `_unstack_multiple` function to ensure it retrieves the level numbers correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Update clocs retrieval and handle the tuple of names correctly
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs[0]]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This fix should address the issue and make the `_unstack_multiple` function capable of handling a tuple of names correctly, thus passing the failing test.
