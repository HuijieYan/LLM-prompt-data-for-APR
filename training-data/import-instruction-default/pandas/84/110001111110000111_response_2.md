The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the KeyError while trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The issue seems to be within the section where the variable `clocs` is being processed. The `clocs` variable is being used to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` and it is failing to find the level when the level is specified as a tuple name.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the logic for extracting the level number in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):  # Check if clocs contain tuple names
        level_numbers = [index.get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]  # Get level numbers for tuple names
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # Get level numbers for other cases

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in level_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in level_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the `clocs` variable contains tuple names. If it does, it will use the `index.get_level_number(c)` method to get the level numbers for the tuple names. Otherwise, it will use the previous logic to find the level numbers. The rest of the function remains the same.

This corrected version of the function should now handle the unstacking of MultiIndexes with tuple names properly and should fix the KeyError issue.

Once the corrected function is applied, it should effectively resolve the issue identified in the GitHub report and accurately pass the failing test cases.
