The problem is occurring in the `_get_level_number` function, specifically at the line `level = self.names.index(level)` where it raises a `ValueError`. This indicates that the level name `('A', 'a')` cannot be found within the MultiIndex names, causing the test to fail.

The issue seems to be with the way the `level` is being derived from the `clocs` variable in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Based on the expected input/output variable information, we can see that `clocs` is a tuple containing the level names ("A", "a") and "B".

The function `_get_level_number` seems to expect a single level name, but in the failing test, it is receiving a combination of multiple level names in the form of a tuple.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case of multiple level names provided as a tuple. We should iterate through the tuple and retrieve the level numbers for each name. Then, we can use these numbers to proceed with the unstacking operation.

Another improvement could be to dynamically determine whether the provided `clocs` value is a single level name or a tuple of level names, and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle multiple level names
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            loc_number = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in loc]
            level_numbers.append(tuple(loc_number))
        else:
            level_numbers.append(data.index._get_level_number(loc))

    # Proceed with unstacking
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle both single level names and tuples of level names, as in the case of the failing test, and pass the test successfully.
