## Bug Analysis:
The error is occurring because the function `_get_level_number` is trying to find the level name within the list of names, but the parameter passed to it is a tuple ("A", "a") instead of a string. This is causing the function to error out and raise a KeyError.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is not correctly handling the case where the level name is passed as a tuple instead of a string. This is leading to the error when attempting to unstack the multiindex with tuple names.

## Possible Approaches:
1. Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where the level name is passed as a tuple.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the level number for both single string and tuple names.

## Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # handle level name passed as tuple
        clocs = index._get_level_number(clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

The above correction handles the case where the level name is passed as a tuple by converting it to the corresponding level number. This modification should resolve the KeyError issue and ensure that the function works correctly with tuple names in the multiindex.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
