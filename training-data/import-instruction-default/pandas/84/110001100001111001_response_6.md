The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is likely caused by an incorrect manipulation of the indices and column levels. The function seems to be attempting to unstack a multi-level index and create a new multi-level column. However, there are inconsistencies in the expected and actual output, such as incorrect levels and codes for the new columns.

To fix the bug:
- The function should correctly identify the levels and codes for the new columns based on the input parameters and data index.
- It should properly handle the multi-level indices and columns to ensure the unstacking operation is performed accurately.
- The conditional statements for `Series` and `DataFrame` types should also be reviewed for correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function _unstack_multiple

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == [] and isinstance(data, Series):
        # Everything is in clocs, and input is a Series
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + [obs_ids]
        new_names = cnames + ["__placeholder__"]
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids] + clevels
        new_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"] + cnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=recons_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code ensures that the unstacking operation is performed accurately, considering the input parameters and the type of input data (Series or DataFrame). It also correctly identifies the levels and codes for the new columns based on the input parameters and the data index.
