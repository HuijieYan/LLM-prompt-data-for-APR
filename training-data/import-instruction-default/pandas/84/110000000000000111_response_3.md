1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError", which is in relation to the `unstack` method failing with a KeyError when a MultiIndex with tuple names is attempted to be unstacked.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function lies in the following lines:
   - `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`
   - `if rlocs == []:`

3. The bug is caused due to the function's inability to handle hierarchical columns properly. As evident from the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names. The problematic function does not handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly, which leads to a KeyError when the `unstack` method is called.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Updating the function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.
   - Ensuring all the levels of the MultiIndex are properly accounted for during unstacking.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function, which resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(ccodes, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(ccodes, shape=None, xnull=False)
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames

        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays([unstacked.index, new_levels])
            unstacked.index = new_columns
        else:
            new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays([unstacked.columns, new_levels])
            unstacked.columns = new_columns
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        unstacked = result

    return unstacked
```
This corrected function should handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
