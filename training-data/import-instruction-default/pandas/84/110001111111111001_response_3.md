The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be due to the incorrect handling of the index name tuple. It's trying to find the level number for the entire tuple as a single level, which is causing errors. Instead, it should handle each component of the tuple individually.

The error message "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" and "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" indicates that it's encountering an issue with the tuple ('A', 'a') as a level, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to properly handle the multi-level index by iterating over each level in the clocs tuple and getting the level number for each individual level.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    if len(cloc_levels) == 1 and isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        cloc_levels = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs[0]]

    rloc_levels = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_levels]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rloc_levels]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rloc_levels]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rloc_levels]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code should properly handle both single-level and multi-level indices and should pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
