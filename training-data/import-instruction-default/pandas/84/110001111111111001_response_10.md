The `clocs` variable seems to be specified as a tuple in the failing test, but the `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas` library appears to expect the input as a string, not a tuple. This is most likely causing the error in the `_get_level_number` function.

To fix this, the input `clocs` should be converted from a tuple to a string when calling the `_get_level_number` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = ['_'.join(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # remaining code here...

    return unstacked
```

This fix modifies the `clocs` variable before using it, converting each element from a tuple to a string using the `join` method. This will ensure that the `_get_level_number` function receives the correct input format.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues identified during the analysis.
