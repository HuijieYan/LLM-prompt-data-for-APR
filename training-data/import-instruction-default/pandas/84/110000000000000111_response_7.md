Looking at the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem occurs when unstacking a pivot table with a multi-index containing tuple names. The issue is caused by a KeyError when trying to get the level number for the provided level.

The potential error location within the provided function is likely the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, which is attempting to retrieve the level numbers for the specified columns.

The bug's cause is due to the `index._get_level_number(i)` not being able to handle tuple names as column levels, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle tuple names as column levels and retrieve their level numbers accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs contains tuple names and convert them into tuples
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        clocs = [tuple(c) for c in clocs]

    # Use get_loc to handle multiple index levels and tuples as names
    level_numbers = [index.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

With this fix, the function should now be able to handle multi-indexes with tuple names when unstacking, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. Remember to replace the original buggy function with this corrected version.
