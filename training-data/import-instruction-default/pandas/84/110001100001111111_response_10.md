The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring due to an issue with how the `clocs` parameter is being used to retrieve the level number. The input "clocs" is a tuple in the form `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, but the function is attempting to directly use the values of tuples as keys for the index names, which is causing a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `clocs` parameter is used to retrieve the level number from the index. We should iterate through the elements of the tuple and retrieve the level numbers individually.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `get_level_number` method to retrieve the level numbers for each element of the `clocs` tuple. The rest of the function remains unchanged and is expected to work correctly based on the expected input/output variable information provided.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where a KeyError was raised due to using the tuple values directly as keys in the index. With the fix, the function is expected to work as intended and no longer throw an error.
