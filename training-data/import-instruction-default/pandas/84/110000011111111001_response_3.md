The problematic function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the test to fail due to an error related to the MultiIndex `names`. The method `_get_level_number` is not able to handle the MultiIndex names when specified as a tuple of tuples. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access the level by its name, which is causing a `ValueError` and `KeyError`.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex names properly. The function should be able to extract the level numbers for each specified level, whether they are single strings or tuples of strings.

Potential Fix:
1. Check if the input `clocs` is a tuple of tuples. If so, extract the level numbers for each tuple in the input.
2. For each level specified in `clocs`, check if it exists in the MultiIndex names. If it does, add its level number to the `clocs` list.
3. Use these level numbers to perform the unstack operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fixed version of the function should handle both single level names and tuple of level names correctly, thereby resolving the issues with the failing test.

Please note that if this issue occurs due to a specific version of pandas, it might be necessary to check the version compatibility and determine if an upgrade or downgrade is needed.
