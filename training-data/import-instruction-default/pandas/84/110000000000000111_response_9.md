The issue is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function which fails to deal with hierarchical columns when unstacking. This results in a KeyError when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The specific error in the function occurs when attempting to get the level number of a MultiIndex level. It does not handle tuple names properly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to get the level number.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to properly handle hierarchical columns, specifically MultiIndex with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(list(rlocs), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function properly handles unstacking for MultiIndex with tuple names and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
