The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a MultiIndexed object, but when unstacking with tuple names, it fails with a KeyError. This is likely due to a problem with how the function is handling MultiIndex objects and tuple names.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue may lie in how the function is handling the index and extracting level numbers. The function may not be correctly handling MultiIndex objects with tuples as names.

In the provided GitHub issue, there is a clear traceback showing that the `_get_level_number` function is raising a KeyError, indicating that the level "A" is not found. This is likely due to how the function is handling tuple names in MultiIndex objects.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be updated to properly handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names when unstacking. This may involve modifying the way the function accesses level numbers and deals with tuple names within the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` that resolves the issue is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function should now be able to correctly handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names when unstacking, resolving the issue. This fixed version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
