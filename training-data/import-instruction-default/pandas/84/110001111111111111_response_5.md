The issue in the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is likely due to the incorrect handling of multi-level index names when unstacking. 

By analyzing the failing tests and error messages, it appears that the `_get_level_number` method of the multi-index is encountering an issue when trying to retrieve the level number for a tuple name. This results in a KeyError being raised. 

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to properly handle multi-level index names and retrieve the level number based on the input parameter.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle multi-level index names by retrieving the level number based on the input parameter.
2. Ensure that the function returns the expected unstacked DataFrame for multi-level index names.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Correctly handle multi-level index names

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
