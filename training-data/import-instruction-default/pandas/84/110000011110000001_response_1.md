The issue seems to be with the way the function `_get_level_number` in the MultiIndex class is being used to get the level number but it is throwing ValueError with the message "The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number". This might be due to the fact that the parameter `level` provided to `_get_level_number` is incorrect or not in the expected format.

One approach to fix the bug is to check the type of `level` before calling `_get_level_number` and modify the parameter if necessary. Another approach is to handle the multi-index in a different way to avoid this error.

Here's the revised and corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the fixed version, we added a conditional to check if the element in `clocs` is a tuple. If it is a tuple, it means it is a multi-index level, so we call `_get_level_number` on it. If not, it is a regular level, so we keep it as is. This approach should handle the issue with getting the level number from the multi-index correctly while also handling regular index levels.
