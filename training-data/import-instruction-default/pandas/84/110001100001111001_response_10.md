The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by incorrect manipulation of the index and columns of the DataFrame. The logic for creating a new index and columns is flawed, leading to the incorrect unstacking of the data.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to correct the logic for creating the new index and columns, as well as the unstacking process. The correct approach would be to use the existing `unstack` function provided by pandas, and modify the index and columns accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should properly handle the unstacking process and create the new index and columns as expected.

Please note that the exact implementation of the unstacking logic might be specific to the input data and the desired output format, so further testing and adjustments may be necessary based on the specific requirements.
