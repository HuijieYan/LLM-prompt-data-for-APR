Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue is occurring in the _get_level_number function of the MultiIndex class. The error message "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" followed by "KeyError: 'Level A not found'" suggests that the level name 'A' is not being recognized within the MultiIndex.

The failing test "test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex" indicates that unstacking with tuple names in a MultiIndex is failing, which matches the issue reported in the GitHub issue.

As the error occurs within the _get_level_number function, it is likely that the issue is related to how the level names are being handled or recognized within the function. It appears that the function is not able to correctly identify the level names provided in the test, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix this issue, the _get_level_number function needs to correctly handle the recognition of tuple names within the MultiIndex.

Based on the understanding of the issue and analysis, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle the recognition of tuple names within the MultiIndex when getting the level number. By using isinstance(i, tuple), we can handle tuple names in the _get_level_number function. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
