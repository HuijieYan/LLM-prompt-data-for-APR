Based on the analysis, it appears that the issue is occurring due to the input parameter value being passed to the `_get_level_number` function of the MultiIndex. The input parameter `('A', 'a')` is being treated as a single tuple instead of two separate levels, causing the `ValueError` and `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, the input parameter should be handled as a tuple of multiple levels. The input parameter should be split into individual levels and then passed to the `_get_level_number` function.

The corrected function for `_unstack_multiple` is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # processing clocs to handle tuple of levels
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

Once the bug is fixed, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected function ensures that the input parameter is handled correctly and the levels are extracted from the tuple before passing them to the `_get_level_number` function. This should resolve the `ValueError` and the `KeyError` raised during the unstack operation.
