The issue reported on GitHub involves running the `unstack` method on a Series with MultiIndex and tuple names, resulting in a KeyError. The error occurs when the program tries to retrieve the level number for the given level name. This indicates that the function `_get_level_number`, which is part of the `_unstack_multiple` function, in the pandas library is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly.

Possible approaches to fixing this bug could involve checking if the given level name is a tuple, and if it is, handling it differently than a regular level name. Additionally, handling the hierarchical columns correctly in the `unstack` method should resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Handling tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

With these modifications, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
