The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that `'A' is not found` in the list, which is causing a `KeyError`.

The issue is causing this error because the function `_get_level_number` tries to find the index of the level, but the way the code is structured, it's causing an error due to multi-level index.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way clocs are handled when dealing with MultiIndex. We need to handle normal Index and MultiIndex differently.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function which should fix the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [(i[0],) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The fix involves handling `clocs` differently based on whether the index is a MultiIndex or not. We check for MultiIndex and then apply the necessary transformation before using the `_get_level_number` method.

With this fix, the function should now handle both MultiIndex and normal Index correctly and pass the failing test.
