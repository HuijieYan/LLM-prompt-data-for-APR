The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is essentially used to unstack a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The error occurs at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` within the function, where it tries to retrieve the level number for each item in `clocs` and store it in `clocs`. The error message indicates that the name 'A' is not found in the list, leading to a `KeyError` and a subsequent `ValueError`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `clocs` list contains tuples of levels in the MultiIndex, and the function incorrectly tries to find the level numbers for those tuples. This leads to the 'A' not found error.

To fix this bug, we should iterate over the `clocs` list and convert each tuple of levels into a single level name before obtaining its level number.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index.names.index(i)] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index.names.index(i)] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[index.names.index(i)] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in ccodes]

    # rest of the function remains as it is
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By making these changes, the function correctly retrieves the levels, codes, and names based on the provided `clocs`, and it should now pass the failing test.
