The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it attempts to unstack a MultiIndex using a tuple of names as the level, which causes a KeyError because it's incorrectly trying to retrieve the level number using the tuple. The function should correctly handle the MultiIndex and unstack it while extracting the relevant level numbers and names.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the MultiIndex and extract the level numbers and names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # extract the level numbers and names from the index
    index = data.index
    level_numbers = [index.names.index(name) for name in clocs]
    level_names = [name if isinstance(name, str) else name[1] for name in clocs]

    # unstack the data using the extracted level numbers and names
    unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    # set the new level names for the unstacked data
    unstacked.columns.set_names(level_names, inplace=True)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now correctly handle the unstacking of MultiIndex using tuples of names as levels.

With this corrected function, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved and the function should work as expected.

Please note that the `_unstack_multiple` function should be thoroughly tested with different input scenarios to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
