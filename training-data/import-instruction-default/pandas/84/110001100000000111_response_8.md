Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue is likely in the implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the handling of MultiIndexes when unstacking.

Bug's cause:
The issue seems to occur when the `unstack` method is called on the `s` Series. This results in the `_unstack_multiple` function being called, which contains a faulty implementation for unstacking MultiIndexes. The error arises from the improper handling of the levels and names within the MultiIndex columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of MultiIndexes when unstacking.
2. Verify the correct extraction of levels, codes, and names for the MultiIndex columns.
3. Check the implementation for unstacking MultiIndexes and ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]  # Update to handle MultiIndex with tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # The remaining implementation of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The above corrected code ensures that MultiIndexes with tuple names are handled appropriately by parsing the index levels and names to extract the correct level numbers for further processing. This modification aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unstacking MultiIndexed Series.
