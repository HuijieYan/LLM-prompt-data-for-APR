The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing the issue in the `pandas` library. The error occurs when the function tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` for an input that consists of tuple names for a MultiIndex (`('A', 'a')` in this case). The `_get_level_number` function then tries to find the level in the list of names and throws a KeyError because it does not find the tuple name 'A'.

To fix this issue, the function should properly handle the case when the input is tuple names for a MultiIndex. It should retrieve the level number using the names of the MultiIndex without trying to directly index it. Additionally, the function should also handle the case where the input consists of different types of names in a MultiIndex.

Based on the provided bug description and error message, the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        current_loc = []
        for key in loc:
            try:
                current_loc.append(index._get_level_number(key))
            except KeyError:
                raise ValueError(f"The name {key} is not in the MultiIndex")
        level_numbers.append(tuple(current_loc))

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...rest of the function...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code will handle the case where the input `clocs` is a tuple of names for the MultiIndex, and it retrieves the level numbers based on these names. It also raises a ValueError with a descriptive message if a name is not found in the MultiIndex.

These changes should resolve the issue reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
