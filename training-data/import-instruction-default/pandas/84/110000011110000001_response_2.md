The issue arises due to the `_get_level_number` method being called on a MultiIndex object with tuple names. The function expects the level parameter to be a single string, not a tuple, which leads to the error.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names in a better way. We should extract the level names from the tuples and then perform the necessary operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    levels = []
    codes = []

    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, str):
            level = index._get_level_number(loc)
            levels.append(index.levels[level])
            codes.append(index.codes[level])
        elif isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level = []
            code = []
            for l in loc:
                level.append(index._get_level_number(l))
            for c in level:
                level.append(index.levels[c])
                code.append(index.codes[c])
            levels.append(level)
            codes.append(code)

    shape = [len(x) for x in levels]
    group_index = get_group_index(codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
}
```

This fixed version handles both single string levels and tuple levels. It extracts the level information based on the type (string or tuple) and then proceeds with the unstacking operation.

This updated function should resolve the issues mentioned in the failing test and error messages.
