The problem is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method, which takes a level and tries to find its index in the `names` attribute. The error indicates that the level 'A' is not found in the list.

This error is happening in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
It indicates that the `clocs` list contains a value 'A', which is not being recognized as a valid level for the index object.

A potential approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the `clocs` list only contains valid levels of the index. This might involve validating the input levels and making sure that they exist in the index before using them.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    for loc in clocs:
        if loc not in index.names:
            raise ValueError(f"Level {loc} not found in index")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we are iterating over the `clocs` list and checking if each level exists in the index's names. If not, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.

This fix ensures that only valid levels are used in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
