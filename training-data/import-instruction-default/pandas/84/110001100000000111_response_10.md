The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the following line:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This line is attempting to get the level number for each item in `clocs`, but it is not handling the case where the column names are tuples (MultiIndex).

The bug is caused because the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle MultiIndex columns, and it causes a KeyError when it tries to get the level number for a tuple (e.g. ('A', 'a')).

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex column names by checking if the column names are tuples and handling them appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # (including the code that handles MultiIndex and Series cases)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code adds a condition to check if the index is a MultiIndex, and if it is, it uses the index names to determine the level number instead of directly calling `_get_level_number`. This handles the case where the column names are tuples and resolves the KeyError issue.
