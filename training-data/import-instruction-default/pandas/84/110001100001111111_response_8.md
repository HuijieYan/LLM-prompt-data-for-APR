The potential error in the `buggy` function seems to be in the manipulation of `clocs` and `rlocs`. According to the GitHub issue and the provided expected output, these should be tuples of tuples that define the MultiIndex levels that will be unstacked. However, in the code, they are being used as lists of indices, which doesn't match the expected usage.

To fix this, the function should first handle the case when there is a tuple input in `clocs` and then extract the individual levels from the tuple. Then, we can unstack the DataFrame based on these levels.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        levels = []
        for loc in clocs:
            levels.extend(loc)
    else:
        levels = clocs

    unstacked = data.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked
```
