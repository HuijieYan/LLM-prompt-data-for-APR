The bug is caused by using a tuple of tuples, instead of individual strings, as the "level" argument when calling the `unstack` method. This causes the `_get_level_number` method to raise a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `unstack` method should be called with individual strings instead of a tuple of tuples. Additionally, the function should handle the case of `clocs` being a tuple of tuples or individual strings to avoid errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    elif isinstance(clocs, str):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function handles the case where `clocs` can be a tuple of tuples or a tuple of strings. It then converts the tuples into strings and calls the `_get_level_number` method with the individual strings, avoiding the KeyError.

The above code should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
