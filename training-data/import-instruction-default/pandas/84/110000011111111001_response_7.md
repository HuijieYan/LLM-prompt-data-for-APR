Based on the error message and the failing test, the issue seems to be with the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class which is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that it is unable to find the level 'A' in the MultiIndex, which causes a KeyError.

The likely cause of this issue is that the input parameter "clocs" is being passed as a tuple of values, which is incompatible with the `_get_level_number` method. This is leading to the ValueError and KeyError in the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the input parameters correctly. The function should be able to handle a tuple of values for "clocs" and retrieve the level numbers accordingly.

One possible approach to fix this issue is to modify the logic of the `_unstack_multiple` function to iterate through the values in the "clocs" tuple and retrieve the level numbers for each value using the `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else index._get_level_number((c,)) for c in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This modified logic should handle both single level values and tuples of values for "clocs" and ensure that the level numbers are retrieved correctly to avoid the ValueError and KeyError.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
