Upon analysis, the issue seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. The method is supposed to return the level number of a given level name, but it's failing and raising a KeyError in the process.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be originating from how the `clocs` variable is being processed. The `clocs` variable is a tuple of level names, but the function process it assuming that it can also be a single value, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the `clocs` variable, ensuring it is always processed as a tuple of level names.

Additionally, error handling should be implemented to catch any potential errors that might occur during processing of the level names to prevent the raise of incorrect exceptions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, str):
        clocs = (clocs,)  # Ensure clocs is always a tuple

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function will address the bug by ensuring that the `clocs` variable is processed as a tuple and updating the code to correctly handle this variable. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and behave as expected.
