Potential error location: The potential error location is in redefining the clocs variable inside the loop for MultiIndex. 
In the `else` block of the function, there is a reassignment of the variable `clocs` in the for loop. This reassignment can lead to unexpected behavior in the subsequent iteration and may cause the incorrect output.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by redefining the variable `clocs` inside the for loop, and then using it to index the `result` DataFrame. This can lead to incorrect unstacking of the DataFrame.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid redefining the `clocs` variable inside the for loop in the `else` block. Use a different variable for iteration if necessary.
2. Refactor the code to ensure that the variables are not being overwritten inadvertently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_copy = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By using a separate copy of the `clocs` variable for iteration within the loop, we can ensure that the original variable is not inadvertently modified, and this should fix the bug.
