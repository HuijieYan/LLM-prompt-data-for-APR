Upon analyzing the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, it seems that the main issue lies in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The error message indicates that the name 'A' is not found in the list of names, and this occurs because the `clocs` in this case is a tuple `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, which is not being handled correctly by the function.

In the failing test functions, it's evident that the function should be able to handle both cases where `clocs` is either a tuple or a single element. It should also correctly determine the level number and process the levels accordingly.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle different types of input for `clocs` and determine the level numbers of each correctly.

A potential approach to fix this bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function so that it handles multiple levels correctly, both when the input is a tuple of names and when it's a single name. It should also correctly determine the level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [clocs]

    for i, loc in enumerate(clocs):
        if isinstance(loc, str):
            level = index._get_level_number(loc)
            clocs[i] = level

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code should handle both cases where `clocs` is a tuple or a single name, and determine the level numbers correctly. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.
