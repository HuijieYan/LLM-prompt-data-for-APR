Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class. This method is used to get the level number, but it is raising a KeyError due to the input level not being found in the list of names. This is resulting in the unstack operation failing.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the method `_get_level_number` in the MultiIndex class not handling the input correctly, leading to a KeyError. This is triggered when unstacking a MultiIndexed Series or DataFrame with tuple names.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle tuple names correctly and return the appropriate level number without raising a KeyError.
2. Update the unstacking logic to ensure proper handling of tuple names in a MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

The change in the code involves checking if the input level is a tuple and using `_get_level_number` to get the appropriate level number for tuple names. The rest of the logic remains intact.

With this correction, the unstacking operation should properly handle tuple names in a MultiIndex and pass the failing test. This fix should also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
