Based on the error message and the provided source code, the bug is likely located in the function `_get_level_number` within the MultiIndex class. This function is used in the `_unstack_multiple` function to get the level number for each level in the column index.

The error message indicates that the function is not able to find the specified level, 'A'. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the level is being extracted within the `_get_level_number` function.

Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the function is not handling the case where tuple names are used in the `unstack` method with MultiIndex. This is leading to the KeyError and ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be modified to handle the case of tuple names. Additionally, the `_unstack_multiple` function also needs to be updated to properly handle the unstacking of a MultiIndex with tuple names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains as is)

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs[0])
    else:
        clocs = [clocs[0]]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # ... (other code for unstacking Series remains as is)
    else:
        # ... (other code for unstacking DataFrame remains as is)

    return unstacked
```

And here's the corrected code for the `_get_level_number` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        # Handling tuple names
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if count == 0:
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} does not exist in the MultiIndex")
        else:
            return [i for i, name in enumerate(self.names) if name == level][0]
    else:
        # Handling single-level name
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if count > 1 and not is_integer(level):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            if not is_integer(level):
                raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
            elif level < 0:
                level += self.nlevels
        return level
```

These corrections will handle the case of tuple names in the unstacking process for MultiIndex, and the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
