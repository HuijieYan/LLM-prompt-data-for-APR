The issue is likely to be in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error message "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'" indicates that the function is trying to cast an array from float64 to int64, which is not allowed according to the 'safe' casting rule.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is trying to cast a floating-point array into an integer array, which is not possible when the rule for casting is set to 'safe'. This is likely happening when the function is dealing with the data and attempting to convert it into a specific data type.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to handle the casting of arrays more explicitly, ensuring that the correct data types are used for the calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # Existing code
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if numeric_only:
                # safely cast the result to the appropriate dtype
                try:
                    result = result.astype(np.float64, copy=False)
                except TypeError as err:
                    raise TypeError(f"Cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to float64") from err

            # Existing code

    # existing code

# This corrected function separates handling the numeric casting more explicitly when dealing with the result data and ensures that the appropriate data type is used for calculations.
```

This corrected version separates handling the numeric casting more explicitly when dealing with the result data and ensures that the appropriate data type is used for calculations.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and address the issue described in the error messages.
