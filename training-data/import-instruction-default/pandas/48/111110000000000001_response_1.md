The potential error in the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely related to the handling of split objects, which could lead to incorrect aggregation.

The bug is caused by an issue related to splitting items and frames and their subsequent handling. This could result in incorrect aggregation and output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the splitting and subsequent handling of split items and frames is performed correctly to avoid errors in aggregation.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            # the buggy part has been corrected
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Before using the corrected version, ensure that the changes will not have any negative impact on the dependent parts of the code. Test thoroughly after incorporating the provided fix.
