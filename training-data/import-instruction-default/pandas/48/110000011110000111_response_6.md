The issue stems from attempting to cast a float64 numpy array to an int64 array in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The specific error that is raised is a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`. This error occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object when the DataFrame being grouped contains the `Int64` type.

The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function in `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py` correctly handles the downcasting of a float64 numpy array to an int64 array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if result is not no_result:
        # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
            # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
            #  and result is ndarray[object]
            assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
            try:
                # Cast back if feasible
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                )
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                # Do not cast if not feasible
                pass

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

    new_items.append(locs)
    agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

# ... (remaining functions remains unchanged)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the result is possibly downcast to the original dtype using the `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` function, and the casting back to the original dtype takes place without raising any TypeErrors.

This fix should resolve the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue associated with calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
