From the error messages, it seems that the issue is related to safely casting non-equivalent float64 to int64. This indicates that there might be a problem with casting float64 to int64 in the _cython_agg_blocks function.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled correctly, especially when dealing with nullable integers.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should fix the bug:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_downcast_numeric
from pandas.core.internals import Block

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        agg_block = maybe_downcast_numeric(agg_block, block.dtype)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items

```

The changes made to the function include addressing the casting issue by using the maybe_downcast_numeric function to ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled correctly.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the casting issues and allow it to pass the failing test.
