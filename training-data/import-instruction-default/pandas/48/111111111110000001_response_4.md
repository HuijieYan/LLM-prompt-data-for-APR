## Problem Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to cast a NumPy array with dtype `float64` to `int64` using the `astype` method, which is causing a `TypeError` to be raised. The failing test that triggers this error is checking operations like mean, median, and variance on nullable integer data.

Upon analyzing the error message, it is evident that the issue is related to casting float to int. The failing test is based on nullable integer data and the function `safe_cast` in the error message tries to safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the integers.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect casting of float dtype to int dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the casting logic to properly handle the conversion from float to int without raising exceptions.
2. Adjust the data types or the casting logic to ensure that the dtype conversion is performed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle dtype conversion from float to int more gracefully.

## The corrected code for the problematic function

```python
# The corrected code fixes the bug by properly handling dtype conversion from float to int
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing function body

    for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        # Existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # Code for casting float to integer by choosing a method based on dtype
            if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.integer):
                result = result.round().astype(block.dtype)

            str_dtype = str(result.dtype)
            if 'float' in str_dtype.lower() and 'int' in block.dtype:
                if min(result) == max(result) and min(block) == max(block):
                    result = result.astype(block.dtype)
                else:
                    raise DataError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(block.dtype)}")

            # Existing code

    # Existing function body
```

With this fix, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` will correctly handle the dtype conversion from float to int and should resolve the TypeError issue observed in the failing test.
