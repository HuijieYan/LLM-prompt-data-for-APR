The issue is likely caused by the use of the nullable integer data type (Int64) when performing aggregation operations within a DataFrameGroupBy. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be encountering a TypeError when attempting to perform these operations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the behavior of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._consolidate(convert=False)

    result = data._reduce(how, as_frame=True, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count)

    if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
        agg_blocks = result._data.blocks
        agg_items = result.columns
    else:
        agg_blocks = [result]
        agg_items = Index(["result"])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code adjusts the data handling and aggregation operations to appropriately handle the nullable integer data type, resolving the TypeError issue encountered when performing aggregation operations in a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer values.

This should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue as well as the potential TypeError that can occur when performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer data type.

Please note that the code assumes that the `_get_data_to_aggregate` function and other related functions work as intended.
