The bug is likely caused by the conversion of nullable integer values to float values during the aggregation process, resulting in a TypeError. The issue is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

To resolve the issue, we need to handle the conversion of nullable integer values to float values properly during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[data.items.get_indexer(blk.mgr_locs)]
        agg_blocks[i] = blk

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The changes made to the function involve using the `convert` method to handle nullable integer values properly and ensuring that the locs in the blocks are updated to correspond to the current ordering.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should resolve the TypeError issue and pass the failing test.

This corrected function addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.

If you replace the existing `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the corrected version, it should pass the failing test and resolve the TypeError issue.
