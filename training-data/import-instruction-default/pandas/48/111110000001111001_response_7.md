The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` from the `DataFrameGroupBy` class mistakenly includes a condition that should have raised a `NotImplementedError`, but instead falls back to a different condition. This incorrect behavior leads to an incorrect result.

The potential error location is the `try-except` block that catches `NotImplementedError`. The code in the `except` block should not be executed in all cases, but it is currently being run when it shouldn't be.

The bug is caused by the mishandling of the `NotImplementedError` condition, leading to the incorrect execution of an alternative block of code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `try-except` block to correctly raise the `NotImplementedError` when needed. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct condition is being evaluated to avoid falling into the alternative block.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise  # Re-raise the NotImplementedError
        else:
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
            # (Code to handle non-NotImplementedError conditions)
            # ...

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By correcting the logic inside the `try-except` block to raise the `NotImplementedError` when needed, we ensure that the handling of exceptions is aligned with the intended behavior, and the function should now work as expected.
