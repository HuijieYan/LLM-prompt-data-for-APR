The potential error in the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is primarily caused by the handling of split blocks. The function attempts to recombine split blocks, but it does not handle this process correctly, leading to an error.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling split blocks and ensure that the recombination process is handled properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/groupby/generic.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This is the corrected function
