The issue is likely caused due to the new nullable integer data type, which results in a TypeError when calling mean after grouping. The issue seems to be related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Also, the failing test functions are attempting to call the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on grouped nullable integer data, which is triggering the TypeError with the safe cast of dtype float64 to int64.

To fix the issue, it is recommended to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the casting of nullable integer data types appropriately. The safe cast function should be updated to handle the safe casting of nullable integer data types to float64 for mean, median, and var operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
# Assuming the entire class structure here for context
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    # Existing functions

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Existing logic

            if result.dtype.type == np.float64 and block.dtype.name == "Int64":
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            # Existing logic

        # Existing logic
```

The suggested correction ensures that when the result of aggregation is of dtype float64 and the original block's dtype is "Int64", it converts the result to float64 using the `maybe_convert_objects` function.

This correction should handle the safe casting of nullable integer data types to float64 for mean, median, and var operations, resolving the TypeError. The corrected function should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test.
