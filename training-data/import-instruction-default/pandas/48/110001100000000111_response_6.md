3. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the line:
```python
result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
```
It seems to be causing a TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a) Checking if any changes were made to the behavior of the `.aggregate()` method over time.
   (b) Reviewing the logic used within the `for` loop, confirming that it is handling the necessary data types appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Check if block.dtype is numeric to avoid the TypeError issue
            if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(block.dtype):
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handling NotImplementedError
            # Move to alternative method if provided (alt)
            # ...

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
By checking if the `block.dtype` is numeric before calling the `self.grouper.aggregate()` method, we can avoid the TypeError issue described in the GitHub issue.
