The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of splits in object-dtype blocks, leading to incorrect aggregation or errors. This is evident from the code where it attempts to handle split blocks (`split_items` and `split_frames` lists), and then later attempts to clean up this mess. It is possible that this cleanup process does not work as intended, leading to incorrect aggregation results or errors.

To fix this bug, we can revise the logic for handling split object-dtype blocks and make the cleanup process more robust. This may involve restructuring the code to handle split blocks more effectively and ensure that the cleanup process correctly combines the split frames and items.

The corrected code for the `DataFrameGroupBy` class containing the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, along with the related functions, is provided below:

```python
# The corrected code for the DataFrameGroupBy class and related functions
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle NotImplementedError 
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    continue
    
                # call our grouper again with only this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
    
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
    
            assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)
    
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                            result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                        )
                    except ValueError:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)
    
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessary handling of split items and frames, focusing only on the aggregation process for the blocks. By simplifying the logic and focusing on the core aggregation functionality, the code aims to eliminate potential sources of errors related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks.
