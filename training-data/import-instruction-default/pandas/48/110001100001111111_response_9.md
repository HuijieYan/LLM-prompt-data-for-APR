The bug is likely caused by an issue with the `aggregate` function called within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The code operates on the assumption that the passed `DataFrame` has only numeric data, leading to issues when non-numeric columns are present. Additionally, there is an issue with the type conversion of the result. 

To fix the bug, the `DataFrame` should be filtered to include only numeric columns before performing the aggregation. Additionally, the type conversion of the result should be handled more carefully to avoid the `TypeError` that arises when operating with nullable integer data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.to_numpy()

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, np.float64)

            new_block = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=np.float64)
            agg_block = block.make_block(new_block)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # remaining code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code filters the DataFrame to include only numeric columns, converts the result to float64 type, and handles the nullable integer data type more carefully. This should resolve the issues described in the GitHub issue.
