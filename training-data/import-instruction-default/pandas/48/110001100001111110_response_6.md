In the corrected function, I have replaced the original logic with a call to `grouper.aggregate_blocks` to avoid the TypeError that occurs when the mean, median, and std functions encounter non-numeric data in the DataFrame. This change ensures that mean, median, var, and other numeric aggregation functions work correctly with nullable integer data types in a DataFrameGroupBy object. Additionally, I handled possible DataError, TypeError, and SpecificationError exceptions, and raised them back up to the calling code for additional error handling.
