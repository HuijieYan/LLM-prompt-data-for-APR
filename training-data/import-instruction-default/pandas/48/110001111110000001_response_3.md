The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to convert float64 to int64, which is causing the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`.

The cause of the error is the incorrect type conversion from float64 to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

To fix this bug, the problematic type conversion needs to be resolved by handling the float64 values appropriately without casting them to int64.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This modified code should handle the float64 values appropriately to resolve the type casting error. Once this corrected code is used as a replacement for the buggy function, it should pass the failing test.
