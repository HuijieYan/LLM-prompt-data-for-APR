Upon analyzing the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` and its relationship with the related class and functions, along with the failing test and error message, it appears that the bug may be caused by the improper data type casting when handling nullable integers (pd.NA) while performing aggregation operations.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to handle the conversion of nullable integer values appropriately, ensuring that the conversion to the specified data type is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    # ...

    # New code to handle safe conversion to int
    if not numeric_only:
        # Check for nullable integers and convert to float if needed
        for block in data.blocks:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(block.values):
                block.values = block.values.astype(float)
    
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the aforementioned code to handle the safe conversion of nullable integer values to float, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should now pass the failing test and correctly handle nullable integer values during aggregation operations.
