The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the pandas `GroupBy` class, and its purpose is to aggregate the data using cython. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that using the new nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64') with the `groupby` function and then calling `mean` results in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block where the function tries to downcast the result using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function.

The bug is caused by the interaction of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the implementation of the new nullable integer data type. It seems that when the grouping key has a nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64'), the function is unable to handle the aggregation properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately. One approach could be to check for the data type of the columns being aggregated and handle nullable integer data types differently from other data types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        agg_result = None
        try:
            agg_result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            if isinstance(agg_result, np.ndarray):
                if agg_result.dtype.kind == 'i' and block.values.dtype.kind == 'O':
                    # Handle nullable integer data type
                    result = block.dtype.type(agg_result)
                else:
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(agg_result, convert_list_like=True)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle NotImplementedError
            # omitted for brevity
        except DataError:
            # handle DataError
            # omitted for brevity
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            
    # rest of the code omitted for brevity

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected code includes handling for nullable integer data types when aggregating the data. This should resolve the TypeError issue reported on GitHub.
