The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has errors related to converting values in certain blocks from `float64` to `int64` when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` methods on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.

The issue is that when calculating the aggregate statistics, the function is attempting to cast `float64` values to `int64`. This is due to the fact that the original datatype is of type 'Int64' which supports Nullable integers. Since `int64` and `float64` are incompatible types, it results in a TypeError.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) differently. Specifically, the function should check the original datatype of the values being aggregated and handle nullable integers appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code remains the same)

        if result is None:
            continue

        if isinstance(result, (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)):
            # For GroupBy.mean(), it's safe to assume a float dtype
            # and avoid unnecessary casting.
            if function in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
                result = result.astype(np.float64)
            else:
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)

        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame) and len(result.columns) > 1:
            # ... (other code remains the same)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated function includes additional checks for `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods to handle nullable integer dtype appropriately, converting the result to `float64` as needed. This should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean, median, or var methods on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.

These changes should resolve the bug and make the function compatible with the failing test and the issue posted in GitHub.
