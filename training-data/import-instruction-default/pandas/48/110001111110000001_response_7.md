The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 using the `astype` method. This error is likely due to an incorrect data type conversion during the aggregation process.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be aggregating data based on some grouping criteria. It seems to be trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion is handled correctly during the aggregation process. This may involve checking the data types of the input values and performing appropriate conversions as needed.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the data type conversion logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle non-equivalent float64 values to int64 correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing function body

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing logic here

        if result is not no_result:
            # Existing logic here
            # To fix the type casting issue, we can add a condition to handle non-equivalent float64 values
            if block.dtype == np.float64 and result.dtype == np.int64:
                result = result.astype(float)  # Convert the result to float type if needed

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Existing logic here
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function includes a condition to handle non-equivalent float64 values to int64 during the aggregation process, ensuring that the data type conversion is handled correctly.

By incorporating this fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now be able to handle the type casting issue and pass the failing test.
