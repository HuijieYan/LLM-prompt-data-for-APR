The bug in the buggy function is likely caused by the TypeError raised when calling mean after grouping a DataFrame with Int64 dtype. This occurs when calling `df.groupby('a').mean()`.

The issue on GitHub also mentions that the error does not occur when calling min, max or first, but does occur with median and std.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the data type is Int64 and calculate the mean correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)  # handling mean specifically for Int64 dtype
        else:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function should handle the Int64 dtype specifically when calculating the mean and should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
