The buggy function is the `_cython_agg_blocks` method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations such as `mean`, `median`, or `var`. The error message indicates that there is a casting issue from `float64` to `int64` when performing aggregation.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method needs to be modified to properly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.apply(maybe_convert_objects, convert_integer=True)
        data = data.apply(maybe_downcast_to_dtype, dtype=np.float64)

    result_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result_block = block.aggregate(how, axis=1)
        result_blocks.append(result_block)

    agg_items = data.items
    return result_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we have modified the handling of the `Int64` dtype by converting the data to float64 before performing aggregation operations. This ensures that the casting issue from `float64` to `int64` is avoided.

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
