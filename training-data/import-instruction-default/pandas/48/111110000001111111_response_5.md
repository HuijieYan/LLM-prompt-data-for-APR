The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with an `Int64` dtype. The problem occurs when calling various aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

The issue appears to be related to the calculation of aggregate values for the group. This bug potentially lies within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation calculation handles nullable integer dtype properly. One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle nullable integer dtype appropriately when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        # Handle nullable integer dtype
        if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            values = block.values.astype('float')
        else:
            values = block.values

        # Perform aggregation based on the values
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # Create a new aggregated block based on the result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code for handling split blocks and returning aggregated blocks and items
```

The above changes include handling of nullable integer dtype specifically when performing the aggregation operation within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

This corrected version of the method should handle the aggregation operations on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with nullable integer dtype without resulting in a TypeError.
