After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the "safe_cast" function being unable to safely cast non-equivalent data types. The error message and the failing test all point to this issue.

The reason for the error seems to be the inability to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, which is causing a TypeError.

To resolve this issue, the safe cast function should be updated to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the TypeError issue and successfully pass the failing test. Therefore, it would address the problem and address the GitHub issue as well.
