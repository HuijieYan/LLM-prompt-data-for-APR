The potential error within the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely to be due to an incorrect handling of the "split_blocks" case. This is evident from the extensive use of `split_items` and `split_frames` lists, and the subsequent processing of the split blocks.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to revise the logic related to handling split blocks and ensure that the correct operations are performed for split blocks. Additionally, any potential issues regarding indexing, deletion, and block management should be carefully reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```
In the corrected version of the function, the processing of split blocks has been revised, and a more explicit approach to handling the `split_items` and `split_frames` lists has been implemented to ensure correctness. Additionally, potential issues related to indexing, deletion, and block management have been reviewed and revised as necessary.
