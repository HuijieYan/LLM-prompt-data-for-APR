1. The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method defined in the class `DataFrameGroupBy` which takes in several parameters and returns a tuple containing a list of blocks and an index. This function is used to combine and aggregate data from different blocks based on a grouping method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where aggregation is being performed using `self.grouper.aggregate()` method. This might be causing an issue when dealing with nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`).

3. The bug's cause is related to the use of nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`) and how aggregation is performed in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. The GitHub issue further explains that calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError when using nullable integer data types. This issue seems to occur due to the `aggregate` method in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling nullable integer data type correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handling nullable integer data type specifically in the aggregation process
   - Addressing the TypeError issue when calling `mean` after grouping with nullable integer data type

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        if str(block.dtype) in ('Int64', 'UInt64'):
            block = maybe_convert_objects(block)

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the exception
            pass
            # rest of the code remains unchanged ...

    # rest of the code remains unchanged ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle nullable integer data types specifically by converting the block to non-nullable integer data type using `maybe_convert_objects()` before performing aggregation. This modification should address the TypeError issue when calling `mean` after grouping with nullable integer data type.
