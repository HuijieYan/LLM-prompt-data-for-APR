The bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) causing a TypeError when the `mean` function is called on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code where the `mean` function is being called, specifically with the nullable integer data type and the subsequent casting of the result to the original dtype.

The cause of the bug stems from the function not handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly when calculating the mean, causing a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking for nullable values and handling them appropriately when calculating the mean.
2. Ensuring that the result of the mean calculation is properly cast to the original dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that aims to address the bug:

```python
# your corrected version of _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if isinstance(block.values, pd.Int64Dtype):
                result = block.values.astype(float).mean()
            else:
                result = block.values.mean()
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle accordingly
            pass

        if result is not no_result:
            if isinstance(block.values, pd.Int64Dtype):
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, dtype=pd.Int64Dtype())
            else:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version aims to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately when calculating the mean, and ensures that the result is properly cast to the original dtype. This should address the TypeError issue when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.

Please note that this fix assumes that the mean calculation is the primary cause of the TypeError and the handling of nullable values is a critical aspect of the bug. If there are other underlying issues, those would need to be addressed as well.
