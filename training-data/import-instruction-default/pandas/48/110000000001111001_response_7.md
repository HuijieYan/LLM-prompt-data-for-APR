The error within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the result from the aggregation operation. The function attempts to cast the block back to the original dtype without considering the possibility of receiving `DataFrame` as a result of the aggregation. This causes issues when trying to reshape or cast the result based on assumptions about its structure.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the result of the aggregation is a `DataFrame` separately from the case where it's an array. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic for updating the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]

            result = self.aggregate_alt(obj, alt, self.axis, mode=how)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            result_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(result_block)
        else:
            # We've received a DataFrame as a result
            split_items.append(locs)
            split_frames.append(result)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the indexer to account for the removed items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    # Adjust the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles both array results and DataFrame results separately, ensuring that the locs are updated and the correct items are aggregated.
