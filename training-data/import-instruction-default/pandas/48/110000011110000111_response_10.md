The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the failing test code and the corresponding error message provided. The function seems to be involved in applying an aggregation function to grouped data.

The error message suggests that there's a problem with safely casting non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

The GitHub issue describes a problem with using the new nullable integer data type in the `groupby` operation, particularly when calling the `mean` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve checking the data type compatibility and ensuring that the correct casting is being applied.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[int] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        agg_items.extend(list(block.items))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version simplifies the aggregation process and avoids potential issues with type casting. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
