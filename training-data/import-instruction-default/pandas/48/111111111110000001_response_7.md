The problem appears to be caused by a data type casting issue, particularly related to the conversion of float values to integer data type. This is being triggered within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when values are being cast using the `astype` method.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the values are correctly handled when casting them from float to integer. This may involve checking for the presence of NaN values and processing them in a manner consistent with the intended behavior.

The corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the data type casting issue is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and block.dtype == np.int64:
                # Convert float values to integer while handling NaN
                if np.isnan(result).any():
                    # Handling NaN values as needed
                    result = result.astype('Int64')
                else:
                    result = result.astype(np.int64)

            # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

This updated version of the function includes additional checks for the data type of the result and the original block, and handles the casting based on the specific conditions. It ensures that the conversion from float to integer takes into account the presence of NaN values and handles them appropriately.

By integrating this fix into the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it should resolve the data type casting issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
