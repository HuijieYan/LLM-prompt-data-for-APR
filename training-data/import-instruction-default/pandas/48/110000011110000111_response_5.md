The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely causing the error when applying the `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer dtype.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting a float64 dtype to an int64 dtype.

The GitHub issue reports that calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError when using the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`), and it provides an example that demonstrates the issue.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to correctly handle the nullable integer dtype in the context of aggregating methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var`. The issue likely lies in the data type handling during the aggregation process. The function should ensure that aggregation operations that involve casting from float to integer are handled appropriately for the `Int64` datatype.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... [Existing code] ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
        try:
            return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        except TypeError as err:
            casted = values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            if (casted == values).all():
                return casted
            raise TypeError(
                f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
            ) from err

    # Update the aggregation process to handle nullable integers
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... [Exception handling and aggregation code] ...

        if result.dtype.name == 'float64' and block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
            result = safe_cast(result, 'int64', copy=False)

        # ... [Remaining code] ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the corrected function, the error when applying `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype should be resolved.

This version of the function should pass the failing test and provide the expected output. It is also expected to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
