The issue in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be related to the data type casting from float to int. The error message indicates that it's not possible to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To fix this bug, the code should handle this data type casting appropriately. It appears that the bug is caused by the assignment of result to cast down float64 to int64. This is not possible in general and is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the float to int casting appropriately, possibly by using a different method or by avoiding the casting altogether.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code

    # modified code to handle the float to int casting appropriately
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if block.dtype != np.float64:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # existing code
            else:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            # existing code

    # existing code
```

By handling the data type casting appropriately, this corrected code should address the bug and pass the failing test.
