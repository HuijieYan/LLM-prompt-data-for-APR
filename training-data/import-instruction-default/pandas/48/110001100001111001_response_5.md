Based on the given information, the buggy function appears to be attempting to handle aggregation by applying a function to the data. However, there seem to be issues with the handling of the result, including unexpected behavior when the result is a DataFrame and reshaping of the result arrays.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to revise the logic for handling the result of the aggregation, especially when dealing with split frames and mixed data types.

Here's the corrected version of the function considering the given input/output variable information:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this revised version, the function loops through the blocks in the data, aggregates the values, and creates new Block objects for the aggregated data. It then constructs the resulting `agg_items` and adjusts the `mgr_locs` for each block in `agg_blocks`.

Please note that depending on the exact behavior of the `grouper.aggregate` method and how it handles the aggregation, you may need to modify this function further to match the desired behavior.
