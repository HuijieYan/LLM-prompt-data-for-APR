1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for handling the aggregation after a `groupby` operation. The GitHub issue describes a problem with calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The issue arises when using the new nullable integer dtype.

2. Potential error location:
The error may be occurring in the code segment where the result of the aggregation is being handled and cast back to the original dtype.

3. Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer dtype in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function appears to be treating nullable integers as regular integers, leading to incompatible casting and resulting in a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
    - Check for the dtype of the input data before performing the aggregation.
    - Use specific handling for nullable integer data types during the aggregation process.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # Handling nullable integer dtype
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle the nullable integer dtype specifically by converting objects and downcasting to the original dtype. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
