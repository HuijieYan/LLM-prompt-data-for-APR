The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to access the 'grouper' attribute. It seems like the 'grouper' attribute is not defined within the function or the class, which is causing the 'self.grouper' attribute to be undefined and leading to errors during the function's execution.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'grouper' attribute is properly defined and initialized within the class or accessible within the scope of the function.

Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    def __init__(self, data, grouper, axis, level, sort, observed, mutated, dropna):
        # Assuming grouper is an attribute that needs to be initialized in the constructor
        self.grouper = grouper
        super().__init__(data, grouper, axis, level, sort, observed, mutated, dropna)

    # rest of the functions remain the same
    # ...

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
```

In the corrected code, I assumed that the 'grouper' attribute needs to be initialized within the class, so I added an `__init__` method to the class and initialized the 'grouper' attribute. This assumes that the 'grouper' should be passed to the constructor when creating an instance of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Please adjust the initialization of the 'grouper' attribute according to your specific requirements.
