The issue is likely caused by the function `_cython_agg_blocks` not handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when calculating the mean, resulting in a TypeError. This is evident from the GitHub issue describing a similar problem with the mean function.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when calculating the mean.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Handle nullable integer data types correctly
    if hasattr(data, "isna"):
        if data.isna().any().any():
            data = data.fillna(0)

    # Rest of the original code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) by filling any missing values with 0 before performing the aggregation.

By making this change, the function should be able to handle nullable integer data types correctly when calculating the mean, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
