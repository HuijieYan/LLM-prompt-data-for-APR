The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has issues with handling the data and calculating aggregated blocks. It seems to be misinterpreting the aggregation results, leading to incorrect output. The use of lists for `new_items`, `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames` is unnecessary and may be causing confusion. There are also inconsistencies in the handling of different data and result types, potentially leading to incorrect computations.

To fix the bug, the following modifications should be made:
1. Remove unnecessary lists for `new_items`, `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames`.
2. Ensure consistent handling of different data and result types.
3. Ensure that the results are correctly aggregated and the correct blocks are assembled for the final output.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[pd.core.internals.blocks.Block], pd.Index]:
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    agg_items = data.items.copy()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
        )
        new_block = pd.core.internals.blocks.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(new_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise pd.core.base.DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = data.items.get_indexer(agg_items)
    agg_items = agg_items.take(indexer)

    for offset, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(block.mgr_locs)
        block.mgr_locs = data.items.take(indexer[offset:offset + loc])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, unnecessary lists have been removed, and the aggregations and assembling of blocks have been streamlined. This should address the issues observed in the buggy function while ensuring that it returns the expected output based on the provided input and variable types.
