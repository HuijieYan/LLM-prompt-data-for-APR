The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to encounter a type error due to failing to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` dtype to `int64`. This error is likely caused by an incorrect type conversion or mismatch in the data types being processed within the function. The failing test code calls the function with different input values and functions (`mean`, `median`, `var`) and checks the output, leading to a failure due to the mentioned type error.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to review the type conversions happening within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and ensure that the data types being used are compatible. Additionally, the function should handle the conversion of non-equivalent data types more gracefully to avoid the type error encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes(infer_objects=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to apply alternate approach
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = GroupBy(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = result._gotitem(0)

            # unwrap DataFrame to get array
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame) and len(result._data.blocks) == 1:
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                result = result.reshape(1, -1) if (isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1) else result

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_datetime=False, convert_timedelta=False)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, placement=None)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

In the corrected version, type conversion and casting operations have been adjusted to handle different data types more gracefully, and an alternate approach has been added to address non-applicable functions. This corrected function should pass the failing test and prevent the type error encountered previously.
