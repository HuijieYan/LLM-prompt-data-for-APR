The root cause of the bug is that the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is encountering a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on the groupby object. This is likely due to the function `_cython_agg_blocks` failing to handle nullable integer data properly. This results in the TypeError when trying to perform the aggregation operation.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be modified to properly handle nullable integer data when performing the aggregation. This can be achieved by updating the function to handle the nullable integer data type and perform the aggregation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated code properly handles nullable integer data when performing the aggregation, and should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This fix aligns with the issue reported on GitHub, as it addresses the problem of calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
