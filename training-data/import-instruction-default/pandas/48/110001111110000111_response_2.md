The bug is likely caused due to an issue with the dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This is indicated by the TypeError raised in the failing tests when trying to cast the values in the `safe_cast` function.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64` is handled correctly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

        if result is not no_result:
            if result.dtype.kind == 'f' and block.dtype.kind == 'i':
                # Convert float64 to Int64 if the original dtype was Int64
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)

            # rest of the code remains unchanged...
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

With this fix, the dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64` will be handled correctly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, and it should resolve the TypeError issue raised in the failing tests.

This corrected code should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
