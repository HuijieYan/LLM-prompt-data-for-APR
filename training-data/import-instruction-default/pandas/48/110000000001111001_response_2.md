The issue with the buggy function is that it tries to aggregate data using a specified function, but if the function is not applicable, it falls back to a default method without properly handling the alternate method. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the alternate method, if provided, and ensure that it is applied correctly when the primary method is not applicable. Additionally, the code should be refactored to ensure consistent handling of the alternate method.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # actual managing of mgr_locs via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate method not provided")

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    # rest of the code unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the alternate method is properly handled and applied when the primary method is not applicable. This ensures that the function handles both scenarios consistently and produces correct results.
