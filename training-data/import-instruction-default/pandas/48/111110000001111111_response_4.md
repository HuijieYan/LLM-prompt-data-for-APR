The bug seems to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, as described in the GitHub issue.

Upon analyzing the function and its input/output, it appears that the error may be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function is intended to perform aggregation on the data, but it seems to be encountering a TypeError when working with the Int64 dtype.

The input parameter values and types and the variables at the function's return seem to align with the issue described in the GitHub report. It appears that the function encounters a TypeError when trying to perform the aggregation with certain operations such as mean, median, and std.

To fix the bug, the function may need to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) in a way that does not lead to a TypeError. This could involve implementing specific handling for nullable integer data types in the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if isinstance(data.dtypes[0], pd.Int64Dtype):
        data = data.astype('float64')

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check for the Int64 dtype and convert the data to float64 to handle the nullable integer data type, which may prevent the TypeError issue that was reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected code aims to resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and ensure that the _cython_agg_blocks function can handle the Int64 dtype without encountering a TypeError.
