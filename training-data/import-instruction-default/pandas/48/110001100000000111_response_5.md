The buggy function is part of the Pandas library, and it is responsible for handling the aggregation of data for a DataFrameGroupBy object. The GitHub issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 data type, resulting in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types, especially when performing numeric aggregation operations. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which mentions that the error occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std`, but not when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`.

The bug's cause seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations, leading to a TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations needs to be revised. This includes addressing how the function processes numeric_only, casting blocks to the original dtype, and handling split object-dtype blocks. Additionally, the function should be enhanced to deal with nullable integer data types in line with the behavior of other aggregation functions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:

            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:

            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This corrected code aims to handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types more effectively, thereby resolving the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
