The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data using Cython, but it encounters a type casting error when trying to safely cast float64 to int64. This error occurs when trying to downcast numeric values, particularly when the result of an aggregation operation is a float64 and the original data type is int64.

The issue seems to be with the handling of data types during the aggregation process, specifically when attempting to downcast numeric values. The error message indicates that it's not possible to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the downcasting operation is performed in a safe and appropriate manner to avoid any type casting errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code remains the same)
    
    if numeric_only:
        # Downcast numeric data to avoid type casting errors
        data = data.convert_to_common_type()
    
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, the `data` is converted to a common type using the `convert_to_common_type` method to ensure that all numeric values are handled in a compatible manner. This approach should address the type casting error and allow the function to pass the failing test.
