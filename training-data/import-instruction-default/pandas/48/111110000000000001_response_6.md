The potential error in the provided function is related to the logic for handling the agg_blocks and split_frames. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the split_blocks and the subsequent manipulation of the new_items and agg_blocks lists. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results when using the function.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug could include revising the logic for handling split_blocks and ensuring that the new_items and agg_blocks lists are manipulated correctly. Additionally, making sure that the logic for handling deleted_items is comprehensive and error-free would be important.

Here's the corrected code for the provided function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
            # Adjusted the loop to include mgr_locs

            # Rest of the code remains unchanged

            if result is not no_result:
                # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                # Rest of the code remains unchanged

            new_items.append(mgr_locs)  # Using mgr_locs instead of locs
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)  # Using agg_block defined earlier

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
The corrected code focuses on accurately handling the new_items and agg_blocks lists, as well as ensuring the correct usage of mgr_locs in the function. These changes should address the potential bug and improve the function's behavior.
