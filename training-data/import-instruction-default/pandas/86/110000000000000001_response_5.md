1. The buggy function is a pivot function that performs pivoting on a DataFrame. It has some issues with handling the input parameters and setting the index for the pivot. The potential error location is in the conditional statements that check for the presence of the 'values' parameter.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional block that handles the case when 'values' is not None. It attempts to create a MultiIndex using the 'index' and 'columns' from the input data, but it does not handle the case when 'index' is None and 'values' is not None.

3. The bug's cause is the improper handling of input parameters and the creation of the MultiIndex when 'values' is not None.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the cases when 'index' is None and 'values' is not None, handling the index creation based on these conditions, and ensuring that the function behaves as expected for various input scenarios.

5. Here is the corrected code for the pivot function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        
        if columns is None:
            columns = data.columns
        
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            # create MultiIndex from values
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)

    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected code includes handling the case when 'index' is None and 'values' is not None, as well as ensuring that 'columns' is not None for creating the MultiIndex. This updated version should work as a drop-in replacement for the buggy function.
