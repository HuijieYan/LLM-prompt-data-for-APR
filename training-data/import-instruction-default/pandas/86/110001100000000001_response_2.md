# The buggy function is pivot, which is meant to pivot the DataFrame from long to wide format. The potential error location is within the conditional block that checks if values is None.
The bug's cause is due to incorrect handling of the values parameter when it is not None. This causes incorrect indexing and construction of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where values is not None and index is not None. Also, we need to ensure that the indexing and construction of the DataFrame is done correctly in all cases.

Below is the corrected code for the pivot function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)
        else:
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)
            
    return indexed
```

In this corrected version, the conditional block for handling the values parameter has been improved to correctly handle the case where values is not None. The indexing and construction of the DataFrame has been adjusted to ensure the correct pivot operation.
