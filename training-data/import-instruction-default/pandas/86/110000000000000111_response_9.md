1. The buggy function is a custom implementation of the pivot function for a DataFrame in pandas. The function is supposed to pivot the DataFrame based on the provided index, columns, and values. However, it is not handling the case where the 'columns' parameter is None properly, which is leading to the KeyError in certain scenarios.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the if condition handling the case when 'values' is None, but 'columns' is None.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a) The problematic function does not handle the case when 'columns' is None properly, and this leads to a KeyError when trying to pivot the DataFrame. This issue has been identified and reported in the GitHub issue.
   (b) According to the GitHub issue, the error message is confusing and should clearly indicate that 'columns' is not optional.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Add a check at the beginning of the function to raise an error if 'columns' is None.
   (b) Update the error message to clearly indicate that 'columns' is not optional, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function incorporating the fix:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:  # Check if 'columns' is None
        raise ValueError("The 'columns' parameter is not optional in pivot function.")

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index, columns=values)
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

By incorporating the fix, the function now checks if 'columns' is None at the beginning and raises a ValueError if it is. Additionally, the error message has been updated to clearly indicate that 'columns' is not optional, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
