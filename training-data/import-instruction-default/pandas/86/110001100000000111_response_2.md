The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the case when `columns` is `None`. This results in the `KeyError` being raised, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug's cause is that the function does not check whether `columns` is `None` or not before attempting to use it. This is inconsistent with the documentation, which states that `columns` is not optional.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to make sure `columns` is not `None`, and raise an error if it is. We also need to update the function to match the documented behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function that resolves the issue:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:  # check if columns is None
        raise ValueError("The 'columns' parameter is required in DataFrame.pivot")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved. The function now checks if `columns` is `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it is, in line with the documentation.
