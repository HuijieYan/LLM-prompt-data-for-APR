Analysis:
The function `pivot` takes four parameters as input: `data`, `index`, `columns`, and `values`. According to the documentation, `index` and `values` are optional, but `columns` is not. However, the error message raises confusion because it does not clearly mention that `columns` is not optional. The failing test is trying to call the `pivot` function with `columns=None` and it's expecting a specific error message, which is not being raised.

Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the function does not correctly handle the case when `columns` is passed as `None`. This results in a KeyError being raised, which does not provide a clear indication that `columns` cannot be `None`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function raises a specific error when `columns` is `None`.
2. Handle the case when `columns` is `None` in a way that aligns with the intended behavior of the function as described in the documentation.

Corrected Code:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:  # Added condition to handle the case when columns is None
        raise ValueError("columns cannot be None")

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for the `columns` parameter being `None`, and raises a ValueError if that is the case. This change aligns the behavior of the function with the documentation and resolves the confusion caused by the unclear error message. This corrected function is expected to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
