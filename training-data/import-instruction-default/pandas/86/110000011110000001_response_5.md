Potential error location: The issue is likely arising from the condition `if values is None`, as this leads to the `TypeError` being raised in the failing test when `columns` is not provided.

Bug's cause: The bug is caused by the fact that the function does not handle the case where `columns` is not provided correctly. This leads to a `TypeError` being raised when `columns` is missing, as observed in the failing test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle the case where `columns` is not provided by explicitly checking for its presence and raising an appropriate error if it is missing.
2. Provide a default value for `columns` to ensure that the function can handle cases where it is not explicitly provided.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if columns is None:
            raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected code includes a check to ensure that `columns` is not None in the case where `values` is also None. It raises a `TypeError` with an appropriate message if `columns` is missing. This fix should allow the function to pass the failing test and therefore address the bug.
