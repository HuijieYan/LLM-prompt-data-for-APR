The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be caused by a confusion between `Series` and `DataFrame` objects. This results in an `AttributeError` because the code tries to access the `columns` attribute on a `Series` object, which does not exist.

The issue appears to be in the segment of code that checks whether the `table` variable is empty and has more than 1 level in its columns before attempting to access the `columns` attribute. This is happening due to the dealing of `Series` instead of `DataFrame`.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to ensure that the `table` variable is a `DataFrame` before checking for the number of levels in its columns. This can be achieved by confirming that the `table` is an instance of a DataFrame, and only then proceed to access its columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:  # Check the number of levels in columns only if table is a DataFrame
            table = table.dropna(how="all")

            for v in values:
                if (
                    v in data
                    and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                    and v in agged
                    and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                ):
                    agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

    # existing code...
    return table
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle `Series` and `DataFrame` objects and prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring previously.

The corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post as well.
