The bug in the function is likely caused by the recursion that occurs when the function calls itself to handle multiple aggregation functions.

The potential error location is within the block of code that handles multiple aggregation functions. When the aggfunc parameter is a list, the function calls itself recursively for each function in the list, leading to a potential infinite recursion.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle multiple aggregation functions without recursive calls to the same function. We can iterate through the list of functions, perform the aggregation for each function, and then concatenate the results into a single DataFrame using the concat function.

Here is the corrected code for the pivot_table function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        table = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
    else:
        grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
        table = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # remaining code remains unchanged

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we handle multiple aggregation functions by iterating through the list of functions, performing the aggregation for each function, and then concatenating the results into a single DataFrame using the concat function. This avoids the issue of recursive calls to the same function when handling multiple aggregation functions.
