The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to how it handles the input `columns` parameter. The error message indicates that the function is trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, which suggests that there might be confusion with the variable name `columns`.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue arises from the recursion in the `pivot_table` function. When `aggfunc` is a list, the function calls itself with different parameters, and eventually, the `table` variable may end up being a Series rather than a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function should be replaced with an alternative method to calculate the table when `aggfunc` is a list. One approach could be to perform the aggregation in a loop without recursive calls. 

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = index + columns  # Join index and columns for keys
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)

        result = concat(pieces, keys=aggfunc, axis=1)
        return result

    # rest of the function remains unchanged as it handles non-list aggfunc case
    ...
```

By replacing the recursive call with a loop to perform the aggregation and concatenation separately, the issue of ending up with a Series instead of a DataFrame when `aggfunc` is a list is resolved.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue with the `pivot_table` function.
