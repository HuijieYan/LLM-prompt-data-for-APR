The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from the pandas library. The failing test is related to the `pivot_table` method when trying to pivot a DataFrame with a multi-index.

The error message indicates an attribute error of 'Series' object having no attribute 'columns', which suggests that a Series object is being used when a DataFrame is expected.

Reading through the failing test, the values for `columns` used in the failing test are in the form of tuple pairs and are used as input for the `pivot_table` method. However, the `pivot_table` method expects the `columns` parameter to be a list or a string, not a tuple.

Upon analyzing the failing test cases and considering the input/output variable information, it appears that the bug is caused by the `columns` parameter being passed as tuple pairs to the `pivot_table` method, which results in the method treating it as a Series object instead of the expected DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the `pivot_table` method needs to handle the `columns` parameter appropriately by converting tuple pairs to a list or using a different approach to handle multi-index columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` method:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):  # Handle multi-index columns
        columns = [columns]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to convert the `columns` parameter from a tuple to a list if it's in the form of tuple pairs. This will ensure that multi-index columns are handled correctly when passed to the `pivot_table` method.

This corrected version of the `pivot_table` method should now properly handle multi-index columns and pass the failing test cases.
