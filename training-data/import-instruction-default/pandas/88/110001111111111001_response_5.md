The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the way the `value` of `columns` is processed. The function, when called with multi-index columns, is incorrectly assigning it to a variable called `columns`. 

Upon further analysis, it appears that the `pivot_table` function is reusing the `columns` variable inappropriately, leading to the error. The function should avoid reusing the parameter names as local variables to avoid confusion and conflicts.

A possible approach to fixing this issue would be to rename the local variable `columns` to a different name, such as `converted_columns`, to avoid conflict with the input parameter `columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    converted_columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the `pivot_table` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
