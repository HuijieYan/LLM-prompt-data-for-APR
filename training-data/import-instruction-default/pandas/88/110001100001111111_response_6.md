On analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of multi-level columns in the `pivot_table` function, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to interact with the resulting Series object.

The potential cause of the bug seems to be the `table = table[values[0]]` line in the function and the handling of multi-level columns in the `pivot_table` function.

To fix this issue, the handling of multi-level columns should be improved to ensure that it correctly handles both single and multi-case, and that the resulting object is appropriately transformed based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    # previously existing code...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1 and not table.empty:
        if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
            table = DataFrame({k: table[k] for k in table.columns})
        elif values_passed and not values_multi:
            table = table[values[0]]
        elif values_multi:
            raise ValueError("values cannot be a list-like when columns are a MultiIndex")

    # previously existing code...

    return table
```

The corrected code ensures that the `table` object is correctly transformed when working with multi-level columns, and that the based on the input parameters. It also correctly handles the case where `values_passed` and `values_multi` are either true or false, and raises a ValueError if `values_multi` is true.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and provide the expected output, as well as prevent the AttributeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
