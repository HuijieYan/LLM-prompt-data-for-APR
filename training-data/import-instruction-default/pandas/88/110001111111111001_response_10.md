The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the use of the `columns` parameter. The function is trying to access the `nlevels` attribute directly on what appears to be a Series object, resulting in an AttributeError.

The cause of the bug could be that the `columns` parameter is being used inappropriately and is causing unexpected behavior within the function.

To fix the bug, an alternative approach is to review the way the `columns` parameter is being handled in the function and ensure that it is being used in a way that is compatible with the rest of the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # Original code attempting to access nlevels on columns directly
    # if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
    #     table = table[values[0]]

    if isinstance(columns, MultiIndex):
        if columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we've added an additional check for `columns` to ensure that it is an instance of `MultiIndex` before attempting to access its `nlevels` attribute. This change should address the AttributeError that was occurring in the original function.

This corrected version of the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test cases and handle the input/output variable information as expected.
