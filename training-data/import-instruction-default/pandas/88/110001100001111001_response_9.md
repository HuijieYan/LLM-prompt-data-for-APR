The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the input parameters and the subsequent manipulation of the data. One potential location for the bug is the section where the `values` parameter is processed, as the function checks if `values` is a list-like object and then performs operations based on whether it is a list or not.

The bug seems to be caused by the processing of the `values` parameter and how it is used to subset the `data` DataFrame. This is evident from the values of the `values_passed` and `values_multi` variables, which are used in subsequent operations.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to re-evaluate how the `values` parameter is processed and how it is used to subset the `data` DataFrame. It may also be necessary to check the behavior of the function when `values` is a single column name versus a list of column names.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        if not is_list_like(values):
            values = [values]

        for value in values:
            if value not in data.columns:
                raise KeyError(value)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return table
```

This corrected code attempts to address the potential issues with the processing of the `values` parameter and how it is used to subset the `data` DataFrame. However, further testing and validation may be necessary to ensure that the bug has been fully addressed.
