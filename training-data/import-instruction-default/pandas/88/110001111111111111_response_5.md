The issue seems to stem from the buggy `pivot_table` function where it is not handling multi-index columns correctly. The error occurs when the function tries to access the `nlevels` attribute on a series, causing the AttributeError.

The root cause is likely related to the way the function handles the input when columns are specified as a multi-index tuple.

A possible fix for this bug is to ensure that the function handles multi-index columns correctly and does not try to access attributes that are only available for DataFrames and not Series objects.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas import MultiIndex

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing function body

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    if columns is not None and isinstance(columns, list):
        if all(isinstance(col, tuple) for col in columns):
            columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(columns)

    # existing function body

    return table
```

The above fix includes handling the case where `columns` is a tuple and converting it to a list of tuples so that it can be properly handled when creating the MultiIndex. This fix should address the problem with multi-index columns and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub. Additionally, it should also pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
