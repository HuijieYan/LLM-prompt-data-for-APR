Potential error location: The error occurs when trying to access the `columns` attribute on a DataFrame. This happens in the line `if table.columns.nlevels > 1` where `table` is assumed to be a DataFrame, but in some cases, it might be a Series.

Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `pivot_table` is assuming that the `table` variable will always hold a DataFrame, so it tries to access the `columns` attribute directly, which fails if `table` is a Series.
- This error is reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check the type of the `table` variable before accessing its `columns` attribute and convert a Series to DataFrame if necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged)
    
    keys = index + columns
    # ... (unchanged)

    table = agged
    # The following if condition checks if `table` is a series and converts it to a DataFrame
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = DataFrame(table)
    
    # The rest of the function remains the same

    # GH 15193 Make sure empty columns are removed if dropna=True
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

By adding a check for `ABCDataFrame` and `ABCSeries`, and converting the `table` to a DataFrame if it's a Series, the corrected code addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
