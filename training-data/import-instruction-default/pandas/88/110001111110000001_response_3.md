The problematic function is `pivot_table` which is part of the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The relevant related functions are `pivot_table`, `_add_margins`, and `_convert_by` which are also part of the same file. The failing test trying to call the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns is failing due to an `AttributeError` which says that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the `table` is defined. The code infers the wrong type for the `table` variable, resulting in the 'Series' object that causes the 'AttributeError' when trying to access 'columns' later in the code.

The bug's cause is that the `table` variable is being incorrectly inferred to be a 'Series' object instead of a 'DataFrame' object. This is happening due to incorrect type handling or the result from grouping and aggregating the data.

To fix the bug, the type inference for the `table` variable needs to be corrected so that it always gets the 'DataFrame' object. This involves making sure the result of the grouping and aggregation operations always returns a 'DataFrame' object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # convert the result to DataFrame to ensure correct type
    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):
        agged = agged.to_frame()

    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return agged  # return the 'agged' DataFrame instead of 'table'
```

With this corrected code, the `pivot_table` function should now pass the failing test when called with multi-index columns.
