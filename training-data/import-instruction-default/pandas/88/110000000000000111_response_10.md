The buggy function `pivot_table` is causing an AttributeError when the `pivot_table` is called with multi-index columns, as demonstrated in the provided GitHub issue. The error occurs at line 174 of the function, where it checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. This causes an AttributeError because `table` is a `DataFrame` when the `pivot_table` is called with multi-index columns, but it is treated as a `Series` object in this part of the code.

The root cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle multi-index columns properly, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access `table.columns.nlevels` for a multi-index DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to be modified to handle multi-index columns correctly and avoid the AttributeError. This can be achieved by adding conditional checks to ensure that `table` is treated as a `DataFrame` when checking for its levels. Additionally, the function should preserve the `DataFrame` structure when returning the result.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and isinstance(table, DataFrame)  # Check if table is a DataFrame
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return table
```

With this corrected version, the `pivot_table` function explicitly checks if `table` is a `DataFrame` before accessing its columns and appropriately handles the multi-index columns case. This should address the AttributeError issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly with multi-index columns.
