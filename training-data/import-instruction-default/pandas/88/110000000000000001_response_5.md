The potential error in the function is the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list)` block. This recursive call can lead to an infinite loop and result in the function not returning the expected output.

The bug's cause is the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list)` block. This call creates an infinite loop due to the lack of a base case to stop the recursion.

To fix the bug, we can replace the recursive call with direct application of the `aggfunc` to `grouped` and store the results in a dictionary. Then, we can use this dictionary to construct the resulting DataFrame with the desired keys.

Here's the corrected code with the fix:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
    
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        result_dict = {}
        for func in aggfunc:
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
                
                # Add to result dictionary
                result_dict[func.__name__] = agged
        
        # Construct the resulting DataFrame using the dictionary
        table = pd.concat(result_dict, axis=1, keys=aggfunc)
        
        return table
```

By replacing the recursive call with direct application of `aggfunc` to `grouped` and then constructing the resulting DataFrame using the dictionary, we have fixed the bug in the function.
