The bug in the function `pivot_table` seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns. When the function encounters a multi-index column, it raises an AttributeError because it expects the `columns` attribute to have multiple levels, but it's actually a Series object. This is consistent with the reported GitHub issue, which shows a stack trace indicating an AttributeError when calling `pivot_table` with multi-index columns.

The issue seems to be located in the section of the code where the function checks for `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. It assumes that `table.columns` is always a MultiIndex, but it can be a Series if the table has only one column. This assumption leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute of a Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when `table.columns` is a Series instead of a MultiIndex. We can check the type of `table.columns` and adjust the logic accordingly to handle both single-column and multi-column cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # (unchanged)

    keys = index + columns

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # new logic to handle single/multi-column cases
    if isinstance(table.columns, pd.MultiIndex) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]
    else:
        table = table.to_frame(name=values[0])

    # (rest of the code remains the same)

    return table
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case when `table.columns` is a Series by converting it to a DataFrame with a single column. This should resolve the AttributeError reported in the GitHub issue and also provide the correct behavior for multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function.
