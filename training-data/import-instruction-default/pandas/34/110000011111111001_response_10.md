The bug is likely in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method, where the `binner` and `bin_edges` variables are being calculated incorrectly, leading to incorrect binning and resulting in the ambiguous time error message in the failing test.

The issue appears to be related to the assignment of `binner` and `bin_edges` in the `_get_time_bins` function, and the subsequent use of these variables to generate bins in the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` call. It seems that the binning logic is not handling the time zone changes correctly, leading to the ambiguous time error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the binner and bin_edges are correctly adjusted to handle time zone changes, so that the bins can be generated without ambiguity.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward" if self.freq.n == 1 else "NaT",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we've adjusted the generation of the `binner` and `bin_edges` to handle time zone changes while also accommodating nanosecond parts and time zone frequency differences in the `nonexistent` parameter.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
