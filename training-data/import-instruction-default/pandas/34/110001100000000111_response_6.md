The buggy function is `_get_time_bins` and it seems to be related to the `groupby` method when dealing with daily frequency data. The GitHub issue describes how the `groupby` method fails with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba, which is related to handling ambiguous timestamps.

The potential error in the problematic function may be related to how it handles time bins and labels, especially on clock change days with ambiguous timestamps.

The bug's cause is due to the function's inability to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba, which leads to an AmbiguousTimeError. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where the groupby method is expected to return the correct groups for each day, but it fails due to the ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle ambiguous timestamps properly, especially on clock change days in Cuba. This may involve adjusting how the time bins and labels are generated to account for the ambiguous timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    if ax.tz != first.tz:
        first = first.tz_convert(ax.tz)
    if ax.tz != last.tz:
        last = last.tz_convert(ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should properly handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
