The potential error in the problematic function is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock-change days. This can lead to an AmbiguousTimeError, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

The bug seems to be caused by the failure of pd.Grouper to handle ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock-change days in certain timezones, such as Cuba. 
The code tries to handle the time range using date_range, but it doesn't account for the ambiguous time and may result in incorrect labeling.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days, specifically by adjusting the generation of time bins and labels to account for these ambiguities. This can be done by properly handling the timezone, ambiguous timestamps, and daylight saving time.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the code handles the relationship between pandas' index, time ranges, and ambiguous timestamps appropriately. This involves updating the date_range with appropriate parameters to handle any potential conflicts.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed,
            ambiguous='infer',
            nonexistent='shift_forward'
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, we have added proper timezone handling and considered ambiguous timestamps by setting the `ambiguous` parameter in our date_range call to 'infer'. This allows pandas to handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately, avoiding the AmbiguousTimeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
