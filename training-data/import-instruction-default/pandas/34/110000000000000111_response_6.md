1. The buggy function is responsible for getting time bins for a given axis. It is closely related to the GitHub issue as the issue is related to the groupby function with daily frequency failing on clock change day in Cuba. The issue is caused by an AmbiguousTimeError, which is related to handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on long clock-change days in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the date_range function call, where the ambiguous timestamps are not handled appropriately.

3. The bug's cause is related to the failure to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError, particularly in the context of daily frequency groupby operations on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The problematic function may not be handling the time bins and labels properly, leading to the error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include handling ambiguous timestamps correctly within the date_range function call, ensuring that the labels and bins align appropriately without resulting in AmbiguousTimeError during groupby operations.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected function should handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately within the date_range function call, addressing the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
