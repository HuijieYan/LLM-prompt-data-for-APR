1. Analysis:
The problematic function _get_time_bins is used in the failing test function as a part of the test for downsampling a dataframe. The test involves using the pandas library to group the data by a specific frequency. The error message in the failing test indicates an AmbiguousTimeError when the groupby function is called. This error is related to daylight saving time and ambiguous time issues.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how it handles time bins and labels, especially around times when daylight saving time occurs.

3. Bug's Cause:
The bug is causing an AmbiguousTimeError due to the handling of time bins and labels when dealing with daylight saving time. The issue was posted on GitHub and described how the groupby function failed to handle ambiguous timestamps, specifically on a long clock-change day in Cuba.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the handling of ambiguous time during the creation of time bins and labels, especially on days when daylight saving time affects the timestamps.

5. Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function that addresses the issue with ambiguous time and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous time by setting to NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code snippet includes a modification to the date_range function call by adding the ambiguous argument and setting it to "NaT" to handle ambiguous time. This change addresses the issue related to ambiguous timestamps and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
