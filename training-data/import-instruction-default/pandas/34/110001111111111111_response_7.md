The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` is likely to be related to the handling of the time bins and labels on the day of the clock change in Cuba. In particular, the code seems to generate the bins and labels incorrectly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The issue arises when the inference of the DST time from the timestamp on 2018-11-04 00:00:00 is not handled properly.

To fix this bug, the logic for generating the time bins and labels needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous time due to the clock change on November 4th, 2018 in Cuba.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last + self.freq,  # Adjust for the potential ambiguity
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Adjust the labels to match the bins
    labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the end time for the `date_range` by `self.freq`, we ensure that the potential ambiguous time is handled correctly. Additionally, by defining `labels` based on `binner[1:]`, we align the labels with the bins. These changes should resolve the issue and provide the expected output for the failing test.

The corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function is provided above, which incorporates the necessary adjustments to handle the ambiguous time due to the clock change in Cuba. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
