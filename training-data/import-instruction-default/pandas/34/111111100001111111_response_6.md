The issue here is related to the time change in Cuba on November 4th, 2018, which results in an ambiguous timestamp. This causes the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `groupby` function with a daily frequency.

The problematic code is within the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class. The issue arises due to the way the `date_range` is created, leading to ambiguous timestamps on the day of the time change in Cuba. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to create bins and labels for the data.

The potential solution involves adjusting the method for creating the `date_range` with proper handling of ambiguous timestamps on the day of the time change in Cuba.

To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, a custom function should be created to handle the creation of the `date_range` while considering ambiguous times on days where the time changes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    bin_edges = [first]
    while first < last:
        first = first + self.freq
        bin_edges.append(first)

    labels = bin_edges[:-1]
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        bins = len(bin_edges) - 1
    else:
        bins = len(bin_edges) - 1
        bin_edges[-1] = last

    binner = labels

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This modified function handles the ambiguous timestamps during time changes by creating the `bin_edges` and `labels` without encountering ambiguous times. This should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub link.
