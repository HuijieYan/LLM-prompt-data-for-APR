The bug is caused by the `pd.Grouper` function not handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in certain timezones. This causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when trying to group the data.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels`.

The failing test provides a specific example of the issue, where a dataframe is created with timestamps in a timezone affected by a clock change, and then an attempt to group the data using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency raises an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The GitHub issue provides further context about the problem and the expected output. It also mentions that a similar issue was fixed in a previous version of pandas, but this specific scenario is still causing an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include making adjustments to how the `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels` are calculated, handling ambiguous timestamps more effectively, and considering the behavior of the `pd.Grouper` function on clock change days.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_tz = ax.tz  # Store original timezone information
    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Remove timezone for calculations
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax_tz,  # Set the original timezone back
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function includes changes to handle timezone information more effectively and adjust the calculations accordingly. This function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
