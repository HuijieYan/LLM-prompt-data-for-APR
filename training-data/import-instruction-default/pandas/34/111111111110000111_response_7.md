1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class located in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The failing test is trying to downsample data grouped by a daily frequency, which raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a clock change day in Cuba. The GitHub issue title indicates that this bug is specifically related to the handling of daily frequency on clock change days in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the `date_range` function is called to create bins and labels. This function call is where the AmbiguousTimeError is being raised.

3. Elucidation of the bug's cause:
   (a). The `_get_time_bins` function within the `TimeGrouper` class is used to create time bins and labels for the grouped data.
   (b). The related functions include `_adjust_bin_edges` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges` which are used by the `_get_time_bins` function.
   (c). The failing test is trying to group data with a daily frequency, but the AmbiguousTimeError is raised due to the handling of clock change days in Cuba.
   (d). The error message indicates that the issue arises from creating bins and labels using the `date_range` function.
   (e). The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem and the expected outputs.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for ambiguous times and handle them appropriately when creating bins and labels.
   - Ensure that the bins and labels accurately reflect the timestamps, especially on clock change days in Cuba.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `TimeGrouper._get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first.replace(tzinfo=None),
        end=last.replace(tzinfo=None),
        tz=None,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels

```

With the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function, it should now appropriately handle ambiguous times and create bins and labels that accurately reflect the timestamps, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
