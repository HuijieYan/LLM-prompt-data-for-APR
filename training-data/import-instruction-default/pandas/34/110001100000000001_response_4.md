The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `date_range` function to generate the `binner` and `labels`. It seems that the `date_range` function may not be providing the expected result or that the subsequent manipulation of `binner` and `labels` may be incorrect.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the incorrect usage or manipulation of the `date_range` function to generate `binner` and `labels`.

One approach for fixing the bug would be to review the usage of the `date_range` function and the subsequent manipulation of `binner` and `labels` to ensure that they are correctly generated and adjusted. Additionally, checking for potential off-by-one errors when manipulating the `binner` and `labels` lists could also be helpful.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    bins = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz)
    
    if len(bins) > 1:
        bins = bins.insert(0, bins[0] - (bins[1] - bins[0]))
        
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(bins, ax.asi8)

    labels = bins[1:]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code focuses on simplifying the creation and adjustment of the `bins`, `binner`, and `labels` lists. It ensures that the correct bins are generated and adjusted for the given frequency.
