1. The buggy function _get_time_bins is part of the TimeGrouper class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function calculates time bins but fails when there are ambiguous timestamps, such as during a clock change.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the date_range function call, specifically during midnight on a clock change day. This call fails to handle ambiguous timestamps, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

3. Bug cause:
   (a). The function _get_time_bins in the TimeGrouper class is not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b). The related functions such as date_range and _adjust_bin_edges are used to calculate the time bins, but they do not appropriately handle ambiguous timestamps.
   (c). The failing test test_downsample_dst_at_midnight provides a specific scenario where the bug occurs, and the error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is raised during the groupby operation.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information confirms that the issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days and expects the groupby operation to handle such cases correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Improve handling of ambiguous timestamps within the _get_time_bins function, possibly by using proper timezone information and taking into account the possible ambiguity.
   (b). Update the date_range and _adjust_bin_edges functions to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
   (c). Ensure that the groupby operation within the TimeGrouper class handles ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            periods=len(ax),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function handles ambiguous timestamps by using the `ambiguous="infer"` option in the `date_range` function. This allows the function to infer the existence of ambiguous times within the range, addressing the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub Issue.
