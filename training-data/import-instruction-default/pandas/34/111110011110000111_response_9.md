1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` is trying to group by the data using a daily frequency (`1D`) for a specific date range. The error message indicates that there is an AmbiguousTimeError related to the clock change day in Cuba. The GitHub issue details this problem as well and expects the call to `groupby` to return three groups corresponding to each day.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of time bins and labels, and the way the date range is generated.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days in the `date_range` function. This leads to an AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group the data at daily frequency, causing the test to fail. The GitHub issue provides additional context and expected output, highlighting this specific behavior as a bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the method of generating the date range to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock-change days more effectively.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the TimeGrouper class with the fixed _get_time_bins function
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # other class methods and attributes

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        # Handle ambiguous time on clock change day
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous='infer')
        first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
            ambiguous='infer', nonexistent='shift_forward'
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code uses the `tz_localize` method to handle ambiguous times on clock change days and creates the date range accordingly. It addresses the specific behavior causing the AmbiguousTimeError and should pass the failing test while resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Please note that this corrected code assumes there are no issues with other methods and that the rest of the `TimeGrouper` and related classes work as expected.
