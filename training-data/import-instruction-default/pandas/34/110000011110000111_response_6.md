The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically at the point where the `date_range` function is being used.

The failing test function 'test_downsample_dst_at_midnight' provides a datetime index that is tz_localized and tz_converted, and then tries to group by a frequency of "1D". The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is being raised when the `groupby` operation is being attempted on a long clock-change day in Cuba.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem, where on a clock-change day in Cuba, the `pd.Grouper` does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError when attempting to group by a daily frequency.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to address the handling of ambiguous time on clock-change days in the `date_range` function within the `_get_time_bins` function. One possible approach could be to add handling for ambiguous times when generating the date range, ensuring that the timestamps are correctly labeled and include all the required data points.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the handling of ambiguous time on clock-change days:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected version should now handle ambiguous times on clock-change days and should pass the failing test, thereby resolving the issue reported in the GitHub post.
