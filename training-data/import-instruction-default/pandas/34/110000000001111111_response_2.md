The buggy function is supposed to group time series data into daily bins using the `pandas` library. However, the function fails to handle ambiguous time on days like the clock change day in Cuba, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

The given runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables before the function's return seem to be correct, based on the GitHub issue's details. The primary error location within the function is likely the generation of bin labels using the `date_range` function.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output variable values is the key to understanding the bug's cause. The issue on the GitHub mentions that the call to `groupby` should return three groups, one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), and the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain 25 hourly data points for this day. The data is being incorrectly split due to the ambiguous time on the clock change day, causing the error.

To fix the bug, the function should handle ambiguous time properly and ensure that the bins are labeled and grouped correctly based on the time zone changes.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Create the start and end timestamps based on the time range
    start = ax.min().normalize()
    end = ax.max().normalize()

    binner = pd.date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # generate bins based on the adjustments
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    # Handle ambiguous times
    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = binner.insert(0, NaT)

    # ensure that labels match the bins
    if len(bins) < len(binner):
        labels = binner[: len(bins)]
    else:
        labels = binner

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function should effectively handle the ambiguous time issue and return the expected output for the given problematic use case.
