The issue occurs due to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when trying to group data for the problematic date in Cuba. The problem originates from the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class, which fails to handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change.

The GitHub issue provides a failing test that highlights the problem by trying to group data on a date in Cuba where a clock change occurs. The error message further clarifies that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised, and the issue description provides expected output and versions of pandas and related libraries.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class to handle ambiguous timestamps during a clock change correctly.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the ambiguous timestamps explicitly by using the `ambiguous` parameter of the `date_range` function and adjusting the frequency accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other methods)
    
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        if ax[0].dst():
            first = first - pd.Timedelta('1D')
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        # ... (other code)
```

This code should handle the ambiguous timestamps during a clock change in the `America/Havana` timezone, and it should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Please note that the usage of `ax[0].dst()` and the adjustment of the `first` timestamp may vary based on the specific requirements and nuances of the actual data and timezone involved.
