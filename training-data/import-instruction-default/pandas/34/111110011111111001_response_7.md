There are several issues with the `_get_time_bins` function, which are causing the test to fail. The specific root cause of the error is the misuse of `date_range` to create bins and labels for the time grouping. This results in ambiguous time errors when timezones are involved. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `date_range` function creates non-ambiguous time ranges and correctly adjusts the bin edges.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)

    # Create bins and labels using bins method to avoid timezone ambiguity
    binner, bin_edges = self._generate_bins(ax, first, last)
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    return binner, bins, binner


def _generate_bins(self, ax, start, end):
    binner = date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name)

    # adjust the bin edges
    bin_edges = np.concatenate([binner.asi8, [binner.asi8[-1] + self.freq.nanos]])

    return binner, bin_edges
```

In this corrected version, the `_generate_bins` method creates appropriate bins and adjusts the bin edges correctly. This should resolve the ambiguity error and ensure that the time grouping works as expected.
