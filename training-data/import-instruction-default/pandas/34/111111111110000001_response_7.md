There seems to be an issue with the time bins generated in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class within the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. The error message indicates a problem with ambiguous time, and the failing test also directly involves a conversion to a specific time zone, hinting that the issue could be related to time zone processing.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the tz-localized timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function. The timestamps are processed and converted to bins based on the closed frequency, but there seems to be an issue with the handling of ambiguous time during the binning process, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, you can adjust the binning process to handle ambiguous time correctly. This can be done by explicitly specifying the ambiguous time handling strategy when generating the bins. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the time zone conversions more robustly to avoid ambiguous time errors.

In the corrected code below, the `ambiguous` parameter is added to the `date_range` function with the value set to `NaT` to handle ambiguous times. Additionally, the `nonexistent` parameter is set to `nonexistent="shift_forward"` to handle nonexistent times appropriately.

            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

```
With these changes, the correction aims to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times more robustly during the binning process, which should address the error reported in the failing test.
