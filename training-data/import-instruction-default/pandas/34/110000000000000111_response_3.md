1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to generate time bins and labels for a given DatetimeIndex. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the `pd.Grouper` function failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The function in question seems to be related to this issue as it deals with the generation of time bins and labels.

2. The potential error within the problematic function could be related to the generation of time bins and labels, especially in scenarios where there are ambiguous timestamps due to clock changes.

3. The bug's cause is related to the function's inability to handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock change days. This is evident from the GitHub issue, where the user expects the call to `groupby` to return three groups, one for each day, but encounters an AmbiguousTimeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Adding handling for ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days.
   b. Ensuring that the function can properly handle time bins and labels even in scenarios with ambiguous timestamps.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        closed=self.closed  # Add closed argument to date_range
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected code, the `closed` argument is added to the `date_range` function call to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days. This modification should address the AmbiguousTimeError and ensure that the function behaves as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
