The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function is likely to be caused by incorrect label assignment and manipulation. The error message from the failing test shows that there is an issue with the ambiguous time when converting the timezone. This indicates that the time binning and labeling logic in the `_get_time_bins` function is not handling the timezone conversion correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the time labels are being created and adjusted, especially considering the AMBIGUOUS time error message in the failing test. One possibility is that the timezone-related adjustments are not being properly handled when creating the labels, causing the error at midnight, for example, during the transition from daylight saving time to standard time.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the timezone is correctly handled during label creation and adjustments. Additionally, specific handling for ambiguous and nonexistent times in the date range label creation process might be required. This could involve using the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters of the `date_range` function to handle such situations explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, 
        end=last, 
        freq=self.freq, 
        tz=ax.tz, 
        name=ax.name, 
        ambiguous="infer", 
        nonexistent="shift_forward"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner[1:] if self.label == "right" else binner
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the timezone is explicitly handled during label creation and adjustment by specifying the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters when creating the date range. It also makes adjustments to the labels based on the `closed` and `label` parameters, and handles situations where there are more labels than bins.
