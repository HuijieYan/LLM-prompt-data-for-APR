The problem highlighted in the GitHub issue is that the call to groupby raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The expected output is that the call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (before the clock change) and should contain the 25 hourly data points for this day.

The failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` invokes the `groupby` method on a DataFrame using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` which in particular performs daily frequency downsampling operation. This operation fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the erroneous behavior of the `_get_time_bins` function in handling the timestamp ranges that contain ambiguous or non-existent times as a result of daylight saving time transitions.

Looking at the failing test's input parameters, we see that a `DatetimeIndex` is passed to the `_get_time_bins` function, and the variables `binner`, `labels`, `first`, `last`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins` are used within the function. The behavior of the function is incorrect, which means it does not handle time ranges that span daylight saving time transitions correctly. This leads to the generation of incorrect bins, consequently causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the `groupby` operation is performed.

To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect handling of timestamp ranges in the `_get_time_bins` function.

In particular, we need to change the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to account for the presence of ambiguous times and non-existent times, especially around the day when the daylight saving time transition occurs. This involves ensuring that the time bins and labels correctly represent the timestamps, accounting for the ambiguity in time due to daylight saving time changes.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = labels = ax.round(self.freq)
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected function, we ensure that the `binner` and `labels` are rounded to the frequency before being used. This is done to handle any ambiguity in the timestamps due to Daylight Saving Time transitions. Additionally, the adjustment of bin edges is performed based on the rounded `binner` values to ensure that the bins represent the ranges correctly.

With the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the `groupby` operation should now handle the daylight saving time transitions correctly and no longer raise the `AmbiguousTimeError`. This should also satisfy the expected output provided in the GitHub issue.
