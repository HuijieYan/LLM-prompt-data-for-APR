The buggy function is `_get_time_bins`, which is a method in the `TimeGrouper` class. This class is used to group time series data in a `DataFrame` object by time intervals.

The input parameter `ax` must be a `DatetimeIndex`, and it is checked in the function using `isinstance`. If it is not a `DatetimeIndex`, a `TypeError` is raised. 

The issue that was detailed on GitHub is that there is an `AmbiguousTimeError` raised when there is an ambiguous timestamp, such as during a clock change day in Cuba. This means that the function is failing to handle ambiguous time stamps.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types, including the input parameters and the variables within the function, it can be observed that the ``_get_time_bins`` function calls the private method `_adjust_bin_edges` which is not visible from the provided source code, potentially causing the function to fail to correctly handle ambiguous timestamps.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to make sure that the function and the private method `_adjust_bin_edges` handle ambiguous timestamps correctly. This can include checking for ambiguous timestamps and handling them appropriately according to the requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # handle ambiguous timestamps
    if ax_values[0] == ax_values[-1]:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function includes logic to handle ambiguous timestamps and ensures that the proper handling of ambiguous timestamps is implemented as per the requirements outlined in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` issue described in the GitHub issue.
