The bug is likely caused by an issue with handling ambiguous time on the day of the clock change in Cuba. The `DatetimeIndex` ax is being converted to a `DateRange` and the manipulation of the time zones on the day of the clock change appears to be causing issues.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem is that the call to `groupby()` raises an AmbiguousTimeError on the day of the clock change, which suggests that the handling of ambiguous time zones is not correctly handled.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle ambiguous time on the day of the clock change.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    if first.tz != last.tz:
        last = last + pd.Timedelta(1, 'h')

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code takes into account the potential for ambiguous time and handles it by adding 1 hour to the last timestamp if the time zone at the first timestamp is different from the time zone at the last timestamp.

This fix should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError issue described in the GitHub issue and produces the expected output.
