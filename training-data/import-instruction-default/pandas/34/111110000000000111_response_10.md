1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in pandas. The GitHub issue describes the problem of the groupby function failing with a daily frequency, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of timestamps on clock change days, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins for the groupby operation. It uses the pandas library to handle timestamps and time intervals.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class contains the buggy function and is responsible for custom time-interval grouping.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a specific example of the problem occurring on a clock change day in Cuba, causing the AmbiguousTimeError. It also includes the expected output and the environment details.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the logic in the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, potentially using different methods to align the time bins and labels with the actual timestamps.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `TimeGrouper._get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Handle ambiguous times by filling with NaT
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the handling of ambiguous times has been updated to use NaT (Not-a-Time) instead of "infer". This change addresses the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub report and should resolve the problem with daily frequency groupby failing on clock change days in Cuba.
