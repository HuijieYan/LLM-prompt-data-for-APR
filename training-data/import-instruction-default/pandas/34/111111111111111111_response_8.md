The problem arises from the fact that on some clock-change days, the timestamps are ambiguous and leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when grouping by daily frequency. The `DatetimeIndex` that is being used for grouping has timestamps that lead to this error, and the issue seems to be related to how the binning process is handled.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function in the `TimeGrouper` class. Instead of using the `date_range` function to generate the bins, we should modify it to handle ambiguous times and generate the bins accordingly. Additionally, we should handle the case where there are more labels than bins and adjust accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This version of the function handles ambiguous times using the `ambiguous="infer"` argument of the `date_range` function. It also adjust the labels if there are more labels than bins.

This revised version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.
