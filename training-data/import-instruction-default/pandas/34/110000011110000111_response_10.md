The issue arises when using the groupby function on a daily frequency and encountering a clock change day in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. This is due to the pd.Grouper not handling the ambiguous timestamp at midnight local time on the clock change day.

The potential error location is within the _get_time_bins function, specifically in the date_range function, where the ambiguous timestamp is not handled properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The failing test 'test_downsample_dst_at_midnight' provides a specific example of the issue, where the test is trying to downsample data with daily frequency on a clock change day, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.

The GitHub issue gives a detailed description of the problem, explaining that on the long clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, which is not handled as expected by pd.Grouper, leading to the error. The expected output is that the call to groupby should return three groups, one for each day, and the group for the ambiguous day should specify the timestamp before the clock change and contain the data points for that day.

To fix the bug, the date_range function within the _get_time_bins function needs to be modified to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, ensuring that it returns the expected output when used in conjunction with pd.Grouper.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
