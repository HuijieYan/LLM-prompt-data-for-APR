The bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the `date_range` for creating `binner` and `labels` does not handle ambiguous times properly. This results in an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the data falls on a day with a time change, as is the case in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `date_range` handles ambiguous times properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Set the time to midnight
    last = ax[-1] + self.freq  # Increment by the frequency to ensure the last bin is included

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        ambiguous="infer",
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this correction, the `date_range` is adjusted to handle ambiguous times properly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function works as expected with the provided test case.
