The bug in the `_get_time_bins` function appears to be related to how the bin edges are calculated and used. The function is trying to create time bins for the given `DatetimeIndex` `ax`, and errors are occurring when the time bins don't align with the given timezone information (in this case, "America/Havana").

To fix the bug, we can adjust the calculation of the bin edges and the generation of the time bins to ensure that they align correctly with the timezone information.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adjusting the calculation of `first` and `last` to account for timezone differences.
2. Using the timezone information when generating the time bins and labels.
3. Handling ambiguous times that may result from timezone conversions.

We would need to make sure that the `first` and `last` timestamp objects have the correct timezone information and that it is preserved throughout the calculation of `binner`, `bin_edges`, and `labels`.

Additionally, handling ambiguous times may involve checking for and resolving any ambiguous times that could arise when converting between timezones.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].tz_localize(None).floor(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT')
    last = ax[-1].tz_localize(None).ceil(self.freq, ambiguous='NaT')

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
        label=self.label,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

With the updated `_get_time_bins` function, the corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
