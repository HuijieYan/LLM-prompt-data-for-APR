The bug lies in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method which is not shown in the provided code. This method is used to adjust the bin edges based on the frequency and it seems to be causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin edges are calculated correctly and that the binning process is done accurately. It seems like the discrepancy arises from the way bin edges are adjusted, so it's necessary to review the logic in the `_adjust_bin_edges` method.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8

    # The bug is related to the _adjust_bin_edges method
    bin_edges = ax_values
    # Adjusting the bins based on frequency
    bin_edges = np.sort(bin_edges)
    edges = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, has_nans=ax.hasnans)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This suggested corrected code uses the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` method to generate the bins based on the adjusted `bin_edges`. This should help in resolving the bug and providing accurate bins and labels as per the expected output.
