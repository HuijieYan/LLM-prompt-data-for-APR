1. The buggy function is related to the GitHub issue by being a part of the code responsible for groupby with daily frequency, which is failing on clock change day in Cuba due to an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where the date_range is used to create bins and labels for the grouping. This is where the incorrect labeling of the ambiguous timestamps occurs.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps in the date_range function used to create bins and labels for the groupby operation. The GitHub issue specifically mentions the AmbiguousTimeError and describes the expected output, which is not being achieved due to the bug in the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adjusting the date_range function parameters to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.
   b. Adding handling for ambiguous timestamps in the code by checking for them and applying the appropriate labels.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue posted in the GitHub:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
