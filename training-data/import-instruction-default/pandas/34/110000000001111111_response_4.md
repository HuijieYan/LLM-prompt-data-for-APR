The potential error location within the function is most likely in the date_range function call where the start and end dates are derived from the first and last values of the input DatetimeIndex, as well as the binner and labels arrays that are then adjusted based on the input frequency. This is where the issue related to ambiguous time occurring on the clock change day in Cuba seems to be rooted.

The bug's cause seems to be insufficient handling of ambiguous time occurring on the clock change day in Cuba, as reported in the GitHub issue. The date_range function does not handle this properly, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to adjust the start and end dates passed to the date_range function to account for the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba. Additionally, special handling for ambiguous times may be required when generating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function based on the analysis and GitHub issue:

```python
# corrected version of the function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = ax.min(), ax.max()
    
    # adjust the start and end dates to account for the ambiguous time
    if len(ax) > 1:
        first = first.tz_localize(None)
        last = last.tz_localize(None)

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        first, last, self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the start and end dates passed to the date_range function are adjusted to account for the ambiguous time, and special handling for ambiguous times has also been considered in generating the bins and labels. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and provide the expected output.
