The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is designed to generate time bins and labels based on the input `ax` which is expected to be a `DatetimeIndex`. The function calculates the first and last time stamps, and then generates the bins and labels based on the frequency, start, and end time stamps.

The potential error is that the binning logic is not producing the correct output due to incorrect calculations.

The bug appears to be caused by incorrect calculations related to the time zone information, frequency, and start/end date ranges.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the date range is calculated correctly based on the frequency and time zone, and that the bins and labels are generated accurately. Additionally, the condition for handling NaN values needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = self._get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base, tz=ax.tz
    )

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        closed=self.closed,
        name=ax.name,
    )
    
    bin_edges = np.concatenate([binner, [binner[-1] + self.freq]])
    
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, bin_edges, closed=self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected code, the function should now accurately calculate the time bins and labels based on the input `ax` and the specified frequency and time zone. This should resolve the issues causing the failing tests.
