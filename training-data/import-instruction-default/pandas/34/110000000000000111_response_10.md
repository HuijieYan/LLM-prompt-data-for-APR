1. The function `_get_time_bins` is used in the context of grouping time series data. The GitHub issue describes a problem with grouping data with daily frequency when there is a clock change, which results in an AmbiguousTimeError. The provided function is related to the issue because it's involved in the process of creating time bins for grouping the data.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely the calculation of the time bins using the `date_range` function. Since the issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps due to a clock change, the creation of time bins might not be handling such cases properly.

3. The buggy function is responsible for creating time bins for grouping time series data. The GitHub issue is related to a problem in grouping data with daily frequency, especially when there is a clock change, which leads to AmbiguousTimeError. The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous times on clock change days.

4. To fix the bug, possible approaches include properly handling ambiguous times that occur due to a clock change, ensuring that time bins are created accurately, and addressing the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue. This may involve adjusting how time bins are created and labeled, especially when ambiguous times occur.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_localize(None)  # Remove timezone to avoid AmbiguousTimeError

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, a modification was made to remove the timezone from the `ax` variable to avoid the AmbiguousTimeError. Additionally, the creation of time bins and labels has been adjusted to address the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue. This corrected code aims to resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue related to handling daily frequency data with a clock change.
