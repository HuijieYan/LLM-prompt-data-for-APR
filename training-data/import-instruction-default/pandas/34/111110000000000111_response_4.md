1. The buggy function is a method called `_get_time_bins` within the class `TimeGrouper`. This class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping, and the buggy function is responsible for getting the time bins based on the input axis.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely associated with the handling of ambiguous timestamps, as indicated by the GitHub issue description. The function includes logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins based on the input axis, which may not be handling the ambiguity correctly.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, specifically on clock change days in locations such as Cuba. The `TimeGrouper` class is not correctly handling these ambiguous timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using the `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency in certain time zone contexts.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Review the logic for adjusting bin edges and generating bins within the `_get_time_bins` function to properly handle ambiguous timestamps, taking into account the time zone context.
   b. Consider utilizing appropriate date handling functions provided by the `pandas` library to address the issues related to ambiguous timestamps on clock change days.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Corrected logic for handling ambiguous timestamps and generating bins
    binner = ax.asfreq(self.freq, method='bfill')  # Adjust for ambiguous timestamps
    labels = binner

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Generating bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code includes adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamps using the `asfreq` method and ensures proper handling of labels and bins. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
