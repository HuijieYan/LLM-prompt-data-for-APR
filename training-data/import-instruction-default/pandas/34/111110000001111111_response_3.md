The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation for the `first` and `last` bin, which is affected by the timezone and the handling of ambiguous timestamps.

The bug's cause is due to the function not properly handling ambiguous timezones and not accounting for the clock change during the day, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for the potential ambiguity in the timestamp and properly generate bins and labels for the time intervals.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    """
    Custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : pandas date offset or offset alias for identifying bin edges
    closed : closed end of interval; 'left' or 'right'
    label : interval boundary to use for labeling; 'left' or 'right'
    convention : {'start', 'end', 'e', 's'}
        If axis is PeriodIndex
    """

    def _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = ax[0].floor('D')
        last = ax[-1].ceil('D')

        if self.closed == 'right':
            last = last + pd.Timedelta(days=1)

        labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed,
        )

        bins = labels

        return bins, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the ambiguous time issue by adjusting the `first` and `last` bins based on the floor and ceiling of the first and last timestamps in the index. Additionally, it also accounts for the `closed` parameter to avoid any potential issues related to ambiguous timestamps and clock changes.
