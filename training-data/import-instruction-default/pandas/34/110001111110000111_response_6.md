The bug is caused by the function _get_time_bins in the pandas/core/resample.py file. This function is used to calculate time bins for the groupby operation, and it is failing when handling the AmbiguousTimeError caused by a long clock-change day in Cuba.

The failing test test_downsample_dst_at_midnight sets up a DataFrame with hourly frequency and then tries to group it by daily frequency using pd.Grouper. However, when the DataFrame contains time indexes with ambiguous timestamp data due to a clock change, the _get_time_bins function fails to handle it and raises the AmbiguousTimeError.

The GitHub issue provides further context, describing the expected behavior and the observed problem. The expectation is that the call to groupby should return three groups for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November) and that the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00', containing the 25 hourly data points for that day.

To fix the bug, the _get_time_bins function needs to be modified to handle AmbiguousTimeError caused by the clock change day in a better way. It will likely involve handling the ambiguous time using the tz_localize and tz_convert methods more explicitly, and ensuring that pandas' functionality correctly handles timezones and ambiguous time.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function _get_time_bins:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().tz_localize(ax.tz)  # handle ambiguous time explicitly
    last = ax.max().tz_localize(ax.tz)   # handle ambiguous time explicitly
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this corrected function, the groupby operation in the failing test should now handle the AmbiguousTimeError correctly and return the expected output.

This fix addresses the specific issue described in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue. It handles ambiguous time explicitly using tz_localize, ensuring that the groupby operation correctly handles timezones and ambiguous time.
