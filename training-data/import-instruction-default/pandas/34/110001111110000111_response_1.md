1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is supposed to handle time binning for a given DatetimeIndex. It calls several related functions to calculate the time bins and labels, ultimately returning the calculated bins, labels, and binner.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function. This calculation does not handle ambiguous times properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError in the failing test.

3. 
   (a) The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is failing to handle ambiguous times properly when calculating the time bins and labels.
   (b) The related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` are called in the process of calculating the bins and labels.
   (c) The failing test is attempting to downsample a DataFrame using groupby with a PD Grouper frequency of 1 day, and it is failing with an AmbiguousTimeError. The error message mentions that it cannot infer the DST time from a specific timestamp.
   (d) The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, explaining that the call to groupby should return three groups, but it raises an AmbiguousTimeError instead.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous times properly within the `_get_time_bins` function, possibly by using a different method to calculate the bins and labels that accounts for ambiguous times.
   - Updating the `date_range` function parameters to handle ambiguous times appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Fix handling of ambiguous times
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code should handle ambiguous times properly and pass the failing test while resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
