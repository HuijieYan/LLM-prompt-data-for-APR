In the given buggy function `_get_time_bins`, the issue seems to be related to the way the `binner` and `labels` are being created. Since the failing test is related to a specific time zone (America/Havana) and a long clock-change day, the problem is likely in the calculation or handling of time edges and daylight saving transitions during the binning process.

The failing test indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised due to the inability to infer DST time from a particular timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba (which is expected behavior if timezones with DST transitions are not handled correctly).

The GitHub issue also provides details about the expected output and the problem encountered.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the construction of `binner` and `labels` properly handles the transitions caused by the ambiguous timestamps.

A possible approach for fixing the bug includes revising the time edge calculation and handling in the `date_range` function to account for ambiguous times and daylight saving transitions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor('D')
    last = ax[-1].ceil('D') + self.freq

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        closed=self.closed,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner.copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected version of the function accounts for the ambiguity associated with DST transitions and ensures that the `date_range` function constructs the time edges properly. This should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError raised in the failing test.
