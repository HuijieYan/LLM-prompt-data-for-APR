The bug in the given function appears to be in the calculation of bin_edges and the subsequent generation of bins. The issue seems to be occurring due to incorrect binning and label assignments in the returned variables. This could be due to a mismatch in the length of bins and labels. Additionally, the tz parameter when creating the binner and labels from date_range might not be correctly applied. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the bin_edges are calculated correctly and that the labels are assigned in such a way that they match the bins. Additionally, we need to ensure that the timezone information is appropriately handled when creating the binner and labels.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other class members)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz, 
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed,
        )
        
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax.asi8)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        labels = binner[1:].copy()
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels.append(pd.DatetimeIndex([last], tz=ax.tz))

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[:len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code:
1. We ensure that the bin_edges are correctly calculated using the _adjust_bin_edges method.
2. We create the binner from date_range with appropriate timezone information.
3. We ensure that the labels are assigned and adjusted to match the bins.
4. We handle the case where labels are slightly longer than the bins.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and provide the expected output based on the provided input parameter values.
