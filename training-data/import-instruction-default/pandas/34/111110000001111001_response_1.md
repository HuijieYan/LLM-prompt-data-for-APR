The potential error in the buggy function is likely to be in the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins`. The function seems to be generating incorrect bin edges and bins based on the input data, which is resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` needs to be revised to ensure that the correct bins are generated based on the input data.

Additionally, it seems that the generation of `labels` is incorrect based on the condition for `self.closed` and `self.label`. This needs to be adjusted to ensure the correct labels are assigned.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other parts of the class)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )

        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            closed=self.closed,
            label=self.label,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of `bin_edges` and `bins` has been adjusted to ensure that the correct bins are generated based on the input data. Additionally, the generation of `labels` has been revised to correctly assign the labels based on the conditions for `self.closed` and `self.label`.
