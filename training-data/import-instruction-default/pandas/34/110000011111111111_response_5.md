The issue in the `_get_time_bins` function is caused by the incorrect generation of `binner` and `labels` due to handling of ambiguous times in the presence of daylight saving time. This results in incorrect binning and labeling of the data, causing the subsequent failure in the test case provided.

To address this issue, the code should handle the ambiguous time error that occurs while working with localized times on the clock change day in Havana. Ensuring that ambiguously localized times are handled correctly is the key to resolving this bug.

To attempt to fix the bug, the corrected function `_get_time_bins` is presented below:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax[0].floor("D")
    last = ax[-1].ceil("D") - Period(1, "D")

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right" and len(labels):
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right" and len(labels):
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the ambiguity on clock change days and address the issues experienced with the failing test case.

With this corrected function in place, the failing test case should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should also be resolved.
