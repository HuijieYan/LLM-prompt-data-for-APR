# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba
```

## The GitHub issue's detailed description
```text
Code Sample
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
start = datetime(2018, 11, 3, 12)
end = datetime(2018, 11, 5, 12)
index = pd.date_range(start, end, freq="1H")
index = index.tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert('America/Havana')
data = list(range(len(index)))
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)
groups = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='1D'))

Problem description
On a long clock-change day in Cuba, e.g 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. pd.Grouper does not handle this as I expect. More precisely the call to groupby in the code above raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

This issue is of a similar nature to #23742 but it seems #23742 was fixed in 0.24 whereas this was not.

Expected Output
The call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of november). The group for the 4th of november should be labelled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (that is the first midnight, before the clock change) and it should contain the 25 hourly data points for this day.
