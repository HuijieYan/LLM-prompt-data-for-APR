1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class and is used to generate time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`. The issue with this function is related to handling ambiguous times on clock change days. The issue has been reported on GitHub, and it seems that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps properly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the generation of time bins using `date_range`. It seems that the time bins are not being handled correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change days.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins for a given `DatetimeIndex`.
   (b). The `TimeGrouper` class contains this function and is used for grouping data by time intervals.
   (c). The function `_adjust_bin_edges` is called within `_get_time_bins` to adjust the bin edges, and `date_range` is used to generate the time bins.
   (d). The GitHub issue information states that the issue arises on a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps properly, especially on clock change days.
   - Ensuring that the time bins are generated correctly and labeled according to the local time, handling any shifts due to daylight saving time changes.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `get_time_bins`:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        # handle ambiguous timestamps
        binner = binner.tz_localize(None).tz_localize(ax.tz, ambiguous="NaT")
            
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

The corrected code handles ambiguous timestamps on clock change days by using the `ambiguous="infer"` and `ambiguous="NaT"` options in generating and adjusting the time bins. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
