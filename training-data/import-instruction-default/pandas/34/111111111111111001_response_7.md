The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to create a dataframe and perform a resample operation using `groupby` with a frequency of `1D`. The test fails with an `AmbiguousTimeError` from Pytz when it encounters repeated times due to Daylight Savings Time (DST) changes. There is an issue with the bin edge computations inside the method `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class, which leads to the creation of ambiguous time labels.

The problematic location in the function seems to be the generation of bin edges for the labels using `date_range`. The function needs to account for DST changes when generating the bins and labels, to avoid ambiguous time errors.

To fix this, we can adjust the generation of `binner` and `labels` to account for potential duplicate times. This can be done by considering the ambiguous and nonexistent options for handling such situations.

Additionally, it might be necessary to modify the `bins` and `labels` generation section to make sure that the labels and bins are aligned.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` method that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Ensure that labels and bins are aligned
    labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected version includes the modification to the generation of `binner` and `labels` to account for repeated times, by adding the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` arguments to specify the behavior when ambiguous times are encountered. Additionally, the alignment of labels and bins has been enforced.

With these adjustments, the `_get_time_bins` method should now handle DST changes properly and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring, thus passing the failing test.
