1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of a custom `TimeGrouper` class that extends the `Grouper` class. The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` calls the `groupby` method with a `pd.Grouper` that contains the `freq` parameter set to "1D", which triggers the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message indicates that a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` is raised, suggesting an issue with handling daylight savings time transitions.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is the `date_range` call, which is used to create the time bins for the resampling operation. The provided error message suggests that the method used to create the date range is not handling ambiguous time transitions correctly.

3. The bug's cause is related to the creation of time bins using the `date_range` method, which fails to account for ambiguous time transitions in daylight savings time. The failing test triggers this bug when attempting to resample data with a frequency of "1D" across an ambiguous time transition, resulting in the `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use a different method to create the time bins that accounts for daylight savings time transitions. This can involve utilizing a different function to create the time bins or modifying the existing method to handle ambiguous time transitions appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = ax.to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp(self.freq, how=self.closed)
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Please note that the above corrected code modifies the way `binner` and `labels` are created to handle ambiguous time transitions correctly. This should fix the bug and allow the provided failing test to pass.
