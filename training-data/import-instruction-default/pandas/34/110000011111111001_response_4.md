The potential error in the problematic function is related to the handling of date ranges and timezones, leading to an error when attempting to group the data by day. The issue appears to stem from how the `date_range` function is used to define the time bins and labels.

The failing test and error message indicate that the time bins and labels are incorrectly handling the transition from standard time to daylight saving time, leading to ambiguous time errors. This occurs because the date range creation does not account for the timezone transition in the given period, leading to ambiguity.

To fix this bug, one approach is to use the `infer_time_rule_for_period` method from the `DatetimeIndex` class to automatically and accurately infer the time rules for the specified period in the given timezone. By using this method, the correct time bins and labels can be generated without ambiguity.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    period = ax.inferred_freq
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=ax[0], end=ax[-1], freq=period, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function uses the `inferred_freq` method of the `DatetimeIndex` class instead of manually defining the period. This ensures that the time bins and labels are correctly derived, considering the period in the specified timezone, and should resolve the ambiguity issue encountered in the failing test.
