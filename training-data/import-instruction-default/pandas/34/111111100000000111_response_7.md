1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a part of the `TimeGrouper` class in the file `pandas/core/resample.py`. It is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping and is associated with the related functions `_adjust_bin_edges`, `ax` and `_get_timestamp_range_edges`. The GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba" is related to this buggy function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely in the section where it constructs the bins and labels using the `date_range` function. This section attempts to handle ambiguous timestamps and may be causing the issue related to the time change in Cuba.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to how the function `_get_time_bins` constructs the bins and labels for the time grouping. It seems to be failing to handle the ambiguous timestamp created by the time change in Cuba, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a) Ensuring that the date range construction takes into account the ambiguous timestamp by using the appropriate timezone handling.
   (b) Checking if the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters in the `date_range` function are correctly set to handle the ambiguous timestamp.
   (c) Investigating if there are any specific handling requirements for the time change in Cuba that need to be accounted for.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Use tz handling to account for ambiguous timestamps
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

This corrected version of the function should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and handle the ambiguous timestamps caused by the time change in Cuba.
