The issue stems from the fact that the `labels` and `binner` arrays are being assigned to `date_range()` with the same start and end values. Additionally, on clock change day in Cuba, the time in UTC is not unique and is ambiguous due to daylight savings time. This is causing the inconsistent behavior in the `labels` and `binner` arrays, leading to the buggy behavior and the reported error in the GitHub issue.

To address this, we need to modify the function to account for the ambiguous time caused by the clock change in Cuba. This can be done by adjusting the `date_range()` calls for both `labels` and `binner` arrays to handle the ambiguous time explicitly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    start = first.tz_localize(None)  # Ensure start and end are naive timestamps
    end = last.tz_localize(None)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=start,
        end=end,
        tz=None,  # Naive timestamps to handle ambiguous time
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values_utc = ax.tz_convert("UTC").asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values_utc)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values_utc, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling the ambiguous time on the clock change day in Cuba and ensuring that start and end are naive timestamps when creating the `binner` array, this corrected function should resolve the issue and behave consistently as expected.
