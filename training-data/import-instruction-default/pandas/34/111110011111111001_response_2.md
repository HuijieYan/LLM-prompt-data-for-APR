The bug in the code seems to be related to daylight saving time transitions, as indicated by the error message from the failing test.

### Bug Location
The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the `last` variable in the `_get_time_bins` function. The `last` variable is calculated using `_get_timestamp_range_edges` with the `ax.max()` value. This calculation may be influenced by the transition between daylight saving time and standard time, resulting in an ambiguous time error when creating the date range.

### Bug Cause
The issue is caused by the calculation of `last` that might result in an ambiguous time when transitioning from daylight saving time to standard time. This leads to an ambiguous time error when creating the date range, as explained in the error message.

### Possible approaches for fixing the bug
To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle the daylight saving time transition when creating the date range. We can use the `tz_convert` function to ensure that the `last` timestamp is in the desired time zone and does not lead to an ambiguous time error.

### Corrected code
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        # Ensure that the `last` timestamp is in the desired time zone
        last = ax.tz_convert(self.freq)
        last = last + 1  # Increment by 1 to avoid ambiguity during transition
        first = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first,
            end=last,
            freq=self.freq,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```

By handling the transition between daylight saving time and standard time, the corrected code should be able to create the date range without causing an ambiguous time error. This should allow the function to pass the failing test and resolve the bug.
