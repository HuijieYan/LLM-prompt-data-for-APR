1. The buggy function is a method called `_get_time_bins` within the class `TimeGrouper`. This class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The GitHub issue pertains to a problem with the grouping when there is an ambiguous timestamp, particularly on a clock-change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps, which is causing the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `_get_time_bins` function, which is preventing proper grouping when there is an ambiguous timestamp, especially on a clock-change day. This has led to the AmbiguousTimeError reported in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Implementing a mechanism to properly handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock-change days.
   - Ensuring that the labels and bins are generated accurately and in accordance with the proper time zones.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    """
    Custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : pandas date offset or offset alias for identifying bin edges
    closed : closed end of interval; 'left' or 'right'
    label : interval boundary to use for labeling; 'left' or 'right'
    convention : {'start', 'end', 'e', 's'}
        If axis is PeriodIndex
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function replacing the buggy version
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max() + Period(n=1, freq=self.freq),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function aims to properly handle ambiguous timestamps, especially on clock-change days, by using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
