The bug in the code seems to be related to the way datetimes are being converted and handled. The error message specifically mentions an "AmbiguousTimeError" and states that it cannot infer dst time from a specific date. The error is caused by the conversion of datetimes to a different timezone and the occurrence of repeated times. 

One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the way datetimes are being handled and converted within the `_get_time_bins` function. This may involve adjusting the handling of timezone localization and also how the axes are being generated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that attempts to fix the bug:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first = ax[0].replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        last = ax[-1] + self.freq

        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = binner.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if bins[-1] == len(binner):
            bins = bins[:-1]

        return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `first` and `last` is adjusted, and the usage of date_range is also modified to prevent the occurrence of repeated times and to handle the timezone localization more accurately.

By using this corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function, the bug is expected to be fixed, and the failing test should pass, satisfying the expected input/output variables.
