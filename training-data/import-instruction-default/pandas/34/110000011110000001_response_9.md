The problematic function "_get_time_bins" takes an axis (ax) and checks if it is a DatetimeIndex. If not, it raises a TypeError. Then, it checks if the length of the axis is zero. If it is, it returns an empty DatetimeIndex. Otherwise, it proceeds with further processing to generate bins, bin edges, and labels based on the frequency.

The failing test "test_downsample_dst_at_midnight" is attempting to group a DataFrame based on day frequency using a Grouper. The test input includes a datatime index with both UTC and "America/Havana" time zones. During the execution, an error is raised, specifically a pytz.AmbiguousTimeError, which states that it cannot infer the daylight saving time.

The potential error in the "_get_time_bins" function is the creation of bin labels using the `date_range` method, which is causing an issue with inferring daylight saving time.

The bug's cause is in the way the bin labels are being created using `date_range`. The error message suggests that there are no repeated times making the daylight saving time ambiguous. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the timezone conversion and daylight saving time.

To fix this bug, we can adjust the way bin labels are generated, ensuring that the timezone information and daylight saving time are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name, tz=ax.tz)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # Use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    bin_edges = binner.values

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
