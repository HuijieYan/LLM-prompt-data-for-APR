The issue is related to handling daylight saving time (DST) changes in a specific timezone. The failing test is attempting to group data by day, and it fails with an AmbiguousTimeError when it encounters midnight of the DST transition day in Cuba.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of time bins for the grouping operation. The error message indicates that an AmbiguousTimeError is raised during the grouping operation, specifically when creating the date range at midnight on the transition day.

The GitHub issue details that on the clock-change day in Cuba, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and the pd.Grouper does not handle this as expected. The expected output is that the call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of November), and the group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the hourly data points for that day.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to handle the ambiguous time explicitly by adjusting the time bins on the transition day when creating the date range.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Create the date range with explicit handling for ambiguous time on the transition day
    if ax.tz and ax.tz._is_dst(first):
        first += -pd.Timedelta('1H')
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This fix includes explicit handling for the ambiguous time on the transition day by adjusting the start time of the date range when the timezone is detected to be in DST at the start time. With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test and successfully address the issue described in the GitHub report.
