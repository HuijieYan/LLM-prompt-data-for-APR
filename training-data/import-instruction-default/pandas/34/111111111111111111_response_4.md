The issue arises because the frequency being used to generate the date range is 'D', which uses midnight as its reference point; however, on the day of the clock change in Cuba, there's an ambiguous time at midnight which is not correctly handled by the code. 

The problem seems to be within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. This method generates time bins based on the given frequency and adjusts them based on the input data. However, in cases where the transition to daylight saving time (DST) happens, the code is not handling the situation correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle the ambiguous time. When creating the date range for the bins, we can use the `ambiguous` and `nonexistent` parameters to handle ambiguous and nonexistent times. Additionally, we can explicitly set the `utc` parameter to `False` to avoid converting ambiguous times to UTC. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # use `start` and `end` instead of directly using `first` and `last`
    start = Timestamp(first)
    end = Timestamp(last)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start, 
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        utc=False  # explicitly handle ambiguous times
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By explicitly handling the ambiguous times and avoiding conversion to UTC, the corrected code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket. This fix should account for the ambiguous time at midnight during the transition to DST in the given timezone.
