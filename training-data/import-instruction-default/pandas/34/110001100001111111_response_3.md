The problem occurs due to the incorrect handling of the clock change on November 4th in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The issue arises because the `date_range` function does not correctly handle the transition when generating the time bins and labels.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function should be used with the parameter `ambiguous=None` to handle ambiguous times explicitly. In addition, the label on the 4th of November needs to be correctly assigned. The bug will be resolved by ensuring that the start and end times are calculated correctly, accounting for ambiguous times. Furthermore, the adjustment of the bins for time groupers should also be handled carefully to avoid any discrepancies, especially during ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=None,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code is designed to handle ambiguous times explicitly by using the `ambiguous=None` parameter in the `date_range` function. This will ensure that the labels for time groups are assigned correctly and accurately reflect the time periods. Additionally, the start and end times are calculated based on the input `ax` to accurately handle transitions and avoid the AmbiguousTimeError that was reported in the GitHub issue.
