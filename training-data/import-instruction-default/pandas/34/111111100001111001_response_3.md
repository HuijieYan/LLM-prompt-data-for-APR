The bug in the function seems to be caused by incorrect binning of timestamps and labels due to the incorrect generation of bin edges. This leads to the discrepancy between the expected and actual output variable values.

To fix the bug, we can generate bin edges using the `bin_edges` and `first` and `last` timestamps as start and end points, respectively. We can then use these bin edges to generate the bins and labels. Additionally, we need to account for the `closed` attribute when generating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    """
    Custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
    ...
    """

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        first, last = ax[0], ax[-1]
        bin_edges = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=self.closed, tz=ax.tz)

        bins = np.searchsorted(bin_edges, ax, side=self.closed)
        labels = bin_edges.take(bins - 1)

        return bin_edges, bins, labels
```

The corrected code addresses the issue by generating bin edges using the `date_range` function based on the first and last timestamps in the input `ax`. Then, the `np.searchsorted` function is used to generate the bins and labels based on the bin edges and the `closed` attribute.

This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the bug.
