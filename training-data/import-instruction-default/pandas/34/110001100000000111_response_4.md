The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the larger issue regarding `pd.Grouper` failing with an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba. The issue arises when local time is ambiguous, such as during a clock change day.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line that calculates the first and last timestamps:
```python
first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
```
This is likely where the ambiguity in time is not being handled correctly, leading to the error.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function, `_get_time_bins`, is responsible for calculating time bins by processing the input datetime index.
(b). The related functions are responsible for handling datetime operations and adjusting bin edges.
(c). The GitHub Issue information indicates that the bug occurs specifically on clock change days in Cuba, where ambiguous time causes an error when using `pd.Grouper`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Handling ambiguous time explicitly, ensuring that the date range calculation accounts for potential ambiguous timestamps.
2. Adjusting the bin edges and labels to accommodate potential ambiguity in time.
3. Implementing a workaround to address the specific issue with clock change days in Cuba.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected function should handle the ambiguity in time and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
