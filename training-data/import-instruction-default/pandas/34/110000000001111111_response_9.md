The bug in the given function is likely related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating bins for grouping data using the `TimeGrouper`. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem: on long clock-change days in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, and this is not being handled correctly by the `pd.Grouper` function, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The `TimeGrouper` function `_get_time_bins` is likely where the error occurs, as it is responsible for setting the bins and labels for grouping the data. The discrepancy between the expected and actual output values is related to the handling of ambiguous time and the frequency setting for the bins. The GitHub issue explains that the call to `groupby` should return three groups â€“ one for each day (3rd, 4th, and 5th of November). The group for the 4th of November should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and contain the hourly data points for that day.

To resolve this issue, it's necessary to modify the way the bins are created and labeled, ensuring that ambiguous timestamps are handled correctly and that the bins cover the entire time range as expected.

The corrected code for the function `_get_time_bins` is as follows:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected function takes into account the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue and properly handles ambiguous timestamps and frequency settings. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and ensure that the grouping works as expected on long clock-change days in Cuba.
