The problem is occurring when there is an ambiguous timestamp due to the clock change in Cuba. This issue is related to the conversion of timezones and handling of ambiguous timestamps.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the `date_range` function is used to generate `binner` and `labels` using the `first` and `last` timestamps.

The expected output is the correct grouping of data with three groups, one for each day, and correct labeling for the group on the day of the clock change. The actual output is an AmbiguousTimeError due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps.

The bug's cause is related to the incorrect generation of `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function when there are ambiguous timestamps.

To fix the bug, the `date_range` function should be replaced with a custom function that handles the ambiguous timestamps correctly. This custom function should take into account the timezone, daylight saving time, and the behavior of the clock change.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min().to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()  # Convert first timestamp to period and then to timestamp
    last = ax.max().to_period(self.freq).to_timestamp()  # Convert last timestamp to period and then to timestamp

    binner = labels = date_range_ambiguous(
        start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, freq=self.freq, name=ax.name
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the original code remains unchanged

    return binner, bins, labels
```

The custom `date_range_ambiguous` function should handle the ambiguity caused by the clock change in Cuba and generate the `binner` and `labels` accordingly. The rest of the function can remain unchanged. This fix should resolve the AmbiguousTimeError and provide the expected grouping of data as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
