1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is trying to group the data based on time bins, which is causing an issue with daylight savings time adjustment. This is causing the test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` to fail with an `AmbiguousTimeError` at '2018-11-04 00:00:00'. The function is calculating the bins and labels incorrectly, which causes this fatal error during the time group splitting operation.

2. The potential error location is within the logic of calculating the bins and labels. This logic is flawed and is causing the issue with daylight savings time adjustment.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The `_get_time_bins` function is trying to calculate bins and labels based on the given time frequency, but it is not handling the daylight savings time adjustment correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.
   (b). The related functions `ax`, `_adjust_bin_edges`, and `_get_timestamp_range_edges` are not directly related to this issue.
   (c). The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` attempts to downsample data over two days and calculate the mean value, but encounters an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the flawed logic in the `_get_time_bins` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Use proper methods from the `pandas` library that handle time series data and daylight savings time adjustments correctly.
   (b). Ensure that bins and labels are calculated taking into account the potential ambiguity in time due to daylight savings time changes.
   (c). Avoid using directly calculated time range and prefer using built-in methods to handle time series data with daylight savings time adjustments.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner = ax.floor(self.freq)
    labels = []
    bins = []
    for i in range(len(binner)):
        start = binner[i]
        end = start + self.freq
        labels.append(start)
        bins.append(ax[(ax >= start) & (ax < end)].values)

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code first floors the timestamps to the nearest frequency. Then, it iterates over the floored timestamps to find the bins and labels correctly, handling possible daylight savings time ambiguity. This implementation uses built-in `pandas` methods to handle time series data effectively.
