1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` takes a datetime index `ax`, and some other parameters as input and processes it to create the binner, bins, and labels for the resampling operation. It's related to the failing test since it is within the call stack of the failing test.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `date_range` function where the frequency and ambiguous time handling might not be set correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when the failing test is executed.

3. The issue is caused by a shift in the clock on the date '2018-11-04' causing midnight to be ambiguous. The failing test attempts to group data based on a daily frequency, but the buggy function fails to handle ambiguous time situations correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the `date_range` function handles ambiguous times correctly for the given time zone.
   b. Adjust the code to account for clock changes and ambiguous times during time binning operations.
   c. And address any other discrepancies with the time handling to ensure that ambiguous times are resolved appropriately to avoid errors.

5. Here's the corrected function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        closed=self.closed,  # Includes handling for closed
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handling ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner if self.label == "right" else binner[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):  # Adjust labels if needed
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
With these adjustments, the corrected function should handle the ambiguous time correctly and pass the failing test.
