The bug in the function `_get_time_bins` seems to be in the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` variables using the `date_range` function. It appears that the `start` and `end` parameters are not being correctly calculated.

The failing test indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` which suggests that there are overlapping times during the shift from DST to standard time, and this is likely related to the use of `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods to change the time zone.

To resolve this issue, the `date_range` function should be adjusted to handle the transition from DST to standard time properly.

Corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Calculate the beginning and end of the date range with respect to the time zone
    start = ax[0]
    end = ax[-1].tz_convert(start.tz)

    first = Timestamp(start.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0))
    last = Timestamp(end.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0))

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    # ... (existing code)
```

The `start` and `end` variables are calculated directly based on the input `ax`, ensuring that the date range is properly adjusted for the time zone. This should resolve the issue with the ambiguous time error and correctly handle the transition from DST to standard time.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and handle the edge cases properly.
