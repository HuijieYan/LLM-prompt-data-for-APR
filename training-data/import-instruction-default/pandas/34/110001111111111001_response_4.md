The bug stems from the incorrect calculation of certain boundary values for the date range that doesn't account for the daylight saving time (DST) change, leading to an ambiguous time error. Additionally, the 'end' time considered in the date_range calculation - 'last' - does not accurately reflect the actual time based on the input 'ax' that shifted from -04:00 to -05:00 without accounting for the time shift during the DST change.

To fix the bug in the `_get_time_bins` function, we need to ensure accurate handling of datetime representations, accounting for daylight saving time changes, and properly adjusting the 'last' time based on timezone information. We can implement the fix by using specialized timezone conversion methods such as `tz_convert` and `localize`, and ensuring proper handling of time zone offset changes.

Here's the corrected and modified version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    start = ax[0].tz_convert(None).floor('D').tz_localize(self.ax.tz)
    end = ax[-1].tz_convert(None).ceil('D').tz_localize(self.ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected function:
1. We utilize the `tz_convert` and `tz_localize` methods to handle time zone conversions and changes due to daylight saving time.
2. The `start` and `end` values are calculated based on the input 'ax' to accurately reflect the boundary of the date range while considering any timezone offsets and DST changes.
3. These adjustments ensure that the date range is calculated accurately and accounts for potential DST-related time shifts, thus addressing the ambiguous time error encountered in the failing test.

This revised function should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
