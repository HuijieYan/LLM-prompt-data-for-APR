1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to generate time bins for resampling, but it does not handle ambiguous time correctly, resulting in the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` with daily frequency on clock change day in Cuba. The relationship between the function, the failing test, and the GitHub issue is that the failing test is a specific case that triggers the AmbiguousTimeError, and the GitHub issue provides the expected behavior and detailed information about the problem.

2. The error is likely to be related to the handling of ambiguous time when generating time bins in the `_get_time_bins` function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle ambiguous time correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The related functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges` don't seem to be directly related to the cause. The failing test provides a specific case that triggers the error, and the error message `AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time` gives us the insight that the function does not handle ambiguous time correctly. The GitHub issue further explains the expected behavior and the specific scenario in which the bug occurs.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous time correctly when generating time bins. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function properly accounts for ambiguous times, especially around the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function with the fix included:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Handle ambiguous time by specifying the ambiguous and nonexistent parameters
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With this fix in place, the function should properly handle ambiguous time and pass the failing test. It also addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
