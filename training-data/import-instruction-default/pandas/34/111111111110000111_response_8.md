The issue here is related to handling ambiguous time in the date range which leads to a pytz AmbiguousTimeError. The failing test is trying to group the data by days, and during the clock change in Cuba, midnight local time becomes ambiguous. This is what's causing the AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug is located in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, where the `date_range` function is called with tz related parameters. This does not handle the ambiguous time from the date range, leading to the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `date_range` function does not handle ambiguous time correctly when generating the bins for grouping.

To fix this issue, the `date_range` should be called in a way that it correctly handles ambiguous times and returns the expected result without raising an AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:
```python
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
    
        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,  # retain the timezone information
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",  # handle ambiguous times
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
    
        # if we end up with more labels than bins
        # adjust the labels
        # GH4076
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
    
        return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code specifically addresses the handling of ambiguous time by using the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter in the `date_range` function. This ensures that ambiguous times are correctly handled when generating the bins for grouping.

With this corrected code, the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` should pass without raising an AmbiguousTimeError. It also resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug description related to the handling of clock change days in Cuba.
