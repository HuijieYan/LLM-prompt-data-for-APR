The potential error location is in the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically in the date_range call. The issue is caused by a clock change-related AmbiguousTimeError that occurs on days with a time transition, such as the long clock-change day in Cuba, when the time falls back.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the clock change and ambiguous time correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `TimeGrouper`:

```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )

        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first = Period(ax.min(), freq=self.freq)
        last = Period(ax.max(), freq=self.freq)

        closed = "left" if self.closed == "left" else "right"
        labels = PeriodIndex(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=closed)

        binner = PeriodIndex(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, closed=closed)

        return binner, [], labels
```

This code sets `first` and `last` as Period objects and then constructs the `labels` and `binner` using PeriodIndex objects, ensuring that any ambiguous times during a clock change are handled correctly.

This code should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
