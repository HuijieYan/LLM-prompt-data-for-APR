The buggy function is part of a larger class that deals with time resampling and is used to retrieve time bins for resampling a time series.

The failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a DataFrame by grouping data with a frequency of 1 day, applied to a DatetimeIndex. The test then checks for equality between the result and the expected output.

The error occurs when the DataFrame is grouped using `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`. The error message indicates that a specific time is ambiguous due to daylight saving time, and as a result, the resampling operation fails.

The bug appears to be in the `_get_time_bins` function. When generating time bins using the `date_range` function, the problematic code does not handle the ambiguous time index correctly, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`. In particular, the `tz` parameter in the `date_range` function call needs to be handled more carefully to avoid ambiguous or non-existent times, especially during daylight saving time changes.

To fix this bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be more robust in handling the time index and considering the possibility of ambiguous and non-existent times during time resampling. This can be done by ensuring proper timezone handling and addressing any daylight saving time-related ambiguities.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that takes into account the issues related to ambiguous and non-existent times during resampling:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
    
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT", nonexistent="NaT"
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(self.freq, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the corrected `_get_time_bins` function should handle ambiguous time in the `date_range` properly and ensure that resampling operations do not fail due to ambiguous time issues. This corrected function should pass the failing test scenario.
