## Issue Analysis
### The buggy function
The `TimeGrouper` class contains the buggy function `_get_time_bins`. This function is responsible for creating time bins based on the input `DatetimeIndex` which is then used for grouping the data.

### The failing test
The failing test is testing the behavior of the `groupby` function with a specific time zone conversion, and it is raising an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to issues with clock changes and midnight time in the timezone. The failing test indicates that the grouping is not taking into account the ambiguity of certain timestamps.

### Error message
The error message states that it cannot infer daylight saving time from a specific timestamp due to it being ambiguous. This error is caused by the groupby operation that is involved in the buggy function.

### Expected Output
The expected output is for the call to `groupby` to return three groups, one for each day, with the group for the ambiguous day labeled correctly and containing the data for that day.

### GitHub issue
The GitHub issue provides additional context to the problem, explaining that the bug is related to how Pandas handles ambiguous time during clock changes in specific time zones.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_get_time_bins` function, where the time bins are being calculated without taking into account the ambiguity of timestamps during a clock change.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_get_time_bins` function not handling ambiguous timestamps appropriately in the given timezone, leading to an incorrect grouping operation.

## Possible Approaches
1. Adjust the bin generation to account for ambiguous times during clock changes in the given time zone.
2. Use a different method for generating bins that considers the specific behavior of the time zone and its daylight saving time transitions.

## Corrected Code
```python
class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    # ... (other functions)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
    
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        tz = ax.tz
        result = ax.tz_localize(None, ambiguous='NaT')
        first, last = ax[result.values[0]], ax[result.values[-1]]
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=tz, name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward"
        )
    
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
    
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
            ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
        )
    
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

I have modified the `_get_time_bins` function to correctly handle ambiguous times during clock changes by localizing the time index with the "NaT" ambiguous value and then using the localized endpoints for generating the time bins. This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
