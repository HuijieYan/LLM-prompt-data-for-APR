1. The buggy function is a method called `_get_time_bins` within the `TimeGrouper` class. This function is related to a GitHub issue where using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D')` on a datetime index raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` on clock change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely when creating the `binner` and `labels` using the `date_range` function, as this does not handle the ambiguous timestamps correctly.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function, which leads to the `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper`. The GitHub issue provides the code sample, problem description, and expected output, which highlights the specific scenario that leads to the error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include implementing a custom solution for handling ambiguous timestamps in the `date_range` function, ensuring that the `pd.Grouper` correctly handles timezone changes and ambiguous times, and updating the logic within the `_get_time_bins` function to account for the specific scenario described in the GitHub issue.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, which resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(ax)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax.asi8, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner
    if self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
