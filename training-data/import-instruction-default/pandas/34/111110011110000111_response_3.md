Based on the buggy code, failing test, error message, and GitHub issue, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps on clock change days in Cuba. The error message indicates an AmbiguousTimeError, which is consistent with the GitHub issue's description of the problem.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_get_time_bins` function, specifically the handling of timestamps on clock change days.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError when trying to group data on such days.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps, ensuring that the grouping operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError. This may involve adjusting the way timestamps are processed and labeled on clock change days.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )
    
    labels = binner
    if self.closed == "right" and self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function includes adjustments to handle ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, ensuring that the groupby operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

This corrected code should be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, and it should pass the failing test while also resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
