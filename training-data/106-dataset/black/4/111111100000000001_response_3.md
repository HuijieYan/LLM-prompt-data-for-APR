Error:
The bug is in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. It seems to be trying to use `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` without initializing them.

Reason:
The buggy code is trying to use `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` without initializing them. This is causing the error.

Approach:
1. Initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` to a default value or to None in the `__init__` method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. Update the `maybe_empty_lines` method to handle the case when `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` are not initialized.

Corrected code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_4/black.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function
@dataclass
