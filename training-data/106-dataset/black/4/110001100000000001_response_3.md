The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to call a private method `_maybe_empty_lines` with `self._maybe_empty_lines()`, but the actual definition of the method is as follows: `_maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:`. There is also inconsistency in the method name - one starts with an underscore, and one doesn't.

To fix this issue, we need to correct the function signature, remove the redundant method definition, and adjust the calling of the method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the redundant method definition, fixed the method name, and called the private method `_maybe_empty_lines` with the correct syntax.
