The issue seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in the code formatter, specifically on the second pass. The bug is likely occurring in the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the code, where it calculates the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line. It appears that the calculation may not be handling the previous empty lines properly, resulting in incorrect values for `before`.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `before` variable in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. Specifically, we need to take into account the previous value of `before` and calculate it based on the current value as well.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    if self.previous_line:
        before += self.previous_line.count('\n') - 1
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we're adding the number of empty lines from the `previous_line` to the `before` variable, which should account for any previous empty lines properly. This way, we ensure that the correct number of extra empty lines before the current line is calculated.
