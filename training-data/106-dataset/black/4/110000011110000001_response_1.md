The error message is indicating that the function `assertFormatEqual` is failing because the expected and actual outputs are not matching. The test case is expecting two empty lines before the `print` statement, but the actual output only contains one empty line.

The potential error in the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the line `before -= self.previous_after`. It seems that `self.previous_after` is not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the bug is that the `previous_after` attribute is not being properly initialized, so when subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`, it is likely causing the unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to properly initialize the `self.previous_after` attribute when the class is initialized.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0  # Initialize previous_after attribute
        self.previous_line = None  # Initialize previous_line attribute

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
