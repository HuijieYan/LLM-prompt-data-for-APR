The test case "test_beginning_backslash" is failing because the expected output is 'print("hello, world")\n' while the actual output is '\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'. This indicates that the function `maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the number of extra empty lines before the current line correctly.

The issue lies in the calculation of the `before` value in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The `before` value is supposed to be decreased by `self.previous_after`, but it seems that this calculation is not working as expected.

The bug is occurring because the subtraction of `self.previous_after` from `before` is not taking into account the adjustment of `before` based on the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. This leads to an incorrect value for `before`, causing the extra empty lines to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the calculation of `before` needs to be revisited. It should take into account the adjustment of `before` based on the `_maybe_empty_lines` method before subtracting `self.previous_after`.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after  # update previous_after before using it in the calculations
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
