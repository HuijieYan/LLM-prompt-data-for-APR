The bug in the code appears to be that the `before` variable is being assigned a value and then immediately decremented by `self.previous_after`, which is causing the problem.

The `before` and `after` variables are expected to represent the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line. However, in the buggy code, `before` is being decremented by `self.previous_after` before returning, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, simply remove the line `before -= self.previous_after` so that the `before` and `after` values are returned as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)

    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
