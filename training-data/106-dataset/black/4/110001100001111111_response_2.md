It seems that the issue lies within the `maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is designed to return the number of extra empty lines before and after a given `current_line`. However, in the provided buggy function, there is an issue with the calculation of the `before` variable.

From the provided information, it appears that the `before` variable is being incorrectly adjusted by subtracting `self.previous_after` without considering the special case of `current_line` being the first line, where `self.previous_after` should not be subtracted.

To fix this issue, we should check if `self.previous_line` is not `None` before subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# This is the corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    if self.previous_line is not None:  # Check if previous_line is not None
        before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

This fix addresses the issue by ensuring that the `before` value is only adjusted if `self.previous_line` is not `None`, which handles the special case of the first line.
