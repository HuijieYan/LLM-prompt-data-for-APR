The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing within the `test_beginning_backslash` test case. The failure is due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `fs` function.

The potential error in the provided function lies in the line:
```python
before -= self.previous_after
```

The error seems to be that `self.previous_after` is being used without being initialized.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the `self.previous_after` attribute in the `__init__` method of the class where this function is defined. For example:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.previous_after = 0
```

This will ensure that `self.previous_after` is initialized before it is used in the `maybe_empty_lines` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Tuple

class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
Replace `YourClassName` with the actual name of the class where the `maybe_empty_lines` method is implemented.
