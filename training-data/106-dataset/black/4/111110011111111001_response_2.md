The issue seems to be with the `maybe_empty_lines` method in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The `maybe_empty_lines` method appears to be subtracting the `previous_after` value incorrectly and updating `self.previous_after` without initializing `self.previous_after` or `self.previous_line` in the `__init__` method.

The test case `test_beginning_backslash` is failing because the actual output has two extra empty lines before the line `print("hello, world")`, whereas the expected output does not have these extra lines.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` variables in the `__init__` method. Then, we need to update the `maybe_empty_lines` method to calculate the `before` value correctly by adding `self.previous_after`. Additionally, we need to update the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` values at the end of the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

Here's the corrected `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before += self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected `__init__` method, we initialize `self.previous_after` to 0 and `self.previous_line` to None. Then, in the `maybe_empty_lines` method, we modify the calculation of `before` by adding `self.previous_after` to it. After that, we update `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` with the current values.

These changes should address the issue and ensure that the `maybe_empty_lines` method calculates the number of extra empty lines correctly according to the given input, thus passing the test case.
