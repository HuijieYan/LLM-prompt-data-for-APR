The error occurs in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the `test_beginning_backslash` test case. The error message indicates that the expected output and the actual output are not matching, specifically when comparing the number of empty lines before the print statement. This suggests that the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the number of empty lines.

The potential error location within the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `maybe_empty_lines` function might not be correctly subtracting `previous_after` from `before`, leading to incorrect results.
2. There might be an issue with how the `previous_after` and `previous_line` variables are being updated within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line` is accurate.
2. Verify that the `previous_after` and `previous_line` variables are being updated correctly within the function.

Corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    # Corrected maybe_empty_lines function
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected code, the `maybe_empty_lines` function now properly calculates the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line` and updates the `previous_after` and `previous_line` variables accordingly.
