The issue seems to be related to the `maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function receives the `current_line` and calls the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, then adjusts the `before` value and returns it. Based on the provided input and expected output, it seems that the issue lies in the adjustment of the `before` value.

The bug occurred because the `before` value was not adjusted correctly. The expected `before` value is 2, but it was adjusted incorrectly in the original code.

To fix the bug, the adjustment of the `before` value needs to be corrected. Instead of subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`, it should be added to `before` as per the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Adjusting the before value
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
