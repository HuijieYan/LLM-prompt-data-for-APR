The issue seems to be related to the `maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The `maybe_empty_lines` function is supposed to calculate the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but the calculation is incorrect, leading to a failing test case.

The reason for the bug is that the `before` value is being adjusted by subtracting `self.previous_after` before returning, which is causing the wrong result. This adjustment is unnecessary and is likely the cause of the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we should remove the line `before -= self.previous_after` from the `maybe_empty_lines` function, as it is not needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With this change, the `maybe_empty_lines` function should now return the correct number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, resolving the failing test case.
