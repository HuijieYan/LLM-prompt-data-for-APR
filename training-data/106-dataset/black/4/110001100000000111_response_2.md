The error seems to be related to the function `maybe_empty_lines` in the `black.py` file. The function is supposed to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but it seems to have a bug that results in incorrect behavior.

The bug seems to be caused by the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. There is also manipulation of the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` variables, which may be contributing to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of the before and after empty lines is accurate, and that the manipulation of `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_4/black.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# This is the corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after if hasattr(self, "previous_after") else 0
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if `self.previous_after` exists before subtracting it from `before`. This is to prevent any potential errors in case `self.previous_after` has not been initialized yet. Additionally, we have kept the manipulation of `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` as it was in the original code.
