The issue is likely within the `maybe_empty_lines` method. The error message from the test function indicates that the output from the `maybe_empty_lines` method does not match the expected output.

The `before` variable is supposed to be adjusted by subtracting the `self.previous_after` value. However, the expected value of `before` is 2, which indicates that the adjustment is not happening as expected.

One potential reason for this bug is that the adjustment of the `before` variable is not being correctly performed, leading to the incorrect comparison with the expected value.

To fix this bug, the adjustment of the `before` variable should be correctly implemented by subtracting the `self.previous_after` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after  # Correctly adjust the before variable
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
