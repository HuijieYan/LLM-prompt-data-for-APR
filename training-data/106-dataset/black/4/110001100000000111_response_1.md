The potential error location within the problematic function is the indentation of the `maybe_empty_lines` method. It seems that the method is not properly aligned, and this might be causing the issue.

The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect indentation of the `maybe_empty_lines` method. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is being formatted by Black.

To fix the bug, the `maybe_empty_lines` method should be properly aligned and the indentation should be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_4/black.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
