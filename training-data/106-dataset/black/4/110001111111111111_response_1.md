Based on the error message from the test function, it looks like the issue is related to the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The expected and actual values are not matching, indicating that the function is not correctly returning the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line`.

The potential error in the code is that the function `maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly calculating the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual values in the test.

The bug occurred because the function `maybe_empty_lines` is not properly subtracting the `self.previous_after` value from the calculated `before` value, as indicated by the line `before -= self.previous_after`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the calculation of `before` by subtracting `self.previous_after` from it before returning the value. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the `previous_after` value is correctly updated and maintained for future calls to the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after  # update calculation for before
    self.previous_after = after  # update previous_after for future calls
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line` and address the issue with the mismatch between expected and actual values in the test case.
