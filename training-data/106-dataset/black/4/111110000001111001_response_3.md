The problem with the `maybe_empty_lines` function is that it tries to access the `self.previous_after` attribute before it has been initialized. This results in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `self.previous_after` attribute with a default value. We can do this in the `__post_init__` method of the dataclass.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_after: int = 0
    previous_line = None
    
    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function 
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
