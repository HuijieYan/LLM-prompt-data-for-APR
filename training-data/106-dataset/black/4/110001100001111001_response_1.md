The bug in the provided function seems to be that the `before` variable is being decremented by `self.previous_after` which is 0, instead of being decremented by 2 as required. This discrepancy in the value of `before` can be attributed to the incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

To fix this bug, the value of `before` should be decremented by 2 instead of `self.previous_after`. Additionally, the `previous_line` attribute should be updated to `current_line` before returning the updated `before` and `after` values.

Here is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= 2  # Decrement by 2 instead of previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line  # Update previous_line attribute
    return before, after
```
