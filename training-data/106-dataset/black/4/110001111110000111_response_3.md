The test case is failing because the output of the `fs` function is not as expected. The error message indicates that the actual output of the `fs` function is different from the expected output.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is being called to determine the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but the calculation and adjustment of the `before` and `after` variables seem to be incorrect.

The `maybe_empty_lines` function is subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`, and then updating `self.previous_after` with the value of `after`. This approach seems to be contributing to the incorrect calculation of empty lines.

To fix this issue, we need to correct the adjustment of the `before` and `after` variables, and ensure that previous values are properly stored and updated for future comparisons.

The corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method would be:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we are initializing `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` to appropriate values. Additionally, we are then updating `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` within the `maybe_empty_lines` method according to the logic required for correct calculation of empty lines.
