The potential error in the `maybe_empty_lines` method is that it is referring to `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` without initializing them anywhere in the code. This will result in an error because these variables are not defined before being used.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` in the `__init__` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. We also need to modify the code in `maybe_empty_lines` to handle these variables appropriately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Assuming Line is defined somewhere

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_after: int = 0
    previous_line: Line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        if self.previous_line is None:
            before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        else:
            before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
            before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we have initialized `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` as class attributes and appropriately handled the usage of these variables in the `maybe_empty_lines` method.
