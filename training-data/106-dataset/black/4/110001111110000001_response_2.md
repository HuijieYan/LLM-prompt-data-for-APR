The error occurs at the line `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)` in the test function `test_beginning_backslash`. The error message indicates that the expected output and the actual output are not equal, with an extra newline in the actual output.

The potential error location within the `maybe_empty_lines` function could be in the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. It seems that the logic for removing the previous number of empty lines after the previous line is not functioning correctly.

The bug occurs because the `before` value is being adjusted by subtracting `self.previous_after`. However, there is no initialization of `self.previous_after`. This leads to incorrect calculations when trying to remove the previous number of empty lines.

To fix this, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` and ensure that it is updated correctly after each calculation of before and after empty lines.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    if not hasattr(self, "previous_after"):
        self.previous_after = 0  # Initialize self.previous_after
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    return before, after
```

With this fix, the function `maybe_empty_lines` initializes `self.previous_after` if it does not exist and then updates it accordingly. This should address the bug and produce the correct output.
