The error occurs in the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The error message indicates that the expected and actual values are different, with the actual value having additional empty lines at the beginning compared to the expected value.

The bug occurs because in the `maybe_empty_lines` method, the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` is incorrect. Specifically, the line `before -= self.previous_after` is causing the issue where it subtracts `self.previous_after` from `before` without checking whether it is already included in the calculation.

To fix this bug, the algorithm for calculating the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line should be revised. In addition, the variable `previous_after` is not initialized in the provided code, so it should be initialized in the `__init__` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    if self.previous_line is None:  # Check if this is the first line
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    else:
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before += 2  # Add extra empty lines based on the description
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In this corrected code, the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line is calculated based on the description provided in the function's docstring. Additionally, missing initialization of `previous_after` is not needed as it is not used in the corrected code.
