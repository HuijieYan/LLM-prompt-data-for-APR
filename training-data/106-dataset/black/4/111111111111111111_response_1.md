The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because it expected the actual value to have an extra two empty lines at the beginning, but it only had one. This discrepancy is likely due to the buggy function `maybe_empty_lines` not properly calculating the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line`.

The issue is likely occurring in the `maybe_empty_lines` function where the variable `before` is being computed incorrectly. The function is supposed to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but it seems the computation of `before` is incorrect.

The reason for the bug could be that the computation of `before` is not taking into account the addition of two extra empty lines at the module-level. It could also be due to the incorrect adjustment of `before` using the `self.previous_after`.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the computation of `before` to include the addition of two extra empty lines at the module-level, and then adjust it using the `self.previous_after`. Also, ensure that the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` are updated correctly for subsequent calls to the function.

Here's the corrected `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after + 2  # add two extra empty lines at module level
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
