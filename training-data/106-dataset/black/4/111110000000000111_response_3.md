The issue seems to be related to the code formatting tool "Black" producing different code on the second pass of the formatter. The specific error mentioned is "Explicit line join in the first line". 

Upon reviewing the provided code, it seems that the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the source of the error. The problem is that the `before` variable is being modified by subtracting `self.previous_after` which is not initialized or defined anywhere in the class. This could be the reason for the "Explicit line join in the first line" error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_after` is properly initialized with a default value. We can do this in the constructor of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# class declaration containing the fixed function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    previous_after: int = 0
    previous_line: Line = None

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the fixed function
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, I have initialized `self.previous_after` with a default value of 0 in the class declaration. This should resolve the bug and prevent the "Explicit line join in the first line" error.
