Potential error location: 
The error is likely to be in the line `before -= self.previous_after` where `self.previous_after` is being used before it has been initialized.

Reason behind the bug:
The variable `self.previous_after` is being used without being initialized anywhere in the function or the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize `self.previous_after` as an instance variable.
2. Update the value of `self.previous_after` before using it in the calculation.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None
    
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
