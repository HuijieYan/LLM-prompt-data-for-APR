It appears that the issue is related to the `EmptyLineTracker` in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The bug occurs when the `before` and `after` values are not correctly adjusted based on the `self.previous_after` value. This incorrect adjustment leads to unexpected behavior when the function is called multiple times, as seen in the provided GitHub issue title and description.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `maybe_empty_lines` method to correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, and properly adjust the `self.previous_after` value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
    
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, `self` seems to be a class with a method `maybe_empty_lines` and a class variable `previous_after`. We added a `__init__` method to initialize the `previous_after` variable. We also made sure that the `maybe_empty_lines` method returns the correct values for the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
