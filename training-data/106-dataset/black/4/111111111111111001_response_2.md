The buggy function `maybe_empty_lines` subtracts `self.previous_after` from the variable `before` but doesn't update the `self.previous_after` before using it in the calculation. As a result, it may lead to unexpected results and the failure of the test case `test_beginning_backslash`. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location is identified in the calculation of the `before` variable, where `self.previous_after` is subtracted without being updated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.previous_after` variable is not being updated before being used in the calculation. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results and the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, update the `self.previous_after` before using it in the calculation. This ensures that the correct value is used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after  # Update self.previous_after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
