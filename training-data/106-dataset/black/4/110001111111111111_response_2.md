The error message from the test function indicates that there is an AssertionError because the expected output and the actual output do not match. The expected output is 'print("hello, world")\n' while the actual output is '\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'. This suggests that there is a difference in the number of empty lines before the actual code. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` using the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

The bug likely occurs because the function is not correctly subtracting the previous_after value from the before value in the maybe_empty_lines method. This leads to an incorrect counting of the number of empty lines before the current line.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct calculation is made by subtracting the previous_after value from the before value before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    
    def __init__(self, is_pyi: bool, previous_line, previous_after: int, previous_defs: list):
        self.is_pyi = is_pyi
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after  # Subtract previous_after value
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
