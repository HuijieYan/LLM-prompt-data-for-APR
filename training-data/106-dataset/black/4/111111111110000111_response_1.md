The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing, indicating that the expected output and the actual output are not matching. This points to a potential issue within the `maybe_empty_lines` function, as it is responsible for manipulating the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of the `before` variable before it is returned. The line `before -= self.previous_after` is likely causing the issue, as it is not clear what `self.previous_after` is and whether it's initialized properly.

The bug is occurring because the manipulation of the `before` variable (`before -= self.previous_after`) is not properly handled. It's unclear whether `self.previous_after` is initialized properly, leading to this calculation issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_after` are properly initialized before using them in the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    if hasattr(self, 'previous_after') and hasattr(self, 'previous_line'):
        before -= getattr(self, 'previous_after', 0)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` are properly initialized before manipulating the `before` variable. By using `hasattr` and `getattr`, we ensure that the code doesn't break if these attributes are not initialized.

This should address the bug and prevent the assertion error.
