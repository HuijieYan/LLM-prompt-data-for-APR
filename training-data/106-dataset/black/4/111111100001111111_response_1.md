The bug seems to be related to the `previous_after` variable and its usage in the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
The issue is that the `previous_after` variable is being used to adjust the `before` value, but the adjustment is incorrect. This results in an incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line`.

The `previous_after` should be updated with the value of `after` after the computation to ensure that the correct adjustment can be made in the next call to `maybe_empty_lines`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `maybe_empty_lines` method to properly handle the `previous_after` variable and perform the adjustments correctly.

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    adjusted_before = before - self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return adjusted_before, after
```

With this correction, the `adjusted_before` variable ensures that the correct adjustment is made based on the previous calculation, and the `previous_after` variable is updated for use in the next call to `maybe_empty_lines`.
