The error message from the test function `test_beginning_backslash` indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected output and the actual output are different. The expected output is `'print("hello, world")\n'`, while the actual output is `'\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'`.

Based on the provided information, it is apparent that the `maybe_empty_lines` method is not properly handling the addition of extra empty lines before the current line.

The bug seems to be occurring in the `maybe_empty_lines` method due to incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before the current line. The expected behavior is to add extra empty lines before and after the current line, depending on certain conditions.

The bug is likely caused by the miscalculation or incorrect manipulation of the variables `before` and `after` in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. This results in the generation of unexpected output, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the `maybe_empty_lines` method should correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += 2  # Add 2 extra empty lines before the current line
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `before` variable includes the correct number of extra empty lines before the current line, and we set the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` variables accordingly.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `maybe_empty_lines` method functions as expected in adding the correct number of extra empty lines before and after the current line.
