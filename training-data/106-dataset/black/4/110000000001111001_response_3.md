Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the line `before -= self.previous_after` where `before` is an `int` type and `self.previous_after` is also an `int` type. The current value of `self.previous_after` has already been subtracted from `before`, therefore, the deduction on this line is redundant and causing the incorrect result.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code is intended to handle the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but the subtraction operation is applied incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Remove the line `before -= self.previous_after` as it is redundant and causing the incorrect result.
- Update the logic to accurately adjust the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
