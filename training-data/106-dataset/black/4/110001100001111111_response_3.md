The bug seems to be occurring in the maybe_empty_lines function. The function is expected to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the current_line, but it is not doing so correctly.

The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the 'before' variable, which is subtracted by self.previous_after. This operation is likely causing the incorrect return value for 'before'. Also, the 'after' variable is not being modified as expected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the line 'before -= self.previous_after' and ensure that the 'after' variable is properly updated. Also, it's important to initialize self.previous_after and self.previous_line in the constructor of the EmptyLineTracker class.

Here's the corrected code for the maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
