Potential error location:
```python
before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
```

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message shows a string comparison assertion failure. This suggests that the incorrect number of empty lines is being added or subtracted when calling the `before` and `after` variables from the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be checked to ensure that it calculates the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. The `maybe_empty_lines` function itself should also be reviewed to see if the adjustments made to `before` and `after` are correct.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= getattr(self, "previous_after", 0)
    setattr(self, "previous_after", after)
    setattr(self, "previous_line", current_line)
    return before, after
```
