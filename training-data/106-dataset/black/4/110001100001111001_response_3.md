The issue in the provided code is that the 'before' variable is being reassigned after the '_maybe_empty_lines' function is called. As a result, the incorrect value is being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'before' variable is not reassigned before the return statement. We should use a different variable to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line and then subtract 'previous_after' from it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, is_pyi: bool, previous_line: Line, previous_after: int, previous_defs: list):
        self.is_pyi = is_pyi
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        empty_lines_before = before - self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return empty_lines_before, after
```
