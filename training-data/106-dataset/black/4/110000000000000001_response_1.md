The potential error in the given function is the usage of `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` without initializing them. This could lead to errors as they are being used without being defined.

To fix this, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` either in the constructor of the class or at an appropriate location before their usage in the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` in the constructor of the class to avoid any undefined usage within the `maybe_empty_lines` method.
