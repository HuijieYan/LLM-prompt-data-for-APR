The error occurs in the `test_beginning_backslash` test function where the `assertFormatEqual` method is called. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'print("hello, world")\n' while the actual output is '\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'. This suggests that the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not working as expected, causing unexpected extra empty lines before the printed line.

The potential error in the `maybe_empty_lines` function is in this line:
```python
before -= self.previous_after
```

It seems that `self.previous_after` is not properly initialized and is causing the wrong computation of the number of empty lines before the current line.

The bug occurs because `self.previous_after` is not initialized when the class is instantiated, leading to an unexpected value when trying to subtract it from `before`. To fix the bug, `self.previous_after` should be initialized before it is used.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    
    # Initialize self.previous_after if not already initialized
    if not hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        self.previous_after = 0
    
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    return before, after
```

Initializing `self.previous_after` to 0 ensures that it always has a value to subtract from `before`, preventing unexpected behavior.
