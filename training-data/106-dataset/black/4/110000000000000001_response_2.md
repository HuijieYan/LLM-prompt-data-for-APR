Potential error location: The error seems to be in the line "before -= self.previous_after" where "self.previous_after" is not defined.

Reason for the bug: The variable "self.previous_after" is not defined anywhere in the function or the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to define the variable "self.previous_after" before it can be subtracted from the "before" variable.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    pass

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
