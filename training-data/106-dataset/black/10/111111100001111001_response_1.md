The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has the logic to partially consume characters from the prefix string to a given column. It seems to have issues with handling new lines and calculating the number of spaces and tabs.

The logic for checking new lines and updating the line buffer `lines` and `current_line` is incorrect. When a new line is encountered, the function needs to check if the current line has reached the desired column, if not, it should consume the characters and move to the next line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                break
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if current_column <= column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                break
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            if current_column <= column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                break
        else:
            current_column += 1
            if current_column <= column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                break
    
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through each character in the prefix string and updates the `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly. When encountering a new line character, it checks if the current line has reached the desired column. If not, it adds the line to `lines` and resets the `current_line` and `current_column`. If the desired column is reached, it breaks the loop and returns the result accordingly.
