Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the handling of tabs and spaces in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`. The current implementation does not properly handle tab characters and their effect on the indentation.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not correctly account for the difference in visual indentation caused by tab characters compared to spaces. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels and results in the misalignment of comments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a consistent approach for handling both tab and space characters to ensure accurate counting of indentation levels.
2. Implement logic to convert tab characters to spaces to ensure uniform handling of indentation.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
With these corrections, the function should now properly handle both tab and space characters to accurately determine the indentation levels, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
