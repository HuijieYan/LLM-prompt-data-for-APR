The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation of the comments after a dedent. The issue occurs when the input file uses tabs for indentation, and the comments are not correctly aligned after a dedent.

The potential error location within the function is in the logic that handles the indentation and the waiting for a new line character. The logic for handling tab characters and the indentation level is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by properly checking and updating the current column value based on the encountered characters, including spaces and tabs.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The logic now properly checks for spaces, tabs, and new lines, and updates the current column value accordingly.
