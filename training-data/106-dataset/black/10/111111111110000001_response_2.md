The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the actual output does not match the expected output for some test cases.

Upon analyzing the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that the issue might be related to how the function handles lines and columns when consuming the prefix.

The bug in the function is likely caused by the improper handling of white spaces and new lines. Specifically, the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line may not be functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for tracking the current column and determining when to wait for a new line. Additionally, we need to ensure that the indentation and comments are properly handled when consuming the prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char

        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle indentations and comments, and the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
