Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring within the if statement that checks for the newline character ('\n') and the wait_for_nl flag. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The if statement that checks for the newline character and the wait_for_nl flag is not properly handling the case where the current line is empty, resulting in the lines not being properly appended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the condition for checking if the current line is empty.
2. Ensure that the wait_for_nl flag is correctly updated when encountering a newline character.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
