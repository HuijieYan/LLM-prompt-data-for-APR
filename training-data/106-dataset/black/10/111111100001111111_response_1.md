The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the indentation level when encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling indentation levels when encountering a newline character. We should also ensure that the comment indentation is preserved after a dedent.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                if len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:  # Adjust column for tabs
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by correctly handling the indentation levels and preserving the comment indentation after a dedent.
