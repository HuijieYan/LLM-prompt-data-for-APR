The error message is indicating that there is an assertion error in the test function `test_comment_indentation`. Specifically, the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing on comparing `contents_tab` with `contents_spc`. It shows that the expected output is not the same as the actual output, and it highlights a difference in indentation for a comment line.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the logic related to handling indentation, particularly the `if char == ' '` and `elif char == '\t'` conditions. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the indentation when consuming the input prefix.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not accurately tracking the indentation level and handling the new line characters when consuming the prefix. This leads to incorrect parsing and extraction of the prefix contents.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic related to handling indentation and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Additionally, we can improve the overall logic for consuming the prefix string to ensure correct results.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                if not current_line or current_line[-1] == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == '\t':
                if not current_line or current_line[-1] == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This modified function includes changes in handling newline characters, spaces, and tabs to ensure proper indentation tracking and prefix consumption.
