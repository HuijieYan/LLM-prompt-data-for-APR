The issue occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method of the `Driver` class. The purpose of this method is to consume part of a prefix string up to a certain column number, based on the indentation level.

The error message from the test function indicates that the formatting of the output string is incorrect when the input string contains tab characters. The test comparison expects the output of `fs(contents_tab)` to be equal to `contents_spc`, which is the properly formatted string using spaces. However, the output is incorrect due to the incorrect behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method.

The potential error location within the method is the logic related to tracking the current column and identifying when to wait for a new line. The current implementation seems to have issues while handling tabs and deciding when to consume the prefix.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the handling of tab characters and indentation is not correctly implemented in the method. As a result, the method fails to properly consume the prefix and identify the correct indentation level, leading to incorrect formatting of the output string.

To fix the bug, the logic for tracking the current column and consuming the prefix needs to be revised. Specifically, the handling of tab characters should be properly implemented to accurately calculate the current column and consume the prefix accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    wait_for_nl = False
                if char != ' ':  # Indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected method, the handling of tab characters is incorporated by incrementing the current column by the appropriate amount. Additionally, the logic for identifying when to wait for a new line and when the indent is finished is modified.

After applying this fix, the `fs(contents_tab)` output should be correctly formatted and match `contents_spc` as expected.
