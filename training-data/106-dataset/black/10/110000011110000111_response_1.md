The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called with the `fs(contents_tab)` and `contents_spc` arguments. The error message indicates that there is an indentation mismatch for the commented line in the `contents_tab` variable, which is being compared with the expected output in the `contents_spc` variable.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation. It seems that the function does not handle the indentation properly, leading to incorrect behavior when processing the input.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation levels in the input prefix, especially when dealing with tabs and spaces. This results in the incorrect calculation of the current column and the handling of comments after dedent.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for handling tabs and spaces, and improve the calculation of the current column and the identification of when to wait for a newline character.

Here's the corrected code for the `partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Ensure column is multiple of 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these modifications, we ensure that tabs are handled correctly, and the current column is calculated accurately. This should address the issue described in the error message.
