The error message indicates that the assertion in the test case `test_comment_indentation` has failed. It seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments with indentation after a dedent.

Upon analyzing the code, it is observed that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments. This is causing the assertion in the test case to fail.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the indentation logic for comments when there is a change in indentation level. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the indentation logic for comments when there is a change in the indentation level. Additionally, the logic for maintaining the correct column position and waiting for a new line needs to be adjusted.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
        return res, ''
```

The corrected function ensures that the logic for handling indentation and waiting for a new line is appropriately implemented, which should resolve the issue with incorrect comment indentation.
