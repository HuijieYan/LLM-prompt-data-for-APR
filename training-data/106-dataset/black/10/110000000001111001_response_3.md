The issue with the _partially_consume_prefix function is that it doesn't correctly handle the indentation and column count. 

The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character. It sets wait_for_nl to True but doesn't reset it to False after finding the newline. This prevents the function from correctly counting the column position.

To fix the bug, we need to reset wait_for_nl to False after encountering a newline character.

Here's the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # reset wait_for_nl to False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
