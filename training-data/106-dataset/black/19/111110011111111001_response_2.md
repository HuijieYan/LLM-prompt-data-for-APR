The error occurs because the output of the function `fs(source)` does not match the expected output. The error message indicates a difference in the number of empty lines in the output. This implies that the logic for handling empty lines in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not working as expected.

The error is likely due to the conditional checks and assignments within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function not handling all possible cases correctly. For example, the logic to handle decorators and previous definitions may not be capturing all relevant scenarios.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and assignments within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure all possible cases are accounted for. Specifically, the logic for handling decorators, previous definitions, and flow control statements should be carefully examined.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0
    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected code accounts for various scenarios and provides the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line. The conditional checks have been adjusted to handle different combinations of conditions more effectively.
