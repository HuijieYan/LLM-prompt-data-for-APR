The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual outputs in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case. The assertion fails because the actual output contains extra empty lines that are not present in the expected output.

The potential error location within the function is the logic that determines when to add newlines. It seems that the conditions for adding newlines are not properly handled, leading to the incorrect addition of extra empty lines in the actual output.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle the logic of adding newlines correctly. The incorrect addition of newlines resulted in the actual output containing extra empty lines compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding newlines in different scenarios should be carefully reviewed and adjusted as needed. Specifically, the conditions for adding newlines before and after certain elements (decorators, definitions, imports, etc.) need to be revised to ensure that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the given scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2  # Adjust the max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if any([current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if any([self.previous_line, self.previous_line.is_decorator]):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected code, I've adjusted the logic to properly determine the max_allowed number of empty lines, handle the before variable based on specific conditions and adjusted the cases for adding newlines based on different scenarios.
