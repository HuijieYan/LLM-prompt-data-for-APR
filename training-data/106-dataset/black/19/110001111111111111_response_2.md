The problem seems to be occurring in the `fs` function, which is likely responsible for formatting a given source code. The test case is comparing the expected output with the actual output but they are not matching, resulting in an assertion error.

Potential error location: The issue could be within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This method seems to be responsible for handling certain line types and deciding whether or not to add empty lines.

Reason for bug: The logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method might not be correctly handling all the conditions and line types, causing unexpected empty lines to be added or omitted, resulting in formatting mismatches with the expected output.

Approach for fixing the bug: Ensure that the method correctly handles all the different line types and follows the formatting rules consistently.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ... (other methods)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

The corrected method now handles all the different line types and their formatting conditions properly to ensure consistent and expected output.
