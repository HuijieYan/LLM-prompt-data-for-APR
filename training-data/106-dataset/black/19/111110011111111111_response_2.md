The error message indicates that there are discrepancies between the expected output and the actual output when running the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case. The error message specifically shows differences related to extra newlines being added in the actual output. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling the addition of newlines correctly.

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to stem from the logic related to adding empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is not properly handling the insertion of newlines in certain cases, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

To address the buggy behavior, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function related to the addition of newlines needs to be reviewed and potentially reworked to ensure that it accurately handles the insertion of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    before = 0
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.depth):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and
        current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic for handling the addition of newlines before and after the currently processed line and aims to address the issues observed in the test case.
