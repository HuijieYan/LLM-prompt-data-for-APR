The problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several distinct issues. One of the underlying bugs is that while a change is made to the `before` variable within the function, the value of `before` is superseded by certain conditional blocks (e.g., `depth = 0`) before being returned. These overwrite statements mean that the function doesn't behave as intended.

The positional resetting of `before` within conditional blocks such as `if` is a mistake. These block structures should return a single choice of before or after additional white space values, but the current implementation doesnâ€™t do this efficiently.

One feasible approach for improving the function is to evolve a system that retrieves input line data and makes decisions based on that criterion. Using conditional blocks, a script can be orchestrated to return the required values of our ecosystem whenever matching data records are found. This would guarantee the function returns a correct match, avoiding extraneous returns that corrupt the matches.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Updated and corrected function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    # ... Rest of the code remains the same ...
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
