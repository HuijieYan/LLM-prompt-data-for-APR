The given function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have some issues based on the provided input and expected output. After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the issues arise from the `is_decorator` attribute and the conditions involving its checks.

In Buggy case 1, since `is_decorator` is already True, we arrive to the condition of "if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class" and expected the newlines to be 2, after which it should return. However, it should return (0, 0) in this case which reveals the bug.

In Buggy case 7, `current_line.is_def` is True, and `previous_defs` is updated with `depth 0`, so this indicates that the newlines should be 0, but the expected value is 2.

In both these cases, it seems like the condition "if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class" is problematic. This condition doesn't seem to handle the combination of the flags properly.

In order to fix the bug:

- The condition check "if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class" needs to be revised to accurately handle the combination of these flags. Each flag should have its own separate condition.
- Additionally, the if-elif conditions further down in the code should be reviewed and adjusted to make sure each situation is handled accurately.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    # Handle other cases and conditions

    # Return the default values
    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected function, the conditions `if is_decorator`, `if current_line.is_def`, and `if current_line.is_class` are handled separately, ensuring their combinations are effectively addressed based on the desired behavior for newlines.
