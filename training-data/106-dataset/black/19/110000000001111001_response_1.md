The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle various cases related to indentation, decorators, flow control, and various statement types in Python code. It returns a tuple of two integers based on certain conditions.

Issues:
1. In some instances, the code incorrectly sets `newlines` to `2` based solely on the condition `if is_decorator`. This doesn't cover all cases, leading to incorrect return values.
2. The while loop that modifies `previous_defs` checks if `depth` is truthy, instead of whether it's non-zero.
3. The handling of certain cases isn't aligned with the logic defined at the beginning of the function.

Approach:
1. Review the conditions and operations related to setting the `newlines` value to ensure that various cases are handled correctly, including all scenarios related to decorators, classes, and flow control.
2. Correct the while loop to check for non-zero depth instead of truthy values.
3. Ensure that the handling of different Python statement types is aligned with the logic defined at the beginning of the function.

The corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
