The error message shows that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual output are not matching. The expected output has multiple empty lines, while the actual output does not.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the addition of empty lines before and after the lines. This results in the expected and actual outputs not matching, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line needs to be corrected. This might involve adjusting the conditions and calculations for the number of empty lines to be added before and after the line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    # handle empty lines before the line
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
This corrected code should address the logic for handling empty lines before and after the lines, resolving the bug that caused the test failure.
