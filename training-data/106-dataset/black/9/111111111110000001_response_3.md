The error message indicates a parsing issue related to the `print` statement with the Python 2 version. The error is occurring in the `lib2to3_parse` function, and the `get_grammars` function is called within it. This suggests that the issue lies within the `get_grammars` function and how it handles Python 2 compatibility.

The bug occurs because the `is_python2()` method is being called as a method of the `version` object, but it's actually a method of the class itself. This causes a `TypeError` as the `version` object does not have an `is_python2` method.

To fix the bug, the `is_python2` method should be a class method and should not depend on the `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import pygram, TargetVersion, Grammar  # assuming these imports are required

def is_python2() -> bool:  # change to class method
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not TargetVersion.is_python2() for version in target_versions):  # fix method call
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

With these changes, the `is_python2` method can be called directly from the `TargetVersion` class, and the bug causing the `TypeError` should be resolved.
