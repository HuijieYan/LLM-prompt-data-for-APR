The error message indicates that there is a problem with how black is handling the print function when the target version is set to py27. The error is related to unnecessary whitespace being added around the print statement.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_grammars` function. It seems that there is a conditional branch that should handle the case of target version set to py27 and return the appropriate grammar for that version. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, resulting in the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_grammars` function does not appropriately handle the logic for the target version set to py27. This results in the incorrect grammar being used for formatting the print statements when the target version is set to py27.

To fix the bug, the `get_grammars` function should be modified to correctly handle the case when the target version is set to py27. This can be achieved by checking if the py27 version is in the set of target versions and returning the appropriate grammar for that version.

Here's the corrected `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
