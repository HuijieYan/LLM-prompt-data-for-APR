Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the block of code where it checks for Python 2 compatibility and returns the Python grammars.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is caused by the unnecessary check for Python 2 compatibility and the return of specific Python grammars when the target version is Python 2. This results in the unexpected whitespace being added to the print statement.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to remove the unnecessary check for Python 2 compatibility and always return the default Python grammar. This will ensure that the print statement is not affected by the target version and unnecessary whitespace is not added.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from black import Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary check for Python 2 compatibility is removed, and the function always returns the default Python grammar. This should fix the issue with unnecessary whitespace being added to the print statement.
