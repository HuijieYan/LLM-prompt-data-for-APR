The error occurs at the function `get_grammars()` in the code. The error message suggests that the code is attempting to parse source text using `lib2to3` but encountering a problem with the syntax at line 6, column 13, which is the `print(a, file=sys.stderr)` statement. This is because the `target_versions` set provided to the `get_grammars()` function is not being used correctly to determine which grammar to apply for the code parsing.

The bug occurs because the condition `if not target_versions` is evaluating to `False`, so the first block of code in the function is not executed even when `target_versions` is not empty.

To fix the bug, the condition `if not target_versions` should be `if target_versions`. Additionally, the `all` function should be used to check if all versions in `target_versions` are using Python 2, and based on that, the appropriate grammar should be selected.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Set, Iterable
from lib2to3.pgen2.parse import ParseError
from lib2to3 import pygram, pytree, driver
from lib2to3.pytree import Node
from enum import Enum

class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2

class Grammar:
    # stub for Grammar class
    pass

GRAMMARS = [Grammar()]

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if target_versions:  # Use the set if it's not empty
        if all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
            # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
            return [
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
            ]
        else:
            return [pygram.python_grammar]
    else:  # The set is empty, so return default
        return GRAMMARS
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `target_versions` set and select the appropriate grammar for parsing the source text, which should resolve the error encountered during testing.
