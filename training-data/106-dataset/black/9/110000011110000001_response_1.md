The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `fs` function's parsing of the Python code when the target version is set to Python 2. 

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the `elif` condition where it checks if all target versions are not Python 2. In this condition, it returns a list with two Python grammars, which might not be compatible with the parser in the `fs` function.

The reason behind the bug is that when the target versions are not empty but contain versions that are not Python 2, the function returns Python 2-compatible grammars, which could cause issues when parsing Python 3 code.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `get_grammars` function to return the appropriate grammar based on the target versions. If all versions are Python 2, then it should return the Python 2-compatible grammars; otherwise, it should return the Python 3 grammar.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set

# Assuming the Grammar and TargetVersion classes are imported

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so return Python 2 grammars
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

With this corrected code, the `get_grammars` function will return the appropriate grammar based on the target versions, ensuring that the code behaves correctly when parsing Python 2 or Python 3 code.
