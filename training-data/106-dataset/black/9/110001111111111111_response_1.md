The error occurs when the `get_grammars` function is called with the target version `PY27`. Looking at the error message, it seems like the issue is related to parsing the source code. The `lib2to3_parse` function raises an `InvalidInput` error, indicating a problem parsing the source code.

The issue here is likely related to how the `get_grammars` function handles the Python 2 target version. It should return the appropriate grammars for Python 2, but it seems to be causing a problem in parsing the source code for the print statement.

To fix this issue, modify the `get_grammars` function to ensure that it returns the correct grammars for Python 2 target versions. In this case, it should return the grammars for Python 2 without adding unnecessary spaces around the `print` statement.

Here's the corrected `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement, 
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected function, when a Python 2 target version is present in the set of target versions, it returns the grammars that don't add unnecessary spaces around the `print` statement.

By implementing this change, the issue with unnecessary whitespace around `print()` for target_version = py27 should be resolved.
