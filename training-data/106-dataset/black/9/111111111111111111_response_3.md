The error occurs in the `get_grammars` function. The function is expecting a set of `TargetVersion` as input, but the buggy code does not handle this input correctly. The code is trying to call the `is_python2` method on each `TargetVersion` object in the if condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. The expected behavior should be to check if a particular version is Python 2 or not.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to call the `is_python2` method on a specific version, and if that version is Python 2, then return the corresponding grammar. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# relative function's signature in this file
def is_python2(self) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

By using the `any` function to check if any version in the set is Python 2 and returning the corresponding grammar, we can fix the bug.
