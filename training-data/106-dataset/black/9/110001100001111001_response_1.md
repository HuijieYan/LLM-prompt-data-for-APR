Potential error location: The error occurs in the line `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. The `is_python2` function is being called as an instance method, but it is defined as a static method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `is_python2` method is intended to be a static method, but it is currently defined as an instance method. This means that it should be called on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class. As a result, the current implementation of `is_python2` is incorrect and causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the `is_python2` method to be a static method and call it using the class name rather than an instance.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_grammars`:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from black.TargetVersion import TargetVersion
from black.Grammar import Grammar

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not TargetVersion.is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, the `is_python2` method has been changed to a static method and is called using the class name `TargetVersion`.
