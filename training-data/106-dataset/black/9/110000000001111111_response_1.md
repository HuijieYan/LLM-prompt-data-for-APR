Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the section of the code where it checks for Python 2 compatibility and returns a specific set of grammars for Python 2.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the conditional statement that checks for Python 2 compatibility. It is not handling the case where the target version is specifically set to Python 2 (PY27), which is causing the incorrect grammar to be returned.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to update the conditional statement to handle the case where the target version is specifically set to Python 2 (PY27) and then return the appropriate grammar for Python 2.

```python
from typing import Set, List
from enum import Enum


class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2
    PY3 = 3

class Grammar:
    pass  # Placeholder for the Grammar class

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, we have added the PY27 check in the conditional statement, and if the target version is Python 2, it returns the appropriate set of grammars for Python 2 compatibility.
