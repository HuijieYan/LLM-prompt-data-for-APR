The error occurs when trying to run the test_python2_print_function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with unnecessary whitespace being added around the print() function when the target_version is set to py27. The error occurs in the format_str function of black.py.

Upon analyzing the code of get_grammars function, it seems that the logic for identifying Python 2 compatibility is incorrect. The bug occurs because the condition checking for Python 2 compatibility is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the get_grammars function to correctly identify and handle Python 2 compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the get_grammars function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, we use `any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions)` to check if any of the target versions include Python 2 compatibility. This ensures that the correct grammar is returned based on the target_versions.

By using this corrected logic, unnecessary whitespace around the print() function should no longer occur when the target_version is set to py27.
