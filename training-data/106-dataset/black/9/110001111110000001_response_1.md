Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `lib2to3_parse` function, specifically when calling the `get_grammars` function with a set of target versions.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `get_grammars` function is called with a set of target versions, but it is missing the `self` parameter since it is defined as a method within a class. This is likely causing the error as it cannot be called properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the `get_grammars` function so that it can be called as a method.
2. If the `get_grammars` function doesn't depend on any instance attributes or methods, it could be defined as a static method or a class method instead of an instance method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Set, List
from .grammar import Grammar, TargetVersion
from . import pygram

class ClassName:
    def is_python2(self) -> bool:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
        if not target_versions:
            return GRAMMARS
        elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
            # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
            return [
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement
            ]
        else:
            return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code, the `get_grammars` function is defined as a static method within a class (represented as `ClassName`). The `self` parameter is removed, and it can be called without needing an instance of the class.
