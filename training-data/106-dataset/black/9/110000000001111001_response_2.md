The buggy function `get_grammars` is supposed to return a list of grammars based on the input `target_versions`. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The function takes a set of `target_versions` as input, but the `Set` type is not imported from the `typing` module. This will cause a NameError when the function is called.

2. In the first `if not target_versions` condition, it checks if `target_versions` is empty. However, since `target_versions` is a set, it will never be empty, and the intention might be to check for the presence of specific versions within the set.

3. The condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` checks if all target versions are not Python 2. However, the method `is_python2()` is not defined in the provided code, so this will cause an AttributeError.

To fix these issues, we can:

1. Import the `Set` and `List` types from the `typing` module.
2. Modify the condition to check if a specific version is present in the `target_versions` set.
3. Define the `is_python2()` method or use an appropriate method for checking the Python version.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Set
# Assuming the import for pygram modules is present

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    from pygram import python_grammar, python_grammar_no_print_statement, python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement

    if any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        return [
            python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code:
1. We import the necessary types from the `typing` module.
2. We import the required grammar modules from `pygram`.
3. We use the `any` function to check if `TargetVersion.PY27` is present in the `target_versions` set and return the corresponding grammars as per the buggy code's logic.
