The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source text due to a problematic input related to the print function with Python 2 syntax. The `fs` function is trying to parse the source text using `lib2to3_parse`, and it fails due to the inability to understand the Python 2 syntax for the print function.

The buggy function `get_grammars` seems to have a conditional block that is intended to handle Python 2-compatible code, but it does not seem to be functioning correctly. The issue stems from the fact that the function is not checking for Python 2 specifically and is using incorrect conditions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly check if the `black.TargetVersion.PY27` is in the `target_versions` set. If it is, then return the Python 2 compatible grammars, otherwise, return the Python 3 grammar.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check for `TargetVersion.PY27` in the `target_versions` set. If it is found, we return the Python 2-compatible grammars. Otherwise, we return the Python 3 grammar. This should address the issue and allow the `lib2to3_parse` to handle the Python 2 syntax properly.
