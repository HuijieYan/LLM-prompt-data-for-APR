The error message seems to indicate that there is an issue with parsing Python 2 code, specifically related to the `print` function. The function `get_grammars` is likely the source of the problem, as it determines which grammars to use for parsing Python code based on the target_versions argument.

The bug occurs because when a target version is provided, the function incorrectly assumes that the provided versions are Python 3 versions. This leads to the exclusion of Python 2-compatible code, causing the parsing issue mentioned in the error message.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case when Python 2-compatible code should be included for parsing. This can be achieved by checking for the presence of Python 2 versions in the `target_versions` argument and including the Python 2-compatible grammars accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Include Python 2-compatible code
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected version, I've used `any` to check for the presence of Python 2 versions in the `target_versions` set. If any Python 2 version is present, it includes the Python 2-compatible grammars along with the Python 3 grammar, which should fix the parsing issue seen in the error message.
