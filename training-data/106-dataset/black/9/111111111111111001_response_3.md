The test case 'test_python2_print_function' calls the function 'fs(source, mode=mode)', where 'mode' is an instance of 'black.FileMode' with the attribute 'target_versions' set to '{black.TargetVersion.PY27}'. The problematic function 'get_grammars' is being called with the 'target_versions' set.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source text using 'lib2to3' due to the parameter being passed to 'get_grammars' in 'black.py'.

The bug seems to be in the 'get_grammars' function, specifically in the way it processes the 'target_versions' set. The condition 'all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)' is the likely cause of the error. The error message also mentions that Python was unable to parse the source text.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the condition 'all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)' accurately represents the Python 2 conditions.
2. Ensure that 'target_versions' is being processed correctly inside 'get_grammars'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_grammars' function:

```python
from typing import Set, List, Iterable
from lib2to3.pgen2 import driver
from lib2to3.pgen2 import grammar as pygram

def is_python2(self) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code:
1. The condition 'all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)' has been changed to 'any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions)' to accurately represent Python 2 conditions.
2. 'get_grammars' is now processing 'target_versions' in a way that reflects the correct logic for Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility.
