Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the conditional statement checking for Python 2 compatibility.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the conditional check `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition is checking whether all the versions in `target_versions` are not Python 2, but it should be checking if any version is Python 2.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the conditional check to `if any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` to correctly identify if any version is Python 2.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
