The error occurs in the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the `lib2to3_parse` call. The error message indicates that the code is trying to parse a line that contains the `print` function with the `file` parameter, which is invalid for Python 2. This is due to the fact that the `get_grammars` function is not handling the Python version check correctly.

The potential error location is in the `elif` branch of the `get_grammars` function, where it checks if the target version is not Python 2. The logic here is flawed as it's checking for all target versions to not be Python 2 before returning Python 3 grammar, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the `get_grammars` function should directly check if the Python 2 version is in the `target_versions` set and return the appropriate grammar.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# Assuming Grammar and TargetVersion classes are imported correctly

# corrected function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

By directly checking if Python 2 is in the `target_versions` set and returning the appropriate grammar, the function should now behave as intended.
