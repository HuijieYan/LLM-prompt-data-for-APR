The issue seems to be related to the handling of target versions in the `get_grammars` function, as it determines which Python version's grammar should be used.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the condition `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition seems to be incorrectly checking for Python 2 compatibility.

The bug seems to occur because the function is not handling the target versions correctly. It assumes that if all target versions are not Python 2, then it should use Python 3 grammar. This assumption is incorrect and leads to unexpected behavior.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly check for the presence of `TargetVersion.PY27` in the `target_versions` set. If it is present, then use Python 2-compatible grammars; otherwise, use Python 3 grammar.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from enum import Enum

class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = "py27"

class Grammar:
    pass

pygram = None  # assuming pygram is an external module

GRAMMARS = []  # assuming GRAMMARS is defined elsewhere

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for the presence of `TargetVersion.PY27` in the `target_versions` set and returns the appropriate grammars based on that condition.
