The error seems to be occurring in the `get_grammars` function. Specifically, when the target version is `py27` it is adding unnecessary whitespace around the `print` statement.

The reason for this bug could be that the function is not properly checking for the target version and handling the print statement accordingly.

To fix this bug, the function should check for the target version and adjust the output based on whether the target version is `py27` or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# Assume Grammar and TargetVersion classes are defined somewhere else
# ...

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]

```
