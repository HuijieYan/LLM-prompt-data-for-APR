The error message indicates that the test case is failing due to an "InvalidInput" exception being raised. This exception is being raised when parsing the source code related to the "print" function.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies within the "get_grammars" function. Specifically, the problem is with the condition that checks if the target versions contain Python 2. Since the error mentions Python 2-related code and "print" function, it's likely that the condition checking for Python 2 is not working as intended.

The issue may be occurring because the "is_python2" method is defined on the class, but it's being called without an instance of the class. This could lead to unexpected behavior and result in incorrect decisions about which grammar to use.

To fix the issue, it's important to pass an instance of the class to the "is_python2" method or make "is_python2" a static method. Additionally, the condition in the "get_grammars" function that checks for Python 2 compatibility should be revised to ensure it correctly identifies Python 2 code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import Grammar, pygram, TargetVersion

def is_python2() -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    # Assuming is_python2 is a static method
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, "is_python2" is assumed to be a static method and is called without an instance. The condition that checks for Python 2 compatibility has also been updated to explicitly check for the presence of TargetVersion.PY27 in the target versions set.
