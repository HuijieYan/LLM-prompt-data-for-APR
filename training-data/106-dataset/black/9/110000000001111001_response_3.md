The potential error in the function is in the condition `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition is checking if all target_versions are not Python 2 versions, and if so, it returns a specific set of Python grammars. However, the error is that the condition should be checking if any of the target_versions are Python 2 versions.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if any of the target_versions are Python 2 versions. Additionally, we need to import the necessary classes `TargetVersion`, `Grammar`, and `pygram` for the function to work.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from enum import Enum

# Define the TargetVersion and Grammar classes if not already defined
class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2

class Grammar:
    pass

# Import the necessary pygram classes if not already imported
import pygram

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, we import the necessary classes `TargetVersion`, `Grammar`, and `pygram`, and fix the condition to check if any of the target_versions are Python 2 versions as opposed to all of them.
