The error message is indicating that there is a problem with the parsing of the source code when the target version is set to py27. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the print statement in Python 2.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that checks for the Python version and determines which grammar to use for parsing the source code.

The bug occurs because the function `is_python2()` is not properly implemented or called within the `get_grammars` function to determine if the target version is Python 2. This results in the incorrect parsing of the source code and the subsequent error.

To fix the bug, the `is_python2()` function should be properly implemented to check if the target version is Python 2, and then this function should be called within the `get_grammars` function to determine which grammar to use for parsing.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from .types import TargetVersion, Grammar

# Fixed function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this fixed code, the `is_python2()` function has been replaced with a direct comparison to `TargetVersion.PY27` to determine if the target version is Python 2 or not. This change should address the bug and ensure that the correct grammar is used for parsing the source code based on the target Python version.
