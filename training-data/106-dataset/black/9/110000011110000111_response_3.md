The error message indicates that the function `lib2to3_parse` is unable to parse the source code due to an issue with the `print` statement when using `target_version=py27`.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `get_grammars`, it seems that the issue lies in the Python 2 compatibility check. The current implementation handles Python 2 compatibility by returning specific grammar rules if all target versions are Python 2. However, it does not account for the specific behavior of the print statement in Python 2.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation does not appropriately handle the Python 2 print statement when determining compatibility with Python 2.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `get_grammars` function to handle the Python 2 print statement behavior explicitly. By checking if the target versions include Python 2 and then returning the appropriate grammar rules based on the Python version, the bug can be resolved.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version is TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so return Python 2 grammar.
        return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_function]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if all target versions are Python 2 (`TargetVersion.PY27`) and return the appropriate Python 2 grammar rule. This modification ensures that the Python 2 print statement behavior is handled correctly.
