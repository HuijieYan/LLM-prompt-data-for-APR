Potential error location: The error occurs in the `get_grammars` function where it checks if the `target_versions` set contains the version for Python 2, and if so, it returns Python 2-compatible code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `is_python2` method is supposed to be a method of the class, but it is defined as a standalone function within the file. Additionally, the `pygram` module seems to be referenced but not imported in the provided code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Define the `is_python2` method as a method of the appropriate class, and make sure it returns a boolean value based on the version.
2. Import the `pygram` module and use it to obtain the Python 2 and Python 3 grammar objects.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from pygram import python_grammar, python_grammar_no_print_statement, python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement

class Grammar:
    pass  # Placeholder for Grammar class definition

class TargetVersion:
    PY27 = 2

def is_python2(version: TargetVersion) -> bool:
    return version == TargetVersion.PY27

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS  # Assuming GRAMMARS is defined elsewhere
    elif all(not is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [python_grammar]
``` 

Note: This code assumes that the `pygram` module contains definitions for `python_grammar`, `python_grammar_no_print_statement`, and `python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement`. If these are not available, appropriate replacements or imports should be used. Also, the definition of the `GRAMMARS` variable is missing and should be addressed based on the specific requirements of the code.
