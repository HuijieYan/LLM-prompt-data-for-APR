The buggy function `get_grammars` is intended to return a list of grammars based on the input `target_versions`. It checks if the `target_versions` set is empty and returns a list of grammars if it's not. However, there is a problem in the condition for checking if all versions are not Python 2 compatible.

The issue lies in the condition: `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition is checking if all the versions in `target_versions` are not Python 2 compatible, but it should be checking if any of the versions are Python 2 compatible.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if any version is Python 2 compatible. We can do this by using the `any` function instead of `all`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import TargetVersion, pygram

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected code, we replaced `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` with `any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. Now the condition properly checks if any of the versions are Python 2 compatible.
