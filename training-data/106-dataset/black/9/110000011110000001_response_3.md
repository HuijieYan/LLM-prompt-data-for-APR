1. The test case is testing Python 2 compatibility by setting the `target_versions` to {black.TargetVersion.PY27}.

2. The potential error location within the `get_grammars` function is the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition is checking if all the target versions are not Python 2.

3. The error message indicates that the code is unable to parse the "print" statement with the provided target versions, which suggests that the condition for Python 2 compatibility is not working as expected.

4. To fix the bug, the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` should be modified to accurately check for Python 2 compatibility. This can be achieved by changing the condition to check if `black.TargetVersion.PY27` is present in the `target_versions` set.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif black.TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

By making this change, the `get_grammars` function will correctly handle the Python 2 compatibility check based on the provided `target_versions`, and the error indicated in the test case should be resolved.
