Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the section where it checks for the target_versions and returns different grammars based on the condition.

Reasons for the bug: It seems that the bug is causing unnecessary whitespace to be added between the `print` and the opening parenthesis when the `target_version` is set to `py27`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The code should be modified to remove the unnecessary whitespace that is being added between the `print` and the opening parenthesis.

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[str]) -> List[str]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif "py27" in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            "pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement",
            "pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement",
        ]
    else:
        return ["pygram.python_grammar"]
```
