The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `elif` statement where it checks if all the target_versions are not Python 2. This logic is incorrect as it should only return Python 2-compatible code if Python 2 is in the target_versions.

The bug occurs because the `elif` statement is checking for the opposite condition of what is required. It should be checking if Python 2 is in the target_versions, but the current code is checking if Python 2 is not in the target_versions.

To fix the bug, we need to change the `elif` condition to check if Python 2 is in the target_versions. Then, we can return the relevant Python 2-compatible code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, return relevant Python 2-compatible code
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
