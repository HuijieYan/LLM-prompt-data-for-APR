The error occurs in the `get_grammars` function in the `black.py` file. It seems that the function is trying to determine which grammar to use based on the given target versions, and it should return a list of grammar objects based on the condition provided.

Looking at the error message, it appears that the issue is related to how the `get_grammars` function handles the target_versions parameter. The function attempts to use an Iterable but it should be using a Set.

To correct this issue, the get_grammars function needs to accept a Set of TargetVersion instances, and the if condition should check if the given version is in the set of target_versions.

Here's the corrected code for the get_grammars function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# Assuming Grammar and TargetVersion are defined elsewhere
Grammar = ...
TargetVersion = ...

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected version, we are checking if any of the target versions are equal to TargetVersion.PY27, and the function returns the appropriate list of grammar objects based on this condition.
