The error message is stemming from the fact that there is an issue with parsing the print statement when the target version is set to py27. The error is specifically related to unnecessary whitespace being added by black when applying formatting to the code.

The issue lies within the `get_grammars` function. When the function is called with the `target_versions` argument, it is not handling the `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement` and `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement` grammars correctly. As a result, the unnecessary whitespace is being added around the print function in the formatted code.

To fix this bug, the `get_grammars` function should properly handle the case when the target version is set to Python 2. It should return the appropriate grammars that are compatible with Python 2, without introducing the whitespace issue.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]
```

By returning the appropriate grammars based on the target version, the issue with unnecessary whitespace around the print statements should be resolved.
