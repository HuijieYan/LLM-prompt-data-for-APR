The error message shows that the issue is related to the parsing of the source code when using the `target_version` argument for the `black` module. The specific error is related to the formatting of the print statement when using target_version = py27.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `get_grammars` function, where the condition for Python 2-compatible code is checked. The bug is likely due to the conditional check `if not target_versions`, which is not handling the target_version PY27 correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for Python 2-compatible code does not handle the case when the target_version is specifically set to PY27. This causes the function to return an incorrect list of grammars.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for Python 2-compatible code needs to be updated to handle the case when the target_version is specifically set to PY27.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import TargetVersion, Grammar

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions or TargetVersion.PY27 in target_versions:
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected function, the conditional check for Python 2-compatible code has been updated to handle the case when the target_version is specifically set to PY27. Now it should return the correct list of grammars based on the target_versions provided.
