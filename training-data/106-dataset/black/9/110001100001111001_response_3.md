The buggy function is `get_grammars` and the error seems to be related to the `is_python2` method that is being called on the `version` object in the `all` function. 

The reason for the bug is that the `is_python2` method is being called as if it is a method of the `version` object, but it is actually a method of the class that contains this function. This means it should be called as `self.is_python2()` instead of `version.is_python2()`.

To fix the bug, we need to change `version.is_python2()` to `self.is_python2()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not self.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
