The potential error in the code is the incorrect usage of `six.moves.filter`. The lambda function inside the `filter` function is not being used correctly, and it should be using a list comprehension instead. Additionally, `PENDING` and `RUNNING` should be referenced as strings or variables, and the comparison should use `in` instead of `==`.

The lambda function is not necessary here, and the function should simply return a list of tasks that are both PENDING and RUNNING.

The corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function is:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
