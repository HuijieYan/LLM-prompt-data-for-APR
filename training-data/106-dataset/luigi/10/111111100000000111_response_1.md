Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the filter function, as it's not being used correctly. The lambda function should be used to filter out tasks with status PENDING or RUNNING, but it's not being applied to the tasks properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The filter function is not being used correctly. The lambda function should be used to filter the tasks, but it's not being applied correctly. Additionally, the comparison of the length of tasks with the number of pending tasks is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use list comprehension or the filter function correctly to filter out tasks based on their status.
2. Use the correct comparison to determine if the length of tasks is less than the number of pending tasks.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
In the corrected code, list comprehension is used to properly filter out tasks based on their status, and the comparison of the length of tasks with the number of pending tasks is corrected.
