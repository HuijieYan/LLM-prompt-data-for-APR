The error message from the test function indicates that it is not returning the expected output. The test is failing because it's expecting set{'B'} for `trivial_worker` and set{'A'} for `non_trivial_worker`. However, the function `get_pending_tasks` is not returning the expected values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks the length of tasks against the number of pending tasks. It seems to be using the wrong variable to compare the length of tasks.

The bug occurs because the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():` is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state. This comparison is incorrect and results in the wrong set of pending tasks being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to remove this comparison and directly return the pending tasks from the state. Additionally, we should remove the input parameter `state` from the function since it is not being used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    """
    return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks)
```
