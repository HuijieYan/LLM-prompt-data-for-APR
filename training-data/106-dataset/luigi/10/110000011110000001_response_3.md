Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `get_pending_tasks` method. The method is not correctly filtering out the PENDING and RUNNING tasks from `self.tasks`.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the lambda function used with `six.moves.filter` is not correctly filtering the tasks based on their status.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the lambda function to properly filter the tasks based on their status.
2. Ensure that the `status` attribute is accessible within the lambda function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function for get_pending_tasks
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = "PENDING"
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"
    
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
