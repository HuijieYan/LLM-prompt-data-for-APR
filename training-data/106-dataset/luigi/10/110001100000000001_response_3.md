Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():`. The `state.num_pending_tasks()` may not be a valid function or the comparison logic may be incorrect.

Reason behind the Bug:
The comparison logic in the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, but the method `state.num_pending_tasks()` is not a valid method, which can lead to an AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if there is a method `num_pending_tasks` available in the `state` class. If it is available, then use that method to get the number of pending tasks.
2. If the `state` class does not have the `num_pending_tasks` method, consider refactoring the logic to get the number of pending tasks from the `state` object.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
