The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected set of pending task IDs does not match the actual result. The test is expecting {'B'} but getting {'A'}.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect use of the lambda function with the `filter` method. The lambda function is not correctly filtering the pending and running tasks from the `self.tasks`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the lambda function used with the `filter` method does not properly filter the tasks based on their status.

To fix the bug, we can use a list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status. Also, the state object is not needed as an argument for this function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    """
    return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
```

By using a list comprehension, we can filter the tasks based on their status and return the correct list of pending (and running) tasks for the worker.
