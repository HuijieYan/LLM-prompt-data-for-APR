# Buggy function

The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is designed to return PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for the worker. It takes in the `self` reference and the `state` as parameters.

## Error
The function seems to have multiple issues:
1. It is using the `len` function on `self.tasks`, which is a set, leading to a type error.
2. It is referencing `PENDING` and `RUNNING` without importing them or defining them within the function scope.

## Fix
1. Use the `in` operator to check if the length of `self.tasks` is less than the number of pending tasks in `state`.
2. Import or define `PENDING` and `RUNNING` properly.

## Corrected code

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        pending_running_tasks = set()
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.status in {'PENDING', 'RUNNING'}:
                pending_running_tasks.add(task)
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
