The error message indicates that the test is failing because the 'A' task is expected to be pending for the 'NON_TRIVIAL' worker, but it is not. This suggests that the `get_pending_tasks` method is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the `get_pending_tasks` method is the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()`. It seems that it is incorrectly comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is not accurately checking for the number of pending tasks for the worker. It is possible that the comparison is meant to check if the worker has fewer tasks than the total number of pending tasks, but the current implementation does not reflect this accurately.

To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` should be replaced. It might be better to compare the number of pending tasks for the worker with the total number of pending tasks in the state.

The corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

In this correction, the method iterates over `self.tasks` and adds tasks with status 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING' to the `pending_tasks` list. Then, it returns the list of pending tasks. This approach avoids the issue with the original code and provides a more accurate implementation.
