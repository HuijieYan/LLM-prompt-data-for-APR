Potential Error:
The error might occur in the `get_pending_tasks` function where it checks the length of `self.tasks` and calls `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because `self.tasks` is an array but is being treated as a set. Additionally, `state.num_pending_tasks()` is called without the necessary context to determine the pending tasks.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by modifying the way `self.tasks` is handled and using a different approach to determine the pending tasks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    
    if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
