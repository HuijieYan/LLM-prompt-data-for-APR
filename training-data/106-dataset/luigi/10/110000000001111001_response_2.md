The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to apply a filter using a lambda function on the `self.tasks` set, but the filter syntax and logic are incorrect. Additionally, the else condition seems to be calling a method `state.get_pending_tasks()`, but the `state` variable is not a class method and is likely causing a runtime error as well.

The reason for the bug is that the filter syntax is incorrect and the else condition is trying to call a method on an object that does not exist.

To fix the bug, you can use a list comprehension to filter the tasks and return the pending tasks. You should also change the else condition to return the pending tasks using the state object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
