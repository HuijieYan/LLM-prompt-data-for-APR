Potential Error Location: The buggy function is trying to filter tasks based on their status, but it's not doing so correctly.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The buggy function is not correctly filtering the tasks based on their status. The lambda function inside the `six.moves.filter` is not being used correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, you can use a list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status. Also, the `len(self.tasks)` condition should be checked against the number of pending tasks rather than the number of tasks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
