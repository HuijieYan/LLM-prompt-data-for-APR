Potential error location: The `get_pending_tasks` function in the provided code is not utilizing the `state` parameter properly. It should use the `state` to get pending tasks instead of trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is incorrectly comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, and it is not using the `state` parameter as intended to retrieve pending tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function should be modified to use the `state` parameter to get pending tasks instead of trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks. It also should handle both the PENDING and RUNNING tasks as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task_id, task in self.tasks.items():
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task_id)
    
    return pending_tasks.union(state.get_pending_tasks(self.id))
```

This corrected function properly retrieves PENDING and RUNNING tasks from `self.tasks` and also includes the pending tasks from the `state` using the `get_pending_tasks` method.
