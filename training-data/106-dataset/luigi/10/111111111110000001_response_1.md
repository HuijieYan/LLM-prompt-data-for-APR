Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` test function on the line `self.assertEqual({'B'}, self.get_pending_ids(trivial_worker, scheduler_state))`. This indicates that the `get_pending_ids` function is returning 'A' when it should only return 'B' because 'C' and 'D' are in the 'DONE' state.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the logic in the `get_pending_tasks` function is not correctly filtering out tasks that are in the 'DONE' state.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `get_pending_tasks` function to correctly filter out tasks that are in the 'DONE' state. This can be achieved by checking the status of each task and filtering out tasks with status 'DONE'.


Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
            
    return pending_tasks
```
