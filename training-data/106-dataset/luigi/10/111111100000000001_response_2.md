Potential error location: The if condition is comparing the length of self.tasks with the result of state.num_pending_tasks(). This comparison may not be valid as the state.num_pending_tasks() does not necessarily represent the number of pending tasks for the worker.

Reason for the bug: The comparison in the if condition does not accurately reflect the number of pending tasks for the worker. It should directly check the pending tasks for the worker, rather than comparing lengths or using state.num_pending_tasks().

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the if condition to check the actual pending tasks for the worker using self.tasks.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
