The potential error in the buggy function is in the `get_pending_tasks` method. It seems that the method is trying to return tasks based on the length of `self.tasks` compared to the number of pending tasks in the `state`. However, the logic within the if statement is incorrect, and there are also issues with the use of lambda and filtering.

The lambda and filtering logic in the return statement is incorrect, as lambda is unnecessary and the filtering logic needs to be fixed.

It looks like there is a confusion with the usage of `state` and `self.tasks`. The method is trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, which seems incorrect.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary use of lambda and fix the conditional logic to properly compare the size of `self.tasks` and the number of pending tasks in the `state`. Also, the filtering logic needs to be fixed to return the pending and running tasks from `self.tasks`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
