The error message indicates that the test is failing because it is expecting only `'B'` to be in the set of pending tasks for the trivial worker, but it also contains `'A'`.

The potential error location is within the `get_pending_tasks` function of the `Worker` class, specifically in the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():`. This condition is not correctly comparing the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks.

The bug is occurring because the comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is not correct. It is only checking the length of the tasks belonging to the worker and comparing it with the total number of pending tasks. It should only be comparing the number of pending tasks for the specific worker with the length of the tasks belonging to that worker.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be changed to `len(self.tasks) < len(state.get_pending_tasks(self))`. This ensures that the comparison is between the number of tasks for the worker and the number of pending tasks for that worker.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < len(state.get_pending_tasks(self)):
        return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING],
                                self.tasks)
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self)
```
