Potential error location: The error might be caused by the use of a lambda function with `six.moves.filter` and the comparison of `task.status` with `[PENDING, RUNNING]`.

Reasons for the bug: The code is using `six.moves.filter` with a lambda function, which is not the correct way of filtering tasks. Additionally, `PENDING` and `RUNNING` may not be defined, and there is a mismatch with `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a list comprehension to filter tasks based on their status.
2. Pass the correct values to `state.num_pending_tasks()` and `state.get_pending_tasks()`.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
