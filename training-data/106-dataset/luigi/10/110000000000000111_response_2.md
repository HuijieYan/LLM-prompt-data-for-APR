Potential error location: 
The bug is in the `if` statement. The function is supposed to return PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for the worker, but the condition `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is comparing the length of self.tasks with the number of pending tasks in the state. This condition does not serve the intended purpose.

Reasons for the bug:
The comparison in the if statement does not correctly determine if there are any pending or running tasks for the worker. Additionally, the lambda function used with `six.moves.filter` is not being used correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a proper condition to check for PENDING and RUNNING tasks in the worker's task list.
2. Use a proper filter function to filter the tasks based on their status.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```
