The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` checks the pending tasks for two workers, 'TRIVIAL' and 'NON_TRIVIAL'. It expects the set of pending task IDs for each worker by calling the method `get_pending_ids`. However, the error message indicates that the assertion fails for the 'TRIVIAL' worker, as it expected only the task 'B' to be pending but found 'A' as well.

The potential error location within the `get_pending_tasks` function is the conditional statement that checks the length of `self.tasks` against the number of pending tasks in the `state`. 

The bug likely occurs because the function does not correctly filter the pending and running tasks based on the worker's id and status. It also seems to be using an incorrect lambda function to filter the tasks.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to correctly filter the pending and running tasks for the worker based on their id and the status of the tasks. Additionally, we should explicitly check for the worker's id and filter the tasks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in state.get_tasks_by_worker(self.id):
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task.id)
    return pending_tasks
```
