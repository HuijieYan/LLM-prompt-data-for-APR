The potential error in the provided code is the incorrect implementation of the `get_pending_tasks` function within the `Worker` class. The function takes two parameters, `self` and `state`, but in the implementation, it is only utilizing the `state` parameter to check the number of pending tasks and fetch the pending tasks from the state. However, the `self` parameter is not being utilized, and the comparison of `len(self.tasks)` with `state.num_pending_tasks()` seems to be incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that `self.tasks` seems to be referencing an attribute within the `Worker` class, but the code does not provide any definition or initialization of this attribute. Additionally, the use of `six.moves.filter` also seems problematic, as it doesn't match the standard Python filter syntax.

To fix the bug, the `get_pending_tasks` function should only take `self` as the parameter, as it can access the `state` internally within the `Worker` class. It should then use `state.num_pending_tasks()` to check for the number of pending tasks and return the pending tasks using an appropriate method to filter the tasks.

The corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function within the `Worker` class is as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    num_pending = state.num_pending_tasks()
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]][:num_pending]
    return pending_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we are using list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status (PENDING or RUNNING), and then we are returning the pending tasks based on the number of pending tasks retrieved from the state.
