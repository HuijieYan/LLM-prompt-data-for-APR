The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` is checking for the pending tasks for workers with different statuses (PENDING and DONE). However, it seems that the test is calling a function `get_pending_ids()` which is not provided in the code. It appears that there is a mix-up in the function names.

Looking at the provided code, the issue seems to be with the `get_pending_tasks` function in the `Worker` class. The function is designed to get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for the worker, but the logic inside the function to filter out the pending tasks seems incorrect. It is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, and this comparison seems to be flawed.

The buggy function seems to have an incorrect logic for checking pending tasks. It is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, and if it's less, it returns a filtered list based on `task.status`, otherwise, it returns `state.get_pending_tasks()`.

A possible way to fix this bug is to directly use `state.get_pending_tasks()` to obtain the pending tasks for the worker, eliminating the need for comparing the lengths of different task lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

This fix removes the unnecessary comparison and directly returns the pending tasks from the state, ensuring that the correct pending tasks are obtained for the worker based on the state.
