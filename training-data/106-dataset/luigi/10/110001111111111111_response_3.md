The error message suggests that the set comparison is failing, and it's expecting the pending task 'B' but getting the completed task 'A'.

Looking at the function `get_pending_tasks`, the problem seems to be in the statement:
```python
if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
```
This condition is comparing the length of the `self.tasks` set with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`. However, it should be comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks for the worker.

The current condition doesn't consider which tasks are actually pending or running. It should be distinguishing between pending and running tasks and checking their count against the worker's tasks. Also, the return types for the if and else blocks don't match.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = filter(lambda task: task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING'], self.tasks)
    
    if len(pending_running_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
In this corrected code, we first filter the worker's tasks to get the pending and running tasks. Then, we compare the count of pending and running tasks with the number of pending tasks obtained from the worker's state.

This should address the issue and perform the expected comparison for pending tasks.
