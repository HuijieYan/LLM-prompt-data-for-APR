The bug seems to be in the logic of the `get_pending_tasks` function. It's trying to filter out tasks based on their status and the length of self.tasks, but it's not taking into account the state.num_pending_tasks() value for some reason. Additionally, the return state.get_pending_tasks() is calling the same function, which seems incorrect.

It appears that the intention of the code is to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the `num_pending_tasks` from the `state` object. If the length of `self.tasks` is less than the `num_pending_tasks`, then it filters tasks based on status. 

To fix the bug, the function should check if the length of `self.tasks` is less than `state.num_pending_tasks()` and then apply the filter. If not, it should return the `state.get_pending_tasks()` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
