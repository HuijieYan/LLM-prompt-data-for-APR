The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` has the following issues:
1. The function has two different function signatures, which should not be the case. The first signature takes `self` and `state` as parameters, while the second signature takes only `self`.
2. The implementation of the function is incorrect. It tries to filter tasks based on their status, but the logic is flawed.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The function has conflicting function signatures, leading to confusion as to which function is being called.
2. The logic to filter tasks based on their status is incorrect and may not produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Remove the duplicated function definitions and keep the one with both `self` and `state` as parameters, as this seems to be the intended signature.
2. Correct the logic to filter tasks based on their status, ensuring that it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the tasks of the worker and check each task's status. If the status is either PENDING or RUNNING, we add the task to the list of pending tasks. Finally, we return the list of pending tasks.
