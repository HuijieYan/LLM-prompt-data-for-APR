Potential error location: The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is trying to call `state.num_pending_tasks()` which would result in an AttributeError as `num_pending_tasks` is not a method of the `state` object.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is attempting to call a method `num_pending_tasks` on the `state` object, but this method does not exist in the `state` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. If the `num_pending_tasks` method is supposed to be a method of the `state` object, then it needs to be implemented in the `state` class.
2. If the intention was to call the `num_pending_tasks` method of the `Worker` class, then the `state` object should be replaced with `self`.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < self.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
