The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` from `scheduler_test.py` is comparing the result of the `get_pending_ids` method with the expected value `{'B'}` for the `trivial_worker`. However, the test is failing with the error message indicating an AssertionError, as the expected set `{'B'}` does not match the actual set `{'A'}`.

The potential error location is identified within the `get_pending_tasks` method of the buggy function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is likely incorrect as it compares the length of `self.tasks` directly with the number of pending tasks in the state, which may lead to incorrect results.
2. The lambda function `lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]` used with `six.moves.filter` seems to be incorrect as it filters the tasks based on their status, but the condition may not be correctly capturing only the pending and running tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of checking the length of `self.tasks` directly, a more appropriate approach might involve iterating through `self.tasks` and checking the status of each task to ensure only pending and running tasks are included in the result.
2. Using a filter function that checks the status of tasks more accurately will help to correctly identify pending and running tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

By using the corrected approach, the `get_pending_tasks` method now correctly iterates through the tasks associated with the worker and returns a set of pending and running tasks.
