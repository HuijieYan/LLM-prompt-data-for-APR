The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected set {'B'} is not equal to the actual set {'A'}. This suggests that the 'get_pending_ids' method is returning the wrong set of pending task IDs for the trivial_worker.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the conditional statement:

```python
if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
    return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks)
else:
    return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

The 'self.tasks' does not seem to be correctly utilized in the conditional statement which leads to the incorrect return of pending tasks for the worker.

The reason behind the bug is that the condition `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is not correctly checking for the pending tasks for the worker. 

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use the 'self.tasks' to filter out the tasks that are PENDING or RUNNING, and return them as the pending tasks for the worker. Additionally, it seems that the 'state' parameter may not be needed in this function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task.task_id for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    return set(pending_tasks)
```
