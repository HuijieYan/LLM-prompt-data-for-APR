The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` has two conflicting function signatures and also uses an if-else statement to return different values based on the length of `self.tasks`. 

The error occurs because the function is defined twice with the same name but different parameters, which is not allowed in Python. Additionally, the function is checking the length of `self.tasks` to decide whether to return `self.tasks` or `state.get_pending_tasks()`. It's likely that this is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we can remove one of the duplicate function definitions, and consolidate the logic of the two functions into a single function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state=None):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    If the state is provided, return tasks based on its `num_pending_tasks` method. 
    Otherwise, return the tasks directly from the worker.
    """
    if state:
        return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks)
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

This new implementation accepts an optional `state` parameter. If `state` is provided, it returns tasks based on its `num_pending_tasks` method. Otherwise, it returns the tasks directly from the worker. This implementation resolves the issue of conflicting function signatures and consolidates the logic into a single function.
