The potential error location within the function is the comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()`. This comparison is not appropriate for getting the pending and running tasks for the worker. Additionally, the lambda function `lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]` is not being used correctly with the `six.moves.filter` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison is trying to use the length of `self.tasks` to determine the number of pending tasks, which is not correct. Additionally, the lambda function with `six.moves.filter` is not being used correctly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the comparison of lengths and use the state to get the pending tasks directly. Also, correct the usage of the lambda function with `six.moves.filter` to filter the tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    return pending_tasks + state.get_pending_tasks()
```
