Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is the use of the `six.moves.filter` function. This function is not suitable for the given task as it filters the tasks based on a condition and returns the filtered tasks. However, in this case, the intention is to filter the tasks based on their status and return the filtered tasks.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `six.moves.filter` function is used incorrectly. It expects a function as the first argument and an iterable as the second argument. However, in the given code, the lambda function is used, but the lambda function should return a boolean value to filter the tasks.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to use list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status and return the filtered tasks.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
