The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` creates a scenario where tasks with different states (PENDING and DONE) are added to the scheduler. It then compares the expected pending tasks for two specific workers and their corresponding worker IDs.

The error message states that the `self.assertEqual` comparison failed because the set of pending tasks for the trivial worker does not match the expected set. Instead of the expected value 'B', the actual value returned from the `get_pending_ids` method is 'A'.

The potential error location is within the `get_pending_tasks` method of the `Worker` class. It seems that the logic inside the method is incorrect, leading to the wrong calculation of pending tasks.

The reason for the bug seems to be the conditional check inside the `get_pending_tasks` method. Specifically, when comparing the length of `self.tasks` with `state.num_pending_tasks()`, the comparison logic may not reflect the actual state of pending tasks accurately.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the conditional logic and data retrieval methods inside the `get_pending_tasks` method. It may be necessary to consider the actual states of the tasks and ensure that the comparison is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    # Assuming self.tasks is a set
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task)
    
    return pending_tasks
```
