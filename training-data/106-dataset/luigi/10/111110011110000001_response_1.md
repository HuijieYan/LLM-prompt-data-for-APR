The error message indicates that the test case is failing because it is expecting one value in the set ('B'), but it is actually getting a different value ('A'). This indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual results.

The potential error location within the `get_pending_tasks` function is the logic used for filtering tasks based on their status. The bug is likely occurring in the `if` statement where it compares the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the `state`. The condition `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is likely causing the function to return the wrong set of tasks.

The problem lies in the condition `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()`. This condition does not accurately represent the comparison needed to filter pending (and running) tasks for the worker.

To fix the bug, the comparison needs to be based on the number of PENDING and RUNNING tasks for the worker in the `state`, rather than comparing it with the length of `self.tasks`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    if len(pending_running_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison is made between the number of PENDING and RUNNING tasks in `self.tasks` and the number of pending tasks in the `state`, and the list of pending and running tasks is returned accordingly.
