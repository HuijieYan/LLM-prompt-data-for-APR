Potential Error:
The bug occurs because the `get_pending_tasks` method is defined twice with different signatures. The second definition will override the first, causing issues when the method is called with different parameters.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_pending_tasks` method is defined twice with different signatures, leading to ambiguity and potential erroneous behavior when the method is called.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove one of the definitions of the `get_pending_tasks` method to eliminate the ambiguity.
2. Modify the method to handle both cases based on the parameters passed.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state=None):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You can pass in the state for optimization reasons if needed.
    """
    if state is not None and len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        # Assuming that state is an instance of the class containing num_pending_tasks method
        return self.num_pending_tasks()
```
