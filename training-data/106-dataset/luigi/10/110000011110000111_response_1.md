The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected set is {'B'} but the actual result is 'A'.

As for the buggy function `get_pending_tasks`, the issue lies in the use of the lambda function in combination with the `six.moves.filter` method. The lambda function is not correctly filtering the tasks based on their status.

The reason for the bug is that the lambda function is not returning the expected set of pending and running tasks. Additionally, the conditions for determining the pending and running tasks are not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, remove the lambda function and use a list comprehension to filter the tasks. Also, implement the conditions to check for PENDING and RUNNING status correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = "PENDING"
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"
    
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

With the corrected function, the tasks are filtered based on their status, and the conditions for determining the pending and running tasks are correctly implemented.
