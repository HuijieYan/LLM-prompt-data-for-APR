Potential error location: The error in the function lies in the line where it compares the length of self.tasks with the result of state.num_pending_tasks().

Reason behind the bug: The comparison is incorrect because it should not be comparing the length of self.tasks with num_pending_tasks. Instead, it should be comparing with the result of calling state.num_pending_tasks().

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Replace 'len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()' with 'len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks(self)' to correctly call the num_pending_tasks() method of the state object.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks(self):
        return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING],
                                self.tasks)
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
