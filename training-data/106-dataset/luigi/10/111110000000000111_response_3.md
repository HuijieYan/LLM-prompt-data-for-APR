Potential error location: 
The potential error lies in the use of `six.moves.filter` and the comparison `task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]`. It seems that the intention is to filter the tasks based on their status, but the implementation is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The use of `six.moves.filter` seems incorrect, and the comparison `task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]` should be done with the correct values for `PENDING` and `RUNNING`, but they are not defined in the given code snippet. Additionally, the comparison logic seems flawed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a list comprehension or a lambda function with a filter for the desired task status.
2. Define the `PENDING` and `RUNNING` values appropriately and use them in the comparison.
3. Ensure that the correct filtering logic is implemented to return the pending and running tasks based on their status.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = "PENDING"
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"

    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        pending_running_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
