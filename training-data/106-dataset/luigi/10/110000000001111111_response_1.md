The potential error in the provided function is in the `if` condition. The comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` compares the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`, which doesn't seem to be the intended behavior.

Additionally, the `filter` function in the return statement is used incorrectly, as it expects a function and an iterable as arguments.

The bug occurs because the `if` condition is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state, which may not be a correct comparison to determine if there are pending tasks for this worker. Additionally, the `filter` function is not used properly.

To fix the bug:
1. The comparison should be based on the tasks themselves, not their length, to determine whether there are pending tasks for this worker.
2. Use the `filter` function with a lambda function to filter the tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = filter(lambda task: task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING'], self.tasks)
    if len(pending_tasks) > 0:
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In this corrected code:
- We use the `filter` function to filter the tasks based on their status being 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING'.
- Then we check if there are any pending tasks in the `pending_tasks` list. If there are, we return those tasks; if not, we return the pending tasks from the state.
