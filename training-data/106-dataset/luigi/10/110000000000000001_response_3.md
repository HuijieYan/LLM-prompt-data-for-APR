Potential error location: The error in the function seems to be in the `if` condition where it is checking if the number of tasks is less than the number of pending tasks in the state.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the comparison in the `if` condition is not checking for the correct condition. Additionally, the use of `six.moves.filter` may not be appropriate for this context.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `filter` function directly instead of `six.moves.filter`.
2. Correct the comparison in the `if` condition to check if the number of pending tasks is greater than the number of tasks.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if state.num_pending_tasks() > len(self.tasks):
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
