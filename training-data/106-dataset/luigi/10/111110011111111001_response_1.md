The bug is likely within the logic of the `get_pending_tasks` method. The function is intended to return a set of pending tasks for a given worker. However, the logic of the function seems to be faulty, as it is not considering the status of tasks correctly.

The error message from the test case also indicates that the assertion is failing because the pending IDs are not being returned correctly. This suggests that the function is not accurately identifying the pending tasks.

The buggy section of the code seems to be the conditional statement that compares the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks from the `state`. It is not correctly filtering the pending (and running) tasks based on their status.

To fix the bug, the function should properly filter the pending tasks based on their status. This can be achieved by iterating through `self.tasks` and checking the status of each task.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

This corrected function iterates through `self.tasks`, checks the status of each task, and adds the pending (and running) tasks to the `pending_tasks` set. This should resolve the bug and return the correct set of pending tasks for the worker.
