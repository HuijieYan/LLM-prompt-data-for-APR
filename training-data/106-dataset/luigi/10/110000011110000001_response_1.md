1. The test case 'test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks' is checking for the pending tasks for workers with different statuses. However, the error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected pending task 'B' is not matching the actual pending task 'A'.

2. The potential error location is in the 'get_pending_tasks' function as it is responsible for returning the pending tasks for a given worker.

3. The bug occurs because the 'get_pending_tasks' function is not correctly filtering out the pending and running tasks for the worker. Instead, it is returning all pending tasks from the state, which leads to incorrect results when compared with the actual pending tasks in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the 'get_pending_tasks' function should filter out the pending and running tasks from the worker's tasks and return them. Also, the function should use appropriate comparison for task statuses (e.g., check if the status is 'PENDING' and 'RUNNING').

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'get_pending_tasks' function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```
