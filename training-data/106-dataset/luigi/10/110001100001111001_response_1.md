The error in the provided code is likely due to the comparison between the length of `self.tasks` and the number of pending tasks in the state. The function is trying to filter tasks based on this comparison, but there are a few issues.

The function is defined with the same name and signature as `get_pending_tasks(self)`. This will cause an error due to method overloading or overshadowing.

The comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is attempting to compare the length of a set (`self.tasks`) with the result of a method call on the state object. Since `state.num_pending_tasks()` is a valid method, this does not raise a syntax error, but it might not be the intended method to retrieve the number of pending tasks.

To fix the code, the function should be modified to correctly filter the pending tasks based on the state, without using the comparison that might not accurately represent the pending tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we iterate over `self.tasks` and filter out the tasks that have a status of 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING'. We return the list of pending tasks. This implementation does not rely on the comparison with the number of pending tasks in the state, but instead directly filters the tasks based on their status.
