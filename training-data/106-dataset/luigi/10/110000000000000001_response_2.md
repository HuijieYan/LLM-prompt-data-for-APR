Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is within the conditional statement. The condition to check if the number of tasks in the worker is less than the number of pending tasks in the state doesn't seem to be directly related to the intended functionality of getting pending tasks.

Reasons for the Bug:
The conditional statement is not correctly handling the logic for retrieving pending tasks. It should directly focus on obtaining the pending tasks for the worker, rather than comparing the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks in the state.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary comparison of the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks in the state.
2. Instead, directly filter and return the pending and running tasks from the worker's tasks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
```
