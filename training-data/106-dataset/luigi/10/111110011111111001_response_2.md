The error occurs in the `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` test case when trying to assert that for the trivial worker, the pending task IDs should only contain 'B', which is the pending task. However, it also contains 'A' which is incorrect, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error in the problematic function is the logic within the `get_pending_tasks` method. The `get_pending_tasks` method is not correctly filtering the pending and running tasks based on their status in the if condition.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the if condition is not correctly filtering the pending and running tasks based on their status. Additionally, there is usage of `six.moves.filter` which is not suitable for filtering sets.

To fix the bug:
1. The `if` condition should correctly check for the status of tasks and filter them accordingly.
2. Replace `six.moves.filter` with a suitable method to filter sets.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_and_running_tasks = {task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']}
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_and_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
