Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the if condition where it checks whether the length of self.tasks is less than the number of pending tasks in the state. The comparison using num_pending_tasks() is not appropriate and the usage of six.moves.filter() is incorrect.

Reason behind the Bug:
The comparison using num_pending_tasks() is incorrect and the usage of six.moves.filter() is not suitable for this scenario. This is leading to an incorrect logic flow and causing the function to fail.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct method to get the number of pending tasks from the state.
2. Filter the tasks based on their status using list comprehension instead of using six.moves.filter().

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
