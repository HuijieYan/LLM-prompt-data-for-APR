1. The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` is trying to check for the pending tasks for different workers in the scheduler. It expects that only task B should be pending for the worker 'TRIVIAL', and only task A should be pending for the worker 'NON_TRIVIAL'.

2. The potential error location is in the `get_pending_tasks` function in the faulty part of the code.

3. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect implementation of the `get_pending_tasks` function. It is using `lambda` and `six.moves.filter` in a way that doesn't make sense for the context of the function.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to directly iterate over the tasks and check the status for pending and running tasks. Since the function is already receiving the state as a parameter, there's no need to call `state.get_pending_tasks()`.

5. Corrected `get_pending_tasks` function:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task)
    return pending_tasks
```
