The error message `AssertionError: Items in the second set but not the first: 'A'` indicates that the `get_pending_ids` method is returning 'A' when it should be 'B'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():`. This condition is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks in the state. The first case executes the `else` block, implying that `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is false, which means there are enough tasks in `self.tasks` to proceed inside the `if` block.

The bug occurs because the intended comparison is to check if there are any pending or running tasks in `self.tasks`, not to compare its length with the number of pending tasks in the state.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be modified to check for any pending or running tasks in `self.tasks`. Additionally, the lambda function inside `six.moves.filter` should be modified to correctly filter tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if any(task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING'] for task in self.tasks):
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self.id)
```
