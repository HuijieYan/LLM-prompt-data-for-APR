Potential error location: The lambda function being used with `six.moves.filter` may not work as intended. 

Reasons behind the bug: The lambda function is not properly used with `six.moves.filter` and may not filter the tasks as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using a lambda function with `six.moves.filter`, we can use a list comprehension to properly filter the tasks.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
