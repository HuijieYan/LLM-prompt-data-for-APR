The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `prune` method twice with different signatures. This causes confusion and ambiguity in the code, resulting in the wrong method being called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is due to the duplicate method names within the class `CentralPlannerScheduler`. Python allows method overloading, but it's important to have a unique method signature for each method.

To fix the bug, we can rename one of the `prune` methods to a different name, or we can remove one of them if it's not being used.

Here's the corrected code with one of the `prune` methods renamed to `prune_tasks`:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def prune(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def prune_tasks(self):  # Renamed from the original duplicate method name
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
    
        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()
    
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
    
```
