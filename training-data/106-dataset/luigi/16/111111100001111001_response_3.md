The bug in the given code lies in the `prune` method within the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The `prune` method is trying to remove workers and tasks based on certain conditions. However, in the implementation provided, it is incorrectly handling the `remove` and `retry` parameters for tasks, and it is not using the correct worker and task properties to get the necessary information for pruning.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the correct properties of the worker and task objects to assess whether a worker or task needs to be removed. For example, use `worker.id` instead of `worker` and use `task.remove` and `task.retry` where necessary.
2. Modify the conditions for checking `worker.prune` and `self._state.prune` to use the correct comparisons.
3. Ensure that the correct functions are called from the `self._state` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def prune(self):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.id not in self._state.get_assistants():  # Check if worker is not an assistant
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
    
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.remove is not None and task.retry is not None:
                self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
                if task.remove >= self._config.remove_delay and task.retry >= self._config.retry_delay:
                    remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
