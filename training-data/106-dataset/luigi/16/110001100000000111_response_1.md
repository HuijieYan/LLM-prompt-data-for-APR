Potential error location: The issue is likely to be in the `prune` function where it is failing to retry the failed tasks.

Reason behind the bug: The `prune` function is not handling the retry of failed tasks correctly. It is failing to check for the retry configurations and retrying the eligible tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the retry configurations for the failed tasks.
2. If the task is eligible for retry, re-queue the task for execution.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.failed and task.retry_enabled:  # Check if task is failed and eligible for retry
                # Re-queue the task for execution
                task.reset()  # Reset the task to initial state for retry
            else:
                self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)  # Handling failed tasks

            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for the retry configurations of the failed tasks. If the task is failed and eligible for retry, we reset the task to its initial state to re-queue it for execution. If the task is not eligible for retry, we handle it as before.
