1. The test case is checking the status of a task after a certain amount of time has passed. It expects the status to change from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds. However, the assertion fails because the actual status is still 'FAILED'.
2. The potential error location is within the `prune` function where the task status is being checked and updated.
3. The bug occurs because the `prune` function does not handle the retry logic for failed tasks that are eligible for retry. As a result, the task status remains "FAILED" instead of being retried after a certain amount of time.
4. The bug can be fixed by implementing the retry logic for failed tasks in the `prune` function. This involves checking if the task is eligible for retry, updating its status to "PENDING" after a certain amount of time has passed, and retrying the task using appropriate mechanisms.
5. Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks:
            if self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
            elif task.status == 'FAILED' and task.is_eligible_for_retry():  # Assuming there is a method is_eligible_for_retry() to check retry eligibility
                if task.ready_for_retry():  # Assuming there is a method ready_for_retry() to check if task is ready for retry
                    task.update_status('PENDING')  # Assuming there is a method update_status() to update task status
                    task.reset_retry_count()  # Assuming there is a method reset_retry_count() to reset retry count
                    self._state.retry_task(task)  # Assuming there is a method retry_task() to retry the task

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
