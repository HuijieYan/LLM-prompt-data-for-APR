The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The function appears to be incorrectly handling the retry and removal logic for failed tasks.

The bug occurs because the `prune` method is not correctly iterating over the failed tasks and retrying them if they are eligible for retry. Additionally, it is not setting the remove delay for failed tasks correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `prune` method to correctly handle the retry and removal logic for failed tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
          
        # Fix for retry and remove delay for failed tasks
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.retry > 0:
            # Decrement the retry count and update the remove delay
            task.retry -= 1
            task.remove = self._config.remove_delay

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this corrected code, we handle the retry and remove delay for failed tasks by decrementing the retry count and updating the remove delay before inactivating the tasks.

This should ensure that failed tasks are correctly retried if they are eligible for retry and that the remove delay is updated accordingly.
