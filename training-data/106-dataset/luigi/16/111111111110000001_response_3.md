The error seems to be related to the task status not being updated properly.

After analyzing the function `prune` from the class `CentralPlannerScheduler`, it seems that the issue could be with the logic for failing the dead worker task and pruning the tasks. The code might not be correctly handling the task status updates.

The reason for the bug could be that the status of the task is not being updated correctly in the `fail_dead_worker_task` and `prune` methods. This is causing the test case to fail because the status of the task is not transitioning from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, as expected.

To fix the bug, I would suggest the following approach:
- Review and update the logic in the `fail_dead_worker_task` and `prune` methods to ensure that the task status is updated correctly.
- Verify that the logic for updating the task status after a certain period of time is correctly implemented.

Here is the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.prune(self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
