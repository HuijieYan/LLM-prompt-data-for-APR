The issue seems to be with the `prune` method, specifically in the section where it checks for the availability of assistant workers and necessary tasks. It looks like the method might be incorrectly assigning values to `necessary_tasks` and not handling the `remove` attribute in the `task` object properly.

The bug occurs because the `remove` attribute of the `task` object is not being handled properly, and the `necessary_tasks` is being incorrectly assigned. This causes the assistant workers to never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `prune` method to correctly handle the `remove` attribute in the `task` object and properly assign the `necessary_tasks`.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With this corrected code, the `prune` method should now properly handle the `remove` attribute in the `task` object and correctly assign the `necessary_tasks`. This should address the issue of assistant workers not retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
