Potential Error Location: The potential error location within the code is when trying to get the necessary tasks for pruning. If there are no assistant_ids, the necessary_tasks is being set to an empty tuple, which could cause issues when comparing with task.id later in the code.

Reasons behind the Bug: When there are no assistant_ids, the necessary_tasks is being set to an empty tuple, which could lead to unexpected behavior when comparing task ids later in the code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check for the presence of assistant_ids before setting the necessary_tasks.
2. Use a conditional statement to handle the case when assistant_ids is empty.

Corrected Code:
```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
