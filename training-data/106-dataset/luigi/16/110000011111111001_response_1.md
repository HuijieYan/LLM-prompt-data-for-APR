The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' is not changing from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' as expected after 100 seconds. This suggests that the `prune` function, which is responsible for changing the status of tasks, is not functioning correctly.

Upon analyzing the `prune` function, it is observed that the "remove" attribute of the task is not being set to the correct value. In the buggy function, the "remove" value of the task is being set to 1000. However, in the expected output, the "remove" value is expected to be set to None.

This inconsistency in the "remove" attribute could be a potential cause for the task status not changing as expected.

To fix this issue, the "remove" attribute of the task should be set to None when it does not have any workers assigned to it. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for the presence of workers before setting the "remove" attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.workers:
                task.remove = self._config.remove_delay
            else:
                task.remove = None
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

By implementing this change, the "remove" attribute will be appropriately set based on the presence of workers, allowing the `prune` function to function as expected and resolving the issue with the test case.
