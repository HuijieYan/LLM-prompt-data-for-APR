The potential error in the `prune` function is that it's trying to call methods using `self._state` without initializing or passing the `state` as a parameter to the function. This could lead to a 'NoneType' error.

To fix this, we need to make sure that the `state` is initialized or passed as a parameter to the `prune` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self, state, config, logger):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in state.get_active_tasks():
        state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and state.prune(task, config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
``` 

In this corrected code, we have added the `state`, `config`, and `logger` as parameters to the `prune` function to ensure that it has access to the necessary methods and attributes.
