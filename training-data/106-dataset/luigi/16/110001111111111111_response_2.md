The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` adds a task with the status `FAILED` and an assistant worker, and then checks if the status changes to `PENDING` after 100 seconds. However, the test fails because the status remains `FAILED`.

The bug is likely in the `prune` function where it doesn't properly re-enable failed tasks. The code doesn't seem to handle the retry configurations correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the retry configurations and re-enable failed tasks if they are eligible for retry.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.retry > 0 and task.id not in necessary_tasks:
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # re-enable the failed task
        elif task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

This corrected code checks if a task is failed and eligible for retry, then re-enables it by setting its status to 'PENDING'. This should address the issue of assistant workers not retrying failed tasks.
