The bug is likely located in the 'prune' function, specifically in the loop that iterates over the active tasks and attempts to re-enable failed tasks handled by assistant workers. The bug occurs because the 'remove' attribute of the task is not properly set to the correct value. This causes the assistant workers to never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry, leading to the test failure.

To fix this bug, the 'prune' function needs to correctly set the 'remove' attribute of the tasks based on their retry configurations. This will ensure that failed tasks eligible for retry are re-enabled by assistant workers.

Here's the corrected code for the 'prune' function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        retry_delay = task.retry if 'retry' in task else self._config.retry_delay
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.failures < self._config.disable_failures:
                task.remove = retry_delay
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this corrected code, I've added a condition to check if the task status is 'FAILED' and the number of failures is less than the configured maximum failures. If this condition is met, the 'remove' attribute of the task is set to the retry delay specified in the task's retry configuration or the default retry delay from the scheduler configuration. This change ensures that failed tasks eligible for retry are re-enabled by assistant workers.

After integrating this correction, the 'prune' function should function as expected, and the test case 'test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant' should pass successfully.
