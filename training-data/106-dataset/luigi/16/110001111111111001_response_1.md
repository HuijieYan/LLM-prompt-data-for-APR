The provided error message is from a test function `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant`. The test is trying to set a failed task to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but the actual result is still 'FAILED'. This issue is likely related to the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class, which is responsible for handling task and worker statuses. 

The root cause of this bug may be due to incorrect logic in the `prune` function. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the status of the tasks and workers after the specified time interval. As a result, the test case fails, indicating that the status of the task was not updated as expected.

To fix this, the `prune` function should properly check the time intervals to determine when to update the task and worker statuses. Additionally, the logic for updating the status of tasks and workers within the function needs to be carefully reviewed and updated if necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        
    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the condition to check if assistant_ids is not required. I have removed that check and directly assigned values to `assistant_ids` and `necessary_tasks`. Also, the `get_active_tasks` and `get_necessary_tasks` methods are called without any parameters as they are predefined in the function definition.
