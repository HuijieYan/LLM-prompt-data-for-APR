The test case 'test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant' adds a worker 'X' as an assistant and then adds a task 'A' for that worker with a status of 'FAILED'. It then checks if the status of the task 'A' is 'PENDING' after 101 seconds. The error message indicates that the status is not as expected.

Looking at the code for the 'prune' method, the issue might be related to the failure of the task not being correctly handled. The function is supposed to fail dead worker tasks and prune tasks based on their necessity. However, it seems like the task's status is not being updated correctly.

The reason for this bug could be that the failure of the task is not being properly handled in the 'prune' method, leading to an incorrect status being reported in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the failure of the task is properly handled and that the status is updated accordingly. This might involve changes in the logic of how tasks are pruned and how their status is managed.

Here's the corrected code for the 'prune' method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
