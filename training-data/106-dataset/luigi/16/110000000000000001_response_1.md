Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is occurring in the loop that iterates through the active tasks. There seems to be a logical error with the condition `if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config)`, which might be causing incorrect tasks to be removed.

Reason for Bug:
The logical error in the condition might be causing tasks that are necessary to be incorrectly removed, or unnecessary tasks to not be removed.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Revise the logic in the loop for iterating through active tasks to properly handle the removal of tasks based on their necessity and the result of the `prune` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = {t.id for t in self._state.get_necessary_tasks()}
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
