The error message from the test function indicates that the task status is not changing from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after the time is updated. This suggests that the bug may be related to the `prune` function not handling the retry of failed tasks properly.

The potential error location within the `prune` function is the handling of failed tasks and the retry logic for those tasks.

The bug occurs because the `prune` function does not correctly re-enable failed tasks after a certain time period.

To fix the bug, the `prune` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the re-enabling of failed tasks after a certain time period.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        elif task.status == "FAILED" and (datetime.now() - task.updated) > timedelta(seconds=100):  # retry logic for failed tasks
            self._state.reenable_task(task.id)  # re-enable the failed task

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the `prune` function now includes a retry logic for failed tasks. If a task is in a 'FAILED' status and the current time minus the last updated time of the task exceeds 100 seconds, the task is re-enabled by calling the `_state.reenable_task(task.id)` method.

This change should address the bug and allow failed tasks to be re-enabled after a certain time period, as expected by the test function.
