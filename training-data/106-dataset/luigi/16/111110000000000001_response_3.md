The potential error in the `prune` function is that it is trying to call the `prune` method on the `worker` object, but the `worker` object might not have a `prune` method. This is the reason for the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `worker.prune(self._config)` line and replace it with a condition that checks whether the worker needs to be removed based on some criteria.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.is_timed_out(self._config.worker_disconnect_delay):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []
    
    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()
    
    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this corrected code, I replaced the `worker.prune(self._config)` line with `worker.is_timed_out(self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)` which checks if the worker is timed out based on a specific time threshold.

This should fix the bug in the `prune` function.
