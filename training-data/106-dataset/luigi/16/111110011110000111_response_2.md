The error message from the test function indicates that a task that was initially marked as 'FAILED' should transition to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds. However, the assertion fails because the task status remains 'FAILED' instead of changing to 'PENDING'.

The potential error location is within the `prune` function in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The issue seems to be related to how failed tasks are handled for assistant workers.

The current `prune` function does not appear to be handling the retry logic correctly for failed tasks, especially for assistant workers. This is why the task status remains 'FAILED' instead of transitioning to 'PENDING' after the specified time.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to review the logic for handling failed tasks and ensure that assistant workers are able to retry failed tasks as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.is_failed() and task.worker.is_assistant():
            self._state.retry_task(task.id)  # Retrying the failed task for assistant workers
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to retry the failed task specifically for assistant workers if it meets the retry criteria. This should address the issue of assistant workers not retrying failed tasks as expected.
