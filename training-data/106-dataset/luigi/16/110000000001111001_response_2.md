The issue is with the `prune` method which is intended to prune unnecessary tasks and workers from the task graph. The code contains multiple issues like missing imports, undefined variables, and wrong method calls.

The potential error locations are:
1. `worker.prune(self._config)` - It seems that the correct method name should be `worker.timed_out(self._config)` instead of `prune`. This could be the reason for the error.
2. `self._state.prune(task, self._config)` - The correct method name should be `self._state.prune_task(task, self._config)`.

The bug occurred due to incorrect method names and missing imports.

To fix the bug, follow these steps:
1. Import the `logger` module as it is used in the code but not imported.
2. Correct the method calls for `prune` method on `worker` and `task`.
3. Update the method name calls with `timed_out` and `prune_task` respectively.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import logging  # Add missing import for logger

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.timed_out(self._config):  # Corrected method call
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune_task(task, self._config):  # Corrected method call
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
