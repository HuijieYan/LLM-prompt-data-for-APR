The error occurs in the function `prune` of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The issue seems to be that the task status is not being updated correctly, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location is in the part of the code where the task status is updated based on certain conditions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the conditions for updating the task status are not properly handled, causing the status to remain as 'FAILED' when it should have been updated to 'PENDING' after the specified time.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the task status is updated correctly based on the conditions specified in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    # update task status based on time elapsed
    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.status == 'FAILED' and task.time + task.retry_delay < current_time():
            task.status = 'PENDING'

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we added a loop at the end of the function to update the task status based on the elapsed time and retry delay. This should address the issue of the task status not being updated correctly, and the test case should pass as expected.
