The error is occurring in the `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` test function. The test sets a task with the status `FAILED` and then expects the task's status to change to `PENDING` after 100 seconds. However, the assertion fails because the task's status remains `FAILED` instead of changing to `PENDING`.

The potential error location is in the `prune` function. It seems that the `prune` function is not properly handling the re-enablement of failed tasks, especially those associated with assistant workers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `prune` function is not correctly identifying and re-enabling failed tasks, leading to the failed assertion in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `prune` function should be updated to correctly handle re-enabling of failed tasks, especially those associated with assistant workers. It should properly identify failed tasks that are eligible for retry and update their status accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.is_failed():
            logger.info("Worker %s has failed tasks. Trying to re-enable them.", worker)
            worker.re_enable_failed_tasks()

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.is_failed() and task.id not in necessary_tasks:
            task.re_enable()
            logger.info("Re-enabled task %s", task.id)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the `prune` function iterates through active workers and re-enables any failed tasks associated with them. It also identifies necessary tasks and re-enables any failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

This updated `prune` function should address the bug and ensure that failed tasks, especially those associated with assistant workers, are properly re-enabled when eligible for retry.
