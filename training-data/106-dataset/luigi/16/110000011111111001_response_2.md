The bug seems to be occurring in the `prune` function, particularly in the portion where it checks if the task needs to be pruned by invoking `self._state.prune(task, self._config)`.

The error message in the test function indicates that the status of task 'A' is not changing from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, which is unexpected. This suggests an issue with task status update, possibly related to the pruning logic.

The most likely reason behind this bug is that the function is incorrectly identifying tasks that need to be pruned. It may be failing to update the task status from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after the specified time has passed.

To fix this bug, the pruning logic should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly identifies tasks that need to be pruned. Additionally, the mechanism for updating the task status after a certain time period should be verified.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.id in remove_tasks:
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # Update status to PENDING after pruning

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, after identifying and adding the tasks that need to be removed into the `remove_tasks` list, the function explicitly updates the status of the tasks from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' if they are in the `remove_tasks` list. This ensures that the task status is correctly updated after pruning.
