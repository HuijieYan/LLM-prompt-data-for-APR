The potential error in the provided function is in the for loop iterating over the active tasks. It seems that the function is not handling the retry logic correctly for failed tasks.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly checking and retrying the failed tasks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks for failed tasks and retries them based on the retry configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the prune function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.status == 'FAILED' and task.retry > 0:  # Check for failed tasks eligible for retry
            task.retry -= 1  # Decrement retry count
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # Change status to PENDING for retry
        elif self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check for failed tasks eligible for retry based on the retry count. If the task is eligible for retry, we decrement the retry count and change the status to PENDING for retry. This ensures that the function retries the failed tasks based on the retry configuration.
