The issue occurs in the `prune` function of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class, where the code fails to properly handle the retrying of failed tasks by assistant workers.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly considering tasks that are eligible for retry. When a task fails, the assistant workers are not attempting to retry the failed tasks, even if they are eligible for retries according to the configuration.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to properly handle the retrying of failed tasks. This can be achieved by ensuring that the assistant workers check for tasks that are eligible for retry and attempt to retry them accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        # Checking if task is eligible for retry
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            # Retrying the failed task
            if task.failures.retry:
                task.failures.retry -= 1  # Decrement the retry count
                task.status = 'PENDING'  # Mark the task as pending for retry
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
            else:
                task.status = 'FAILED'  # Mark the task as failed
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we check if the task is eligible for a retry based on the configuration (`task.failures.retry`). If it is eligible, we decrement the retry count and mark the task as pending for retry. If it's not eligible, we mark the task as failed. This handles the retrying of failed tasks by assistant workers.
