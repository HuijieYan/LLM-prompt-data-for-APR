The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` is setting the time, adding a worker, and adding a task. Then it asserts that the task status should be `FAILED`, which is expected. After setting the time to 101 seconds and pinging the worker, it asserts that the task status should change to `PENDING`. However, the actual status is still `FAILED`, which causes the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be the logic that handles the task status update.

The bug occurs because the function `prune` is not correctly handling the retry configuration for failed tasks. It should check if the task is eligible for retry based on its retry configuration, but it directly sets the task status to `FAILED` without considering the retry conditions.

To fix the bug, the `prune` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the retry configurations and update the task status accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.retry > 0:  # Check if the task is failed and eligible for retry
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # Update the task status to PENDING for retry
        elif task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the modified code, the task status update logic has been added to handle the retry configurations. If a task is failed and eligible for retry based on its retry configuration, its status is updated to `PENDING`. This change ensures that failed tasks eligible for retry will be retried as expected.
