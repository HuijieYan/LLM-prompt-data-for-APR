Based on the given information, it appears that the bug occurs in the 'prune' function of the 'CentralPlannerScheduler' class. The test case 'test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant' sets up a scenario where a task with ID 'A' is added to the scheduler with a status of 'FAILED'. It then checks if the status changes from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds.

The bug seems to be related to the task status transition. The expected status transition should be from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but the current implementation doesn't handle this transition properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'prune' function doesn't update the task status correctly when transitioning from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING'.

To fix the bug, the 'prune' function needs to be modified to properly update the task status based on the specified conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the 'prune' function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    for task in remove_tasks:
        self._state.get_task_by_id(task).status = 'PENDING'  # Update status to PENDING

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, after removing the tasks, it updates the status of the removed tasks to 'PENDING', allowing the test case 'test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant' to pass successfully.
