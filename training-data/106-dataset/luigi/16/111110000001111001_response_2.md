The potential issue in the provided prune function is that the value for the 'remove' attribute in the task object is different in the expected value and actual value. The expected value for the 'remove' attribute is None, while the actual value is 1000.

It seems like the bug is related to the way the 'remove' attribute of the task is being set. In the provided buggy function, the 'remove' attribute is being set to 1000 based on some condition, which does not align with the expected value of None.

To fix this bug, we should update the condition that sets the 'remove' attribute of the task to ensure that it aligns with the expected value of None.

Here's the corrected code for the prune function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary condition setting the 'remove' attribute of the task has been removed, aligning it with the expected value of None.
