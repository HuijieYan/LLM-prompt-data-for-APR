The error message in the test function indicates that the expected status of the task 'A' is 'PENDING' but it is actually 'FAILED'. This suggests that the problem lies within the 'prune' function that is being called in the test case.

Looking at the 'prune' function, the issue seems to be in the logic for handling the status of tasks. The method is inactivating tasks if they are not in the necessary tasks list, which may be causing tasks to be incorrectly marked as 'FAILED' when they should be 'PENDING'.

To fix the issue, one possible approach is to review the logic for inactivating tasks in the 'prune' function to ensure that tasks are correctly categorized based on their status. It may involve re-evaluating the conditions for inactivating tasks and the role of necessary tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the 'prune' function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining necessary tasks has been revised to ensure that tasks are appropriately categorized. This should address the issue with tasks being incorrectly marked as 'FAILED' instead of 'PENDING'.
