The potential error location within the `prune` method is in the logic that handles retrying failed tasks. It looks like the code is not properly retrying failed tasks for assistant workers.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is not correctly handling retrying failed tasks for assistant workers. The expected behavior is that assistant workers should retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry, but the current code is not doing that.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that assistant workers retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.status == 'FAILED' and (task.worker_running == 'assistant' or task.worker_running in assistant_ids):  # Check if task is failed and being run by an assistant worker
                if self._config.retry_delay > 0 and task.retry > 0:  # Check if task is eligible for retry
                    task.status = 'PENDING'  # Retry the task
                    task.retry -= 1  # Decrement the retry count
            else:
                self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With this correction, the `prune` method should now correctly handle retrying failed tasks for assistant workers, ensuring that the assistant workers retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
