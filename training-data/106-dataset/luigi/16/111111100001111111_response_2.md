The buggy function `prune` in the class `CentralPlannerScheduler` has multiple issues:
1. It is overloading the function name 'prune' with different signatures. This is not allowed in Python.
2. The variable `task` is being used without being defined inside the for loop.

The error message "Assistant workers never retry failed tasks" suggests that tasks eligible for retry are not being retried by assistant workers.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the overloaded `prune` functions and keep only one function with the required signature.
2. Properly define the variable `task` inside the for loop.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this corrected implementation, the function name is not overloaded, and the variable `task` is properly defined inside the for loop. Additionally, it checks for necessary tasks using `active_tasks` before iterating over them.
