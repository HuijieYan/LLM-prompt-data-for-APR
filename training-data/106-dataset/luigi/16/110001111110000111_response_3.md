1. The test case is checking whether a failed task eventually becomes pending after 100 seconds.

2. The potential error location is the `prune` function, where tasks are being pruned and inactivated based on certain conditions.

3. The reason for the bug is that the `prune` function is not correctly handling the re-enabling of failed tasks, which causes the test case to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `prune` function correctly handles the re-enabling of failed tasks and sets their status to pending after a certain duration.

5. Corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.assistant and (self._config.now() - task.status_changed) > self._config.retry_timeout:
            task.set_status('PENDING')

        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we handle the re-enabling of failed tasks by checking if the task is failed, is an assistant task, and has exceeded the retry timeout. Then, we set the task status to 'PENDING'. This ensures that failed tasks eligible for retry are correctly re-enabled, thereby fixing the bug.
