The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` sets a task with status FAILED and then expects it to reset to PENDING after 100 seconds. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the task status is not changing as expected.

The potential error in the `prune` function is that it may not be properly re-enabling the failed task after a certain time period.

The bug occurs because the function is likely not properly re-enabling the failed task after a certain time period, as indicated by the test case failure.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `prune` function properly re-enables the failed task after a certain time period.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    
    remove_workers = []
    assistants = self._state.get_assistants()  # Getting the list of assistants
    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in assistants)  # Creating a set of assistant IDs
    
    active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers()
    for worker in active_workers:
        if worker.id not in assistant_ids:  # If the worker is not an assistant
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    
    active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
    return active_workers, active_tasks, assistants

```

This corrected function makes sure to properly handle active workers' pruning where non-assistant workers will be handled differently. It also addresses the potential issue with re-enabling failed tasks after a certain time period.
