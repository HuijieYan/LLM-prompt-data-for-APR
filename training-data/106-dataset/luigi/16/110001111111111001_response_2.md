The error is related to the test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant`. The test expects the task status to change from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but the test fails because the status remains 'FAILED'.

The issue lies within the `prune` function itself. The `prune` function is not correctly identifying and handling failed tasks that require re-enabling.

The reason for the bug seems to be related to how the `prune` function is handling the status of failed tasks and not re-enabling them when needed. Additionally, the task's `remove` attribute is not being properly set to the remove delay value.

To fix this bug, you should ensure that the `prune` function correctly identifies failed tasks that need to be re-enabled. Additionally, ensure that the `remove` attribute of the tasks is set to the remove delay value.

Below is the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        # Re-enable failed tasks
        if task.status == 'FAILED':
            task.status = 'PENDING'
            task.remove = task.retry  # Set remove attribute to the retry delay value
        else:
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)

        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
