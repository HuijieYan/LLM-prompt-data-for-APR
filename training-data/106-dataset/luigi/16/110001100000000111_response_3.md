The bug is located in the `prune` function. The function is supposed to iterate through active workers, fail dead worker tasks, and prune unnecessary tasks. However, the code is not correctly handling the failure of dead worker tasks and the pruning of unnecessary tasks.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is not correctly identifying and handling necessary and unnecessary tasks. This can lead to the failure of necessary tasks and the retention of unnecessary tasks.

To fix the bug:
1. The code needs to correctly identify necessary tasks by checking if their id is in the set of assistant ids. If assistant ids exist, then necessary tasks should be obtained using `self._state.get_necessary_tasks()`.

2. The dead worker tasks should only be failed if they are not necessary tasks. This can be checked using `task.id not in necessary_tasks`.

3. The pruning of tasks should also take into account if they are necessary or not, and only prune the tasks that are unnecessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers()
    for worker in active_workers:
        if worker.id not in self._state.get_assistants():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    necessary_tasks = set(self._state.get_necessary_tasks())

    remove_tasks = []

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and not task.complete() and not task.failed():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if not task.complete() and not task.failed() and not task.running() and not necessary_tasks.intersection(task.dependencies()):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

This corrected code properly identifies necessary tasks, fails dead worker tasks for unnecessary tasks, and prunes unnecessary tasks.
