1. The test case is checking whether a failed task transitions to a pending state after 100 seconds. However, the assertion fails because the task status remains "FAILED" instead of transitioning to "PENDING" after 100 seconds.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling failed tasks in the `prune` method.

3. The bug occurs because the `prune` method does not correctly retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry. This causes the tasks to remain in the "FAILED" state instead of transitioning to "PENDING" after the specified duration.

4. To fix the bug, the `prune` method needs to properly handle the retry logic for failed tasks. This may involve checking the retry configurations for the tasks and re-enabling them if they are eligible for retry.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks:
            retry_config = task.get_retry_config()
            if task.failed and retry_config:
                last_failure_time = task.get_last_failure_time()
                if last_failure_time and datetime.now() - last_failure_time > timedelta(seconds=retry_config["retry_delay"]):
                    task.set_pending()  # Transition the task to PENDING state after the retry delay
        else:
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With the corrected code, the `prune` method now properly handles the retry logic for failed tasks, transitioning them to the "PENDING" state after the specified retry delay. This should address the bug where failed tasks were not being retried.
