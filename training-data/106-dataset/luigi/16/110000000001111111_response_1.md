The code provided is a method called "prune" within the CentralPlannerScheduler class. The function is intended to prune the task graph by removing workers and tasks that are no longer active or necessary.

The issue seems to be related to the failure to retry tasks that are eligible for retry. This can be seen from the expected variable values in the test case compared to the actual values. It appears that the "remove" attribute of the task is not being set properly, causing the task to not be retried.

The potential error location within the function is when the tasks are being checked for pruning:

```python
if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
    remove_tasks.append(task.id)
```

It seems that the "remove" attribute of the task is not being properly set based on the retry configuration, leading to the task not being retried when it should be.

To fix the bug, the "remove" attribute of the task needs to be set based on the retry configuration. This can be done by checking the retry configuration and updating the "remove" attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the "prune" function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)

        if task.id in necessary_tasks:
            task.remove = None  # Reset the remove attribute
        elif self._config.retry_delay and task.failures < self._config.disable_failures:
            task.remove = self._config.remove_delay  # Set the remove attribute based on the retry configuration
        else:
            task.remove = None  # Reset the remove attribute

        if self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
