The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` sets a task with status "FAILED" and then expects it to change to "PENDING" after 100 seconds. However, the error message indicates that the status remains "FAILED" instead of changing to "PENDING" after 101 seconds. This suggests that the function responsible for changing the status of the task is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the `prune` function is likely related to the logic for handling failed tasks with assistants. The function is supposed to re-enable failed tasks with assistants after a certain time, but it seems that this logic is not working correctly.

The bug occurs because the code that is supposed to re-enable failed tasks with assistants after a certain time is not properly implemented. As a result, the tasks remain in the "FAILED" state and are not retried as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for re-enabling failed tasks with assistants after a certain time needs to be corrected. This involves making sure that the tasks' status changes to "PENDING" after the specified time, indicating that they are ready to be retried.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")

    # Re-enable failed tasks with assistants after a certain time
    for task_id in self._state.get_tasks_with_assistants():
        if self._state.task_time_elapsed(task_id) >= self._config.retry_time:
            self._state.retry_task(task_id)

    logger.info("Done re-enabling failed tasks with assistants")
```

In the corrected code, I added a new portion at the end of the `prune` function to re-enable failed tasks with assistants after a certain time. This is achieved by checking if the time elapsed for the task exceeds the retry time specified in the configuration, and then retrying the task if it meets this condition.
