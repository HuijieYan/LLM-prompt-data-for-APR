The buggy function "prune" is supposed to remove any inactive workers and tasks from the state. It also handles failing tasks, and if they are not necessary, it prunes them from the state.

The bug seems to be in the logic that handles failing tasks. It looks like the "remove" attribute for tasks is not being set correctly when determining if a task should be pruned. This might be causing the tasks to not be retried by assistant workers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "remove" attribute for tasks is properly set and that assistant workers can retry failed tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the "prune" function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        elif task.status == 'FAILED' and not task.runnable:
            task.remove = self._config.remove_delay  # Set the remove attribute for failed tasks

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, when a task is failed and not runnable, we explicitly set the "remove" attribute to the value specified in the configuration, allowing assistant workers to retry failed tasks.
