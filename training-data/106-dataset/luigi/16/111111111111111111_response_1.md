The bug is located in the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The issue is that the task status is not being updated correctly after it should have been retried.

The reason for the bug is that when an assistant worker marks a task as failed and later the conditions are met for the task to be retried, the task status is not being updated from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING'.

To fix the bug, the `fail_dead_worker_task` method needs to update the task status to 'PENDING' when the retry conditions are met.

Here's the corrected code for the `fail_dead_worker_task` method and the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class:

```python
# corrected fail_dead_worker_task method
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    # ... omitted code ...
  
    def fail_dead_worker_task(self, task, config, assistants):
        # ... omitted code ...
        task_failures = task.failures.count_failures(worker_id=worker.id)
        if task_failures < self._config.disable_failures:
            retry_delay = min(self._config.retry_delay * 2 ** task_failures, self._config.disable_hard_timeout)
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # Update the task status to 'PENDING' when retry conditions are met
        else:
            task.status = 'FAILED'
        # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected prune method
    def prune(self):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)

        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []

        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()

        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With these changes, the `fail_dead_worker_task` method will now update the task status to 'PENDING' when the retry conditions are met, and the `prune` method should work correctly to retry the failed tasks. This should fix the bug where assistant workers never retry failed tasks.
