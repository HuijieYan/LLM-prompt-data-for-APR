The bug in the given function is that the two methods `prune` and `inactivate_workers` are being called from the `self._state` object, but `self._state` has no such methods defined in its class. Additionally, the method `fail_dead_worker_task` is being called incorrectly by passing `assistant_ids` as the third argument when the correct argument is `assistants`. 

To fix this issue, the correct methods on `self._state` should be called, and the `fail_dead_worker_task` method should be updated to the correct signature.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.prune(self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
