The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 166, where `path = self.s3_load_path()` is called.

The reason for the `TypeError` is that `self.s3_load_path` is actually a string, not a method or function. When `self.s3_load_path()` is called as a method, it results in a `TypeError` indicating that a string object is not callable.

To fix this issue, the code should be updated to directly use `self.s3_load_path` as a string, rather than attempting to call it as a method.

Below is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Use the attribute directly as a string
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

With this fix, the code now directly uses `self.s3_load_path` as a string without attempting to call it as a method.

This should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered in the `run` method.
