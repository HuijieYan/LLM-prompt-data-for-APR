Potential error location: 
The line `if not (self.table):` is checking if the `table` attribute is truthy, but it should be checking if it's falsy, as it's raising an exception if the `table` is not specified.

Reason for the bug:
The condition is checking the opposite of what it should be checking, causing the exception to be raised when the `table` is actually specified.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Change the condition to check if the `table` attribute is not specified and raise an exception in that case.

Corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
