The error message indicates a "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" at line 166 in the file luigi/contrib/redshift.py. This means that the variable `self.s3_load_path` is being called as a function, but it is of type `str`.

The potential error location within the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class is where `self.s3_load_path` is being called. Based on the provided information, `self.s3_load_path` is not a method or callable object, but a string.

The reason behind this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is likely intended to be a property or an attribute, but in the current implementation, it is mistakenly treated as a method and called with parentheses.

To fix the bug, `self.s3_load_path` should be accessed as a property or an attribute without parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Accessing as a property or attribute
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
