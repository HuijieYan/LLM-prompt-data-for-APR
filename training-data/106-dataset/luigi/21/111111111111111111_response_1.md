The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following section:

```python
if main_task_cls:
    cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
```

The reason behind the bug occurrence is that the `cmdline_args` is initialized as `None` by default and the code does not handle the case where `main_task_cls` is not provided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `cmdline_args` is `None` and then create it if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if cmdline_args is None:
        cmdline_args = []
    
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

With this modification, the code now initializes `cmdline_args` as an empty list if it is not provided and then proceeds with the remaining logic. This should fix the AttributeError that was occurring in the previous version of the code.
