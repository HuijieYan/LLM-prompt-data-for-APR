The potential error in the function is the use of the `insert()` method on the `cmdline_args` list. This method is used to insert an element at a specific index in the list. The issue is that it shifts the existing elements to the right, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

In both test cases, the `insert()` method is used to insert elements at index 0 of the `cmdline_args` list. This can cause unexpected results, as it shifts the existing elements to the right, and this might not be the intended behavior.

To fix the function, we can create a new list with the required elements at the beginning, followed by the existing `cmdline_args` elements. This will prevent any unexpected shifting of elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()

    actual_cmdline_args = []
    if main_task_cls:
        actual_cmdline_args.append(main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        actual_cmdline_args.append('--local-scheduler')
    actual_cmdline_args.extend(cmdline_args)

    tasks = interface.parse(actual_cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

In the corrected function, we create a new list `actual_cmdline_args` and then append the required elements at the beginning followed by the existing `cmdline_args` elements using the `extend()` method. This ensures that the original `cmdline_args` list is not modified and the elements are added in the correct order.
