Based on the error message from the test function, the `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` test is failing because the status of task 'A' is expected to be `DISABLED` but it is actually `FAILED`.

The potential error in the `set_status` method could be related to the conditions for changing the status of the task. The `if` conditions and their respective code blocks should be thoroughly examined as they determine the assignment of a new status to the task.

It seems like when the time reaches 101 seconds, the task 'A' should still be disabled based on the test case. However, the current implementation may change its status to `FAILED` for some reason, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the conditions within the `set_status` method need to be carefully reviewed. Specifically, the condition handling the change from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` might be causing the issue. Additionally, the logic associated with changing the status based on time constraints should be checked.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:
        if task.status in self._status_tasks and task.id in self._status_tasks[task.status]:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for status change based on time constraints and excessive failures has been adjusted to ensure that the task's status is set correctly. Additionally, the final block of code ensures that the task's status is updated in the `_status_tasks` dictionary only if it actually changes.
