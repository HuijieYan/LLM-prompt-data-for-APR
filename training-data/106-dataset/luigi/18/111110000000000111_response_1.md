The potential error in the provided code lies in the conditional statement `if new_status == FAILED:` where it is checking for the `FAILED` status without defining it. This may result in a NameError as the variable `FAILED` is not defined anywhere in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `FAILED` status and provide a value for it.

Potential approaches to fix the bug:
1. Define the `FAILED` status as a constant variable at the beginning of the class.
2. Provide a default value for the `FAILED` status.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.

    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # Define the status constants
    FAILED = "failed"
    DISABLED = "disabled"
    RUNNING = "running"
    DONE = "done"

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        # Define the FAILED status
        if new_status == self.FAILED:
            assert config is not None

                self.re_enable(task)
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == self.FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != self.DISABLED:
