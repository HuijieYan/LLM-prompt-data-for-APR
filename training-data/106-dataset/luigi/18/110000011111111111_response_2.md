The error message indicates that the actual status of the task after 101 seconds is "FAILED" instead of "DISABLED" as expected. This suggests that the `set_status` function is not correctly handling the transition from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" after 100 seconds.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is in the conditional block that checks for maintaining the disabled status after it's been set manually.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug may be related to the conditions for setting the disabled status not being properly handled, especially in cases where the manual setting of "DISABLED" is involved.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that setting the status to "DISABLED" manually will not be overridden after a certain period. Another approach is to verify the conditions for setting the status to "DISABLED" and to ensure that these conditions are properly handled within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        # Ensure that the manual setting of "DISABLED" is not overridden
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

By explicitly checking for the manual setting of "DISABLED" and ensuring that it won't be overridden, the corrected function aims to address the issue observed in the test case.
