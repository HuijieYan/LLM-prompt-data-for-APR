The error message indicates an assertion error in the test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable`. The test expects the status of task A to be 'DISABLED' after 100 seconds, but it is actually 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the status change when a task has excessive failures. In this section, if a task has excessive failures, it is immediately set to 'DISABLED' status without considering the current status. This bypasses the logic that keeps the task 'DISABLED' after it has been manually set to that status.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the transition to 'DISABLED' status when a task already has that status.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles the status transition when a task has excessive failures. Instead of immediately setting the task to 'DISABLED', we should check if it is not already in that status due to a manual change.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    # Check if the task is not already in DISABLED status due to manual change
    if task.status != DISABLED:
        if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
            # Re-enable the task when new status is DONE
            self.re_enable(task)
            return
        # If task has excessive failures, set it to DISABLED status
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
    
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks the current status of the task before transitioning to the 'DISABLED' status. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
