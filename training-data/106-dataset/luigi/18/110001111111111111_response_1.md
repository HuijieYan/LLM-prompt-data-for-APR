The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is testing the behavior of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` with regards to re-enabling tasks after they have been automatically disabled due to excessive failures.

The error message indicates that the task status is not as expected. The test is expecting the task status to be 'DISABLED' but it is actually 'FAILED'.

It seems that the issue lies within the `set_status` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler`. When the test case sets the task status to 'FAILED' and then 'DISABLED', the scheduler is not handling the transition correctly.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of task status transitions within the `set_status` method. When the task status is changed to 'DISABLED' after being 'FAILED', the scheduler should handle this transition properly.

To fix the issue, the `set_status` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the transition of task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' and vice versa. Additionally, the conditions for task status transitions should be carefully reviewed and verified.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:  # Skip disabling tasks that are currently running
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task)

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            # Notification logic here
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update task status and status tasks mappings
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This corrected `set_status` method should now properly handle the transitions between 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' and maintain the correct task status as expected.
