The error message is indicating that the status of task 'A' is not as expected. The test case is expecting the status to be 'DISABLED' but it is actually 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block that handles the situation when new_status is set to DISABLED and the task status is DISABLED. The code is not correctly handling the transition from FAILED to DISABLED and DISABLED to FAILED.

The bug occurs because when the task status is set to FAILED and then to DISABLED, the function does not handle the transition properly and ends up with the incorrect status.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for setting the status of the task and handle the transitions between different statuses properly.

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    # Check and handle transitions between different statuses
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task)
    elif new_status == DISABLED and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update status of the task
    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
