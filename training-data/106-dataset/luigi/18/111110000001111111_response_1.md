The bug here is in the 'set_status' function of the class 'SimpleTaskState'. The function is not handling certain status transitions correctly.

In the first case, when the new_status is 'FAILED', and the current status is not 'DISABLED', the function should set the new status to 'DISABLED' if there are excessive failures and send an error email. However, the function incorrectly sets the new status to 'DISABLED' without considering the existing status of the task.

In the second case, when the new_status is 'DISABLED', the function is not resetting the 'scheduler_disable_time' to None, which should happen according to the expected output.

In the third case, when the new_status is 'DISABLED', the function should reset the 'scheduler_disable_time' to None, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, the 'set_status' function needs to be updated to handle status transitions properly. The function should also be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from time import time
import notifications

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        
        if new_status == 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = 0  # Reset the scheduler_disable_time
        else:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected function, the status transitions are handled correctly, and the code is updated to follow best practices and improve readability.
