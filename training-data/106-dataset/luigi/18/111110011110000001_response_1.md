Based on the error message, the test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is failing because the status of task 'A' is expected to be DISABLED but is actually FAILED. This indicates that the `set_status` function is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function could be the logic for handling the transition from DISABLED to DONE and for re-enabling the task. It seems like the logic for transitioning the task status and re-enabling the task after it has been disabled is incorrect.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is likely due to incorrect conditional checks and state transitions within the `set_status` function.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks and state transitions within the `set_status` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the transition from DISABLED to DONE and for re-enabling the task after it has been disabled needs to be reviewed.

The corrected code for the `set_status` function is as follows:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                    f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
                    )
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        if task.status in self._status_tasks:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
``` 

In this corrected code, the logic for handling transitions from DISABLED to DONE and for re-enabling the task after it has been disabled has been updated. Additionally, string formatting has been updated to use f-strings for better readability.
