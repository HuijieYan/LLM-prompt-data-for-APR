Analysis:
The function `set_status` contains conditional logic and task status checks. It also uses a `config` object for some validations. The bug occurs when the task status transitions from 'PENDING' to 'FAILED'.

The bug likely occurs in the block where new_status is 'FAILED' and 'task.status' is not 'DISABLED', resulting in the task status being updated to 'FAILED' and the task being added to the status tasks list.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED` does not consider the case where `task.status` is initially 'PENDING' and the new_status changes to 'FAILED'.

Possible Approaches:
1. Update the condition to handle the case where task status is 'PENDING' and new_status is 'FAILED'.
2. Add another condition to handle the case where new_status is 'FAILED' and task status is 'PENDING'.

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status == PENDING:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
