The buggy function `set_status` is intended to update the status of a task and make related adjustments to the scheduler's internal state. However, there are some issues in the code. 

The bug seems to be occurring when the status of a task is updated. In particular, there are issues with setting a task to `DISABLED` status. The logic that handles failing tasks doesn't properly handle the transition to `DISABLED` status when tasks have excessive failures.

The corrected code should properly handle the transition to `DISABLED` status when tasks have excessive failures, and ensure that the scheduler state is updated accordingly.

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
In this corrected code, the logic for transitioning to `DISABLED` status has been fixed to properly handle excessive failures and send the appropriate notifications. Additionally, the code now updates the scheduler state and the task's status correctly.
