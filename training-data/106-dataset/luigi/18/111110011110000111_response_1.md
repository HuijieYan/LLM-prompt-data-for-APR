The error message indicates that the test is failing when checking the status of task 'A'. It expected the status to be 'DISABLED', but it was 'FAILED' instead.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it deals with setting the new status for a task based on certain conditions.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the status transition of the task correctly. It is not properly updating the task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' and vice versa based on the conditions provided.

To fix the bug, the conditions for status transition should be reviewed and updated. The function should correctly set the new status of the task based on the provided conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status != FAILED:  # new condition to prevent overriding scheduler disable
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status != task.status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
