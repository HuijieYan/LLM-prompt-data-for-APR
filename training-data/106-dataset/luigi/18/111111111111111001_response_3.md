The test case "test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable" checks whether a task remains disabled even after 100 seconds have passed. The test first adds the task with a "FAILED" status twice, which should result in the task being disabled. Then it explicitly sets the task as disabled and checks whether it remains disabled after 100 seconds.

The error message indicates that the status of the task after 100 seconds is "FAILED" instead of "DISABLED," which is expected according to the test.

The problem lies in the "set_status" function where the status is not correctly updated in some cases.

The reason for the bug is that the logic for updating the status of the task based on the new status and other conditions is not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect status updates.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for updating the task's status based on the new status and the task's current status, as well as any other relevant conditions.

Below is the corrected "set_status" function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task, config)
    elif task.status != DISABLED and new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
