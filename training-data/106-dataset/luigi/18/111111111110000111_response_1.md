1. The error message indicates that the test `'no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable'` failed because the expected status of the task `'A'` was `'DISABLED'`, but the actual status was `'FAILED'`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the re-enable logic when the status of the task changes to `'DONE'`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the task status changes to `'DONE'`, the code should call the `re_enable` method. However, the existing logic in the `set_status` method only checks if the new status is `'DONE' and the task status is `'DISABLED'`. It should also check if the task status is `'DISABLED_AUTOMATIC'`, meaning that it was automatically disabled due to excessive failures.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the logic in the `set_status` method to call the `re_enable` method not only when the new status is `'DONE' and the task status is `'DISABLED'`, but also when the task status is `'DISABLED_AUTOMATIC'`.
   - Update the logic to handle the task status transitions correctly based on if the task was automatically disabled or manually disabled.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected set_status method
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        # Additionally check for the new status being DONE and the task being automatically disabled
        elif new_status == DONE and task.status == DISABLED_AUTOMATIC:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
With the corrected `set_status` method, the logic now appropriately handles the re-enablement of tasks when the status transitions to `'DONE' and the task was either manually or automatically disabled.
