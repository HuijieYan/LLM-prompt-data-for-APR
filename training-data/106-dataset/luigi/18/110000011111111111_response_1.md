Upon analyzing the test case and the error message, it seems that the function `set_status` is not working as intended. The error occurs when the test function expects the status of task A to be DISABLED after 100 seconds, but the status remains FAILED.

Upon reviewing the function `set_status`, it appears that the logic for handling FAILED and DISABLED statuses might have issues. The potential error location is in the conditional statements and status assignments within the `set_status` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be that the conditions for transitioning between FAILED and DISABLED statuses are not properly handled, leading to incorrect status assignments.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling the transition between the FAILED and DISABLED statuses need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted. Additionally, the task status assignment logic needs to be thoroughly evaluated to ensure correct transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.status == "DISABLED":
        return  # Return if the task is already disabled

    if new_status == "DISABLED" and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return  # Prevent transitioning to DISABLED while the task is running

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        # Re-enable the task when transitioning from DISABLED to DONE
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)

    # Transition to DISABLED if the task has excessive failures
    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable() and task.status != "DISABLED":
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        # Clear scheduler_disable_time when transitioning to DISABLED
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update the status in the task list
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

The corrected function includes improved conditional handling for transitioning between FAILED and DISABLED statuses, along with more accurate status assignments based on the conditions.
