Potential error location:
The code that handles the status transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' is likely the source of the bug. This can be identified by the fact that the code snippet is intended to handle transitioning between different task statuses, and this is where the issue arises.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the logic for transitioning the task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' is not being properly handled. This is evident from the input and output variable values in the buggy cases, where the expected status transition and associated state changes are not met.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The logic for transitioning from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' should be revisited to ensure that the necessary state changes are applied correctly.
2. Conditional checks related to the transition should be evaluated thoroughly to identify any missing conditions or incorrect logic.
3. The handling of task status transitions in general should be reviewed to ensure consistent and accurate transition management.
4. Add thorough unit tests that cover the specific logic for transitioning the task status.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == FAILED:  # Add condition to handle transition to DISABLED
            if task.can_disable() and not task.has_excessive_failures():  
                return  # Ignore transition if task can't be disabled or does not have excessive failures
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
The corrected code includes a more refined logic for transitioning from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' status, addressing the issues identified in the buggy cases.
