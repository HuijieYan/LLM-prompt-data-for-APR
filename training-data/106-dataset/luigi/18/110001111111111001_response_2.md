The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is checking if a task remains disabled once it has been manually set to that status, and that it does not re-enable after 100 seconds. The error message indicates that the task status is not as expected after 101 seconds.

The potential error location is within the `set_status` function, particularly in the handling of the case when `new_status` and `task.status` are both `FAILED`.

The bug occurs because in the `set_status` function, when a task has excessive failures and is being disabled, the status is not updated correctly. This leads to incorrect status handling and failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the status of the task correctly when it has excessive failures and thus needs to be disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Re-enable the task

        # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED  # Update the new_status to DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update the status of the task
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the `set_status` function should now handle the case where a task has excessive failures and is being disabled correctly, leading to the expected behavior in the test case.
