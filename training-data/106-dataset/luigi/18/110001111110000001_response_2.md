The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is asserting that the status of task 'A' should be DISABLED after 101 seconds. However, the current implementation of the `set_status` function is not correctly handling the status change, resulting in the status being set to FAILED instead of DISABLED, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is where the status of the task is being updated based on certain conditions.

The bug occurs because there is an error in the conditional statements within the `set_status` function that is meant to handle the status changes of the task. The condition for setting the status to DISABLED if there are excessive failures is handled incorrectly, leading to the incorrect status being set.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `set_status` function need to be revised to handle the status changes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == Status.FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == Status.DISABLED and task.status == Status.RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == Status.DISABLED:
        if new_status == Status.DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == Status.FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != Status.DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = Status.DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == Status.DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the status comparison for FAILED, DISABLED, and RUNNING is based on an enum value `Status.FAILED`, `Status.DISABLED`, and `Status.RUNNING` instead of direct string comparison. Additionally, the conditional statements are updated to handle the status changes accurately. This should resolve the bug encountered in the test case.
