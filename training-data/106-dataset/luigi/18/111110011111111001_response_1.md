The error occurs when the status of a task is being checked after a certain period of time. The status should remain as "DISABLED" after 100 seconds, but it erroneously changes to "FAILED".

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where the status is being set to "DISABLED" if a task has excessive failures. This happens in the condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED`.

The bug occurs because the status of the task is being incorrectly updated to "FAILED" when it should remain "DISABLED". This incorrect update is triggered when the task has excessive failures, which leads to it being disabled.

To fix this bug, the condition for setting the new_status to "FAILED" needs to be revised to ensure that the task status remains as "DISABLED" as expected after the time delay. One possible approach is to add a separate condition to check for excessive failures and set the status to "FAILED". 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    else:
        if new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With this change, the function will correctly handle setting the status of a task based on the conditions and prevent the incorrect status update leading to the failed test case.
