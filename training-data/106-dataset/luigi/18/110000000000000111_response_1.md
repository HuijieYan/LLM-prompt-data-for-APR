Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is the way it checks and handles different task statuses and their transitions.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug could occur due to incorrect handling of task statuses and their transitions. Additionally, there are conditional checks that don't seem to be correctly structured and may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the conditional checks to ensure that task statuses and their transitions are properly handled.
2. Add necessary validation checks to ensure that the function behaves as intended for all possible scenarios.
3. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._status_tasks = {
            'DISABLED': {},
            'RUNNING': {},
            'DONE': {}
        }

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == 'FAILED':
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
            return

        if task.status == 'DISABLED':
            if new_status == 'DONE':
                self.re_enable(task)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                self.send_error_email(task, new_status, config)
        elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status

    def re_enable(self, task):
        # implement re-enable logic here
        pass

    def send_error_email(self, task, new_status, config):
        # implement email sending logic here
        pass
