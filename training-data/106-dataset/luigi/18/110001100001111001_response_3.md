The potential error in the provided function is related to the incorrect handling of the task status and the logic for transitioning the task between different statuses. 

In the first buggy case, the new status is set to 'FAILED' and checks are performed to see if the task should transition to 'DISABLED' based on certain conditions. However, in the two cases mentioned, the expected output does not align with the actual output, indicating a bug in the conditional logic and status transitions.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for status transitions needs to be revised along with validating the current status of the task against the new status being set.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for handling 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' status transitions has been modified to ensure that the transitions occur as expected.
- The status is only updated if the new status is different from the current status. This prevents unnecessary updates to the status and associated data structures.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle the status transitions based on the specified conditions.
