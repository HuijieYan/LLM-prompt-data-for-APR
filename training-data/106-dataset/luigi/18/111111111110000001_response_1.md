The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is checking whether a task remains disabled after being set as such and after a certain amount of time has passed.

The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' is being reported as 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED' after 101 seconds have passed.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the logic that handles the status change from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' when there are excessive failures. It seems that the logic for disabling the task based on excessive failures is not correctly updating the task status to 'DISABLED', which leads to the test failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the status of the task is not being updated to 'DISABLED' after reaching the threshold for excessive failures. The logic for setting the task status to 'DISABLED' seems to be incomplete or incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic for setting the task status to 'DISABLED' based on excessive failures and ensuring that the status is correctly updated.
2. Ensuring that the correct conditions are in place for updating task status to 'DISABLED' and that all necessary variables are being handled accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:  # Remove this line if not needed
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status != DISABLED:  # If the status is being changed from DISABLED
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)           # Remove the task from _status_tasks['DISABLED']
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task              # Add the task to the new status
    task.status = new_status
```
