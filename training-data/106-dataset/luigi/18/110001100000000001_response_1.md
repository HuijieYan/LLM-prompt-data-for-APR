Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is the use of the variable `FAILED` without it being defined within the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the variable `FAILED` is being used without being defined in the function. This will lead to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The variable `FAILED` should be defined within the function or imported from a relevant module if it's a constant.

Corrected code:
