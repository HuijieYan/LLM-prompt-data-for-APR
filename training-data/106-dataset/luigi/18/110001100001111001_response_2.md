The issue with the `set_status` function is that it has conditional checks for `new_status` and `task.status` but doesn't handle the case when `new_status` is `FAILED` and `task.status` is already `FAILED`. Additionally, there are checks for `DISABLED` status that are redundant and not contributing to the correct operation of the function.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check for `task.status` and update the `task.status` accordingly if it is already `FAILED`. We also need to simplify the conditions for `DISABLED` status.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if task.status == FAILED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        return  # No need for further processing if the task is already in FAILED state

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This code includes the condition to handle the case when `task.status` is already `FAILED` and simplifies the conditions for `DISABLED` status. The redundant conditional checks have been removed and the code should now work as expected.
