The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is testing if a task remains disabled even after the time has passed. The failure occurs when the status of the task is checked after a certain amount of time has passed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code responsible for handling the `DISABLED` status.

The bug occurs because when the task's status is set to `DISABLED`, it is expected to remain in that state even after the time has passed. However, the buggy function does not properly handle the re-enable functionality after a certain amount of time has passed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the task remains in the `DISABLED` state even after the specified time has passed, and it should not re-enable automatically.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED:
        return  # Do nothing if the new status is already DISABLED

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        return  # Do nothing if the task is already DISABLED

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

By making these updates, the task should remain in the `DISABLED` state, and it should not re-enable automatically after a certain amount of time has passed.
