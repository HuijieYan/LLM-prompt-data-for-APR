The bug is likely in the section of the function that handles the task status transitions. Upon reviewing the function, here are the issues identified:

1. The condition that checks `if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING` is incomplete and does not handle all possible cases. It should also check for `task.status == PENDING`.
2. The condition that re-enables a task when its status changes from DISABLED to DONE is not being checked properly. The `re_enable` function should be called with the appropriate arguments, but it is currently called without the `config` argument.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Update the condition `if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING` to include `task.status == PENDING` as well. This ensures that tasks can be marked as DISABLED if they are not only in the RUNNING state, but also if they are PENDING.
2. Modify the `re_enable` function call when new_status is DONE to include the `config` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and (task.status == RUNNING or task.status == PENDING):
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Updated to include the config argument
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
