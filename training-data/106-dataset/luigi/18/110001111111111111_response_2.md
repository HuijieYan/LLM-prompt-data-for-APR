Based on the error message, the assertion failure occurs at line 705 of the test `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable`. The expected value is 'DISABLED' but the actual value is 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the code that's handling the `DISABLED` status. After setting the task status to `DISABLED`, subsequent attempts to re-enable the task are not being handled correctly, leading to the assertion failure in the test case.

The bug occurs because the logic for re-enabling a task after being set to `DISABLED` is missing or incorrect in the `set_status` function.

To fix the bug, we need to add proper handling to re-enable the task after being set to `DISABLED`. This involves checking the elapsed time since the task was disabled and if it's appropriate to re-enable it.

Based on the given code and expected behaviors, here's the corrected `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
            # Re-enable the task if the disable time has passed
            self.re_enable(task)
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
            # Also remove the task from the DISABLED status
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            # Send error email and update status accordingly
        notifications.send_error_email(
            'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
            '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
            'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                failures=config.disable_failures,
                task=task.id,
                window=config.disable_window,
                persist=config.disable_persist,
            ))

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

By adding the correct logic for re-enabling the task in the proper place, we should be able to fix the bug. The corrected logic now checks the elapsed time to determine if re-enabling is necessary and updates the task status accordingly.

This updated implementation should resolve the assertion failure in the test case.
