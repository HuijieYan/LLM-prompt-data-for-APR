The bug in the provided code is likely due to the incorrect conditions being checked for the variable `new_status` and the handling of transitions between different statuses.

The correction is based on the code logic and the expected behavior outlined in the test cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `new_status` comparison with 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' uses strings instead of variables, as it appears from the tests that these are string values.
2. The conditional checks have been updated based on the expected behavior defined in the test cases.
3. The transitions between statuses are properly handled to ensure the correct behavior.

This corrected code should address the issues identified in the original function.
