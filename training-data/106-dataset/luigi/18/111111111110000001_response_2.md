The error message indicates that the test case is expecting the task status to be 'DISABLED' but is getting 'FAILED' instead. This means that the `set_status` function is not correctly changing the status of the task from 'DISABLED' to 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is likely in the section where it checks for excessive failures and disables the task if necessary. There might be an issue with how the status is being updated after a task is disabled due to excessive failures.

The bug occurs because in the `set_status` function, when a task has excessive failures and is disabled, the code does not properly update the status of the task to 'DISABLED'. As a result, the task status remains 'FAILED', causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the status of the task needs to be correctly updated to 'DISABLED' when it has excessive failures and is disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            new_status = DONE  # Update task status to DONE when re-enabled

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status  # Update task status to new_status
```

In the corrected code, after re-enabling the task when it has excessive failures and is disabled, the status of the task is correctly updated to 'DONE'. This update ensures that the test case expecting the task status to be 'DISABLED' will pass as intended.
