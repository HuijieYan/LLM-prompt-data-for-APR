The test case is testing whether a task is automatically re-enabled after being disabled. The error message indicates that the task's status is not as expected. The status should be 'DISABLED' but it's showing 'FAILED' instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the conditions for setting the new status of a task. It seems that the logic for setting the task status is not properly handling the case where a task is manually disabled and not re-enabled after a certain period of time.

The bug occurs because the logic for checking when to re-enable a task after it has been manually disabled is not properly implemented. This leads to incorrect status changes and fails the test case.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to rework the logic for setting the status of a task to properly handle the case of a task being manually disabled and not automatically re-enabled after a certain period of time. This may involve adding new conditional checks and re-evaluating the flow of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# fixed function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                if time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
                    self.re_enable(task)
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
In the corrected code, additional checks have been added for handling the re-enablement of a task after it has been manually disabled. The logic has been reworked to ensure that the task's status is correctly handled in all scenarios.
