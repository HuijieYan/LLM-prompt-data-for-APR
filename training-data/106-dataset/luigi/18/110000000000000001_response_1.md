Potential error location: The if statements to check for new_status and task.status are not properly handling the conditions.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The conditions inside the if statements are not handling all possible scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The code is not handling the conditions where the task status needs to be updated and the corresponding status tasks need to be updated.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Update the if statements to cover all possible scenarios for new_status and task.status.
2. Ensure that the task status and corresponding status tasks are updated as needed.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == "FAILED":
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == "DISABLED" and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable() and task.status != "DISABLED":
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
