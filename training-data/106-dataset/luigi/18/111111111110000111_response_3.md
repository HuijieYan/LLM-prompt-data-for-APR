1. The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` sets up the scheduler with a task status as `FAILED`, then adds the same task with status `DISABLED`. Finally, it simulates the passage of time and expects the task to remain in the `DISABLED` state. However, the actual result is that the task's status changes to `FAILED` instead of remaining `DISABLED`.

2. The potential error location is in the `set_status` function, particularly in the `elif` block where it checks for a new status of `DISABLED` and the current task status as `DISABLED`.

3. The reason for the bug could be that when setting the task status to `DISABLED` and the current status is also `DISABLED`, it does not consider that the task should not be re-enabled. Therefore, the task's status is erroneously updated.

4. The possible fix for the bug is to add a condition to explicitly handle the case when the new status is `DISABLED` and the current status is also `DISABLED` to prevent the task from being re-enabled.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            return  # Added line to avoid further execution in this block.

        # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED and task.status == DISABLED:  # Adjusted condition for handling DISABLED state
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
