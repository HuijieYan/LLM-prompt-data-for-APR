The error message indicates that the 'assertEqual' statement is failing because the status of task 'A' is 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'. This implies that the task is not being disabled as expected.

The potential error location within the function is in the logic for handling task statuses, particularly when setting a new status for a task.

The bug occurs because the logic for setting the status of a task is not correctly handling the DISABLED status. When a new status is set to DISABLED and the task's current status is RUNNING, it should skip setting the new status. However, the function is not checking the current status correctly and still setting the new status to DISABLED.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for setting the status so that when the new status is DISABLED and the task's current status is RUNNING, it skips setting the new status. Additionally, when re-enabling a task, it should be checked if the task was previously disabled by the scheduler, and if so, the disable time should be reset.

Here's the corrected code for the set_status function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # reset the scheduler disable time

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status == RUNNING and new_status == DISABLED:
        return  # skip setting the new status if the task is currently running
        
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
