The error message indicates that the test case is expecting the task with ID 'A' to be in status DISABLED, but it is actually in status FAILED. This suggests that the set_status() function in the SimpleTaskState class is not correctly handling the transition to DISABLED status.

The potential error location within the set_status() function is in the block that handles the transition to DISABLED status after excessive failures.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the set_status() function is not properly handling the transition from FAILED to DISABLED status when there are excessive failures.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the transition to DISABLED status after excessive failures is being properly handled. This involves correctly updating the task status, setting the scheduler_disable_time, and sending the appropriate notifications.

Here's the corrected code for the set_status() function:

```python
# corrected set_status() function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        # set scheduler_disable_time only if it is a new transition
        if task.status != DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
- We set the scheduler_disable_time only if it is a new transition to DISABLED status.
- We update the task status, set the scheduler_disable_time, and send the notifications as expected.
