Potential Error Location: The bug could be in the if-elif-else block associated with the new_status and task status checks.

Reason for Bug: The bug may be related to the incorrect handling of status transitions, particularly when transitioning to a DISABLED status. The logic for handling status changes and associated conditions may not be correctly implemented.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we need to carefully analyze the logic associated with status transitions and ensure that the conditions and associated actions are correctly implemented. Additionally, we should consider refactoring the function to enhance readability and maintainability.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        if task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                # Notifications are sent outside the scope of this function

    elif new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    elif new_status == 'FAILED':
        if task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                # Notifications are sent outside the scope of this function

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
    return  # Optional, as the return statement depends on the specific requirements outside the scope of the provided code
```
