The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is checking for a scenario where a task is disabled and should not be re-enabled automatically after a certain period of time.

The error message indicates that the expected status of the task 'A' is 'DISABLED', but the actual status obtained from the `self.sch.task_list('', '')['A']['status']` is 'FAILED'.

It appears that the issue is related to the `set_status` method in the `SimpleTaskState` class. The method does not handle the scenario where a task is supposed to remain disabled and should not be re-enabled automatically.

The bug occurs because the `set_status` method is not correctly handling the transition to the 'DISABLED' status and re-enabling for the subsequent case.

To fix this issue, the logic within the `set_status` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the scenario where a task is supposed to remain in the 'DISABLED' status and should not be re-enabled automatically.

Below is the corrected `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED:
        if task.status != DISABLED:  # Check if the task is already in DISABLED state
            # Ensure that task can disable and has not excessive failures before disabling
            if task.can_disable() and not task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.status = DISABLED
                task.scheduler_disable_time = None
                self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
                self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        return  # Exit function to avoid further checks if the new status is DISABLED

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:  # Re-enable the task only if the new status is DONE
            self.re_enable(task)

        # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            # Send error email and handle excessive failures

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these modifications, the function should handle the scenario described in the test case properly, ensuring that a disabled task remains in the disabled state and is not re-enabled automatically after the specified period.
