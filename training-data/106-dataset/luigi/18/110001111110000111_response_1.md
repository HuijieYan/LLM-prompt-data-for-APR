Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring at the `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` function. Specifically, the `self.assertEqual(DISABLED, self.sch.task_list('', '')['A']['status'])` assertion is failing because the status is being set to `'FAILED'` instead of `'DISABLED'`. This indicates that the `set_status` function is not correctly handling the transition to a disabled status.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `set_status` function is not correctly setting the status to `'DISABLED' under certain conditions (e.g., excessive failures). As a result, the test case is expecting the status to be `'DISABLED' after a certain period of time, but it remains set to `'FAILED' instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions under which the status is being set to `'DISABLED' in the `set_status` function and ensure that it is being handled properly.
2. Verify that the logic for re-enabling a task after a period of time is correctly implemented and that it is working as expected.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures(config):
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the `re_enable` function is called with the `config` argument, and the `has_excessive_failures` function is also passed the `config` argument. Additionally, the conditions for setting the status to `'DISABLED' have been carefully reviewed to ensure that it behaves correctly based on the given conditions.
