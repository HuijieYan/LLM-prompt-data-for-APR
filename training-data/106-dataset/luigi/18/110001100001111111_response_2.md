The buggy function `set_status` has several issues. It is not correctly updating the task status and managing scheduler_disable_time when the status changes to DISABLED or FAILED. Additionally, there are potential logical errors in the if-else conditions.

The function first needs to check if the new status is FAILED and if the config is not None. If the status changes to DISABLED, it should set the scheduler_disable_time accordingly. 

To fix the bug:
1. The condition for checking `FAILED` status should use quotes around `FAILED` as it is a string.
2. In the case of `new_status = DISABLED`, the function should set `scheduler_disable_time` to the current time if the scheduler_disable_time is not already set.
3. Making sure that the `if-elif-else` logic considers all the possible combinations of status changes.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == 'DISABLED':
        if task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() if task.scheduler_disable_time is None else task.scheduler_disable_time
    elif new_status == 'DONE' and task.status == 'DISABLED':
        self.re_enable(task)
    elif new_status == 'FAILED' and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        if task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                config.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
                new_status = 'DISABLED'

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
