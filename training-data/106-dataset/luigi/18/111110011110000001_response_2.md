The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` sets up a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures` set to 2 and `disable_persist` set to 100. It then adds a task with the ID 'A' and sets its status to `FAILED` twice, which should result in the task being `DISABLED`. However, it fails to remain disabled after it has been manually set to disabled.

The error message indicates that the final status of the task 'A' is `FAILED` instead of `DISABLED`.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the logic involving the transition of the task status to `DISABLED` based on the number of failures and the elapsed time.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for transitioning the task status to `DISABLED` based on excessive failures and the elapsed time is not functioning as intended.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the logic for transitioning the task status to `DISABLED` so that it accurately reflects the conditions specified (e.g., number of failures, elapsed time).

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status != DISABLED:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures() and time.time() - task.last_failure_time > config.disable_window:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status == new_status:
        return

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id, None)
    self._status_tasks.setdefault(new_status, {})[task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for transitioning the task status to `DISABLED` based on excessive failures and the elapsed time has been updated to prevent the task from being re-enabled after it has been manually set to disabled.
