The error occurs in the `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` test case. The test fails because the status of task 'A' is expected to be 'DISABLED' after 101 seconds, but the actual status is 'FAILED'. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition for setting the new status when the task has excessive failures. When the task has excessive failures, the status should be set to 'DISABLED', but it seems that the status is not being set correctly.

The bug occurs because when a task has excessive failures, the code correctly sets the new status to 'DISABLED', but it doesn't update the status of the task to 'DISABLED'. As a result, the task status remains as 'FAILED' instead of being updated to 'DISABLED'.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a task has excessive failures and its status is updated to 'DISABLED', the task status is also updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
            task.status = DISABLED  # Update the task status to DISABLED
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, when a task has excessive failures and its status is updated to 'DISABLED', the task status is also updated to 'DISABLED' accordingly.
