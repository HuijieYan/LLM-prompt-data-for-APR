The test case is checking to ensure that a task remains disabled after setting it manually. However, the error message indicates that the status of the task is not as expected.

The potential error in the code is the `set_status` function. Looking at the code, the issue might be in the condition where the status of the task is being set. The current implementation does not handle the case where the new status is DISABLED and the task status is already DISABLED. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not explicitly check for this condition and handle it accordingly. As a result, the task status is not updated properly.

To fix this bug, a new condition should be added at the beginning of the function to check if the new status is DISABLED and the task status is already DISABLED. If this condition is met, the function should return without making any further changes.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == DISABLED:  # new condition to handle the case where task is already disabled
            return
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    # remaining code for updating the status
```

By adding this new condition, the function will correctly handle the case where the task is already disabled, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
