Potential Error:
The issue in the provided code is that the function set_status is not handling all the conditions properly. There are inconsistencies in the logic flow for different status transitions, and the code is also missing necessary imports for FAILED, DISABLED, and time.

Reason for Bug:
The bug is occurring due to the inconsistent handling of status transitions and the missing checks in the set_status function. Additionally, there is a missing import for the time module, which is used in the function but not imported.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary modules such as time and any custom modules used in the function.
2. Ensure that all status transitions are properly handled with the correct logic flow.
3. Add necessary condition checks for status transitions to prevent unexpected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time
from notifications import send_error_email  # import the necessary notification module

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
