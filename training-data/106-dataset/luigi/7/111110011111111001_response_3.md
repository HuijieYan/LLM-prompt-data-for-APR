The test case `test_status_wont_override` tries to check if Worker Y can override the status of task A, which is currently running on Worker X, to UNKNOWN. The test uses the `add_task` method to try to achieve this.

The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure. The test is expecting the set of keys from the task list with status `RUNNING` to contain only the task ID 'A', but it seems that 'A' is not in the set.

The potential error location within the `add_task` method could be where it updates the status of the task. Based on the input parameter values and types for Buggy case 2 and Expected case 2, the function should properly handle changing the status of the task running on one worker to UNKNOWN when called by another worker.

The bug is occurring because the buggy function does not properly handle the change of task status when called by a different worker. The function is not correctly updating the status to UNKNOWN when called by Worker Y to override it from running on Worker X.

To fix this bug, the `add_task` method should properly handle the scenario where one worker tries to override the status of a task that is running on another worker. It should also make sure that the task status is updated correctly when the status is changed.

Here's the corrected `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, worker, task_id, status, **kwargs):
    task = self._state.get_task(task_id)
    
    if task is None:
        self._state.add_task(task_id, status)
    elif task.status == RUNNING and task.worker_running != worker:
        # Task is running on a different worker, update status to UNKNOWN
        task.status = UNKNOWN
    else:
        task.status = status
```

In this corrected method, we first retrieve the task from the task ID. If the task does not exist, we add it with the provided status. If the task exists and it's currently running but on a different worker, we update the status to UNKNOWN. Otherwise, we simply update the status of the task.

This correction ensures that the task status is handled correctly when one worker tries to override the status of a task that is running on another worker.
