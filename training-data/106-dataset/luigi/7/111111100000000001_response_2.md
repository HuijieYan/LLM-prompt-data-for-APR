The potential error in the problematic function `add_task` is the usage of `worker.enabled` without actually calling it as a method (it should be `worker.enabled()` instead of `worker.enabled`). Additionally, the variable `PENDING` has not been defined anywhere in the function and it should be converted to a string (e.g., `status='PENDING'`).

The bug likely occurred due to a missing method call on the `worker` object and the usage of undefined variables.

To fix the bug, the `worker.enabled` should be updated to `worker.enabled()` and `PENDING` should be updated to `'PENDING'` to signify a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled():
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled()):
        return

    # rest of the function...
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, the `worker.enabled` is updated to `worker.enabled()` to call the method, and the `PENDING` is updated to `'PENDING'` to signify a string.
