The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line - "if not task.family:". The code is written to handle the case when the 'task' object does not have a 'family' attribute initialized. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the absence of the 'family' attribute in the 'task' object properly, leading to a potential AttributeError when accessing 'task.family'.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to check if the 'family' attribute is present in the 'task' object before performing operations on it. If it is not present, then initialize it with the value from the input parameter 'family'.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if not hasattr(task, 'family') or not task.family:
        task.family = family

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```
In this corrected code, we first check if the 'family' attribute exists in the 'task' object. If it does not exist or is empty, we initialize it with the value from the input parameter 'family'. This approach ensures that we avoid potential AttributeError when using 'task.family'.
