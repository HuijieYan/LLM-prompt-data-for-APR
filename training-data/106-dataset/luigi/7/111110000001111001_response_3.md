The code has several issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, the function `add_task` has a decorator `@rpc_method()` that is not defined in the code. Additionally, the parameters `status=PENDING` and `retry_policy_dict={}` are assigned to mutable default arguments. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as changing these parameters will change them for all future function calls.

There is also an assertion `assert worker is not None` at the beginning of the function. If this assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError`, which may not be suitable for handling failures in production code.

Finally, there are several undefined variables and function calls in the function body.

To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:

1. Define the `@rpc_method()` decorator.
2. Avoid using mutable default arguments, for example by using `None` and then setting the default value within the function body.
3. Replace the `assert` statement with appropriate error handling using `if` conditions.

The corrected code for the `add_task` function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected add_task function
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=None, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict=None, owners=None, **kwargs):
    if status is None:
        status = 'PENDING'
    if retry_policy_dict is None:
        retry_policy_dict = {}

    if worker is None:
        # handle the case when worker is None
        return

    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```
