The error is occurring because the `add_task` function is not updating the status of the task `A` for Worker Y to `UNKNOWN` as intended, but instead it's retaining its previous status. This leads to the set comparison in the test failing.

The potential error location within the `add_task` function is the section where the status of the task is updated based on the input provided.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for updating the status of the task is not being executed properly. This could be due to incorrect conditional checks or improper assignment of the status.

To fix the bug, you should validate that the status of the task is being updated correctly when the `add_task` function is called with a new status for an existing task. You should also ensure that all relevant checks for task status and worker assignment are performed accurately.

Here's the corrected `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None:
        task = _default_task
    else:
        # Update the status of the task
        if status != task.status:
            self._update_task_history(task, status)
            self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)
            task.status = status

    # ... (other logic remains unchanged)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        # ... (continued logic remains unchanged)
    
    # Because some tasks (non-dynamic dependencies) are `_make_task`ed
    # before we know their retry_policy, we always set it here
    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

In the corrected function, after retrieving the task, the status update logic involves checking if the status provided is different from the current status of the task. If there's a difference, the history is updated and the status is set accordingly.

This approach ensures that when a new status is provided for an existing task, it is correctly updated in the system and will avoid the issue seen in the failing test case.
