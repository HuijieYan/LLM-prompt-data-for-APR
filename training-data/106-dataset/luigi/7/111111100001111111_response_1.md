The bug is likely occurring in the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class. In the provided input and expected cases, the expected values and types of various variables are different before and after the function returns, indicating that the function is not behaving as expected.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `status` of the task. In the expected cases, we can see that the `status` of the task should be updated based on certain conditions, but in the actual tests, the `status` is not being updated correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where the `status` of the task is being updated based on certain conditions.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the logic for updating the `status` of the task within the `add_task` method.
2. Ensure that the conditions for updating the `status` are correctly evaluated and that the `status` is updated accordingly.
3. Consider any potential edge cases where the `status` may not be updated correctly, such as when the complete() of the task fails or when the task reaches the task-limit.
4. Ensure that the `status` is updated consistently and accurately based on the defined conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, default=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != 'RUNNING' and not worker.enabled):
        return

    if status == 'PENDING' or status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, 'PENDING' if status == 'SUSPENDED' else status, self._config)

    # rest of the code...
```
In the corrected code, the conditions for updating the `status` of the task are evaluated correctly, and the `status` is updated based on those conditions. Additionally, the `status` is updated consistently and accurately based on the defined conditions.
