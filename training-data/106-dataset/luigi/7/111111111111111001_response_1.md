The error seems to be occurring because when worker Y tries to update the status of task A to UNKNOWN, it is not allowed to override the status that is already set to RUNNING by worker X. This is probably due to the condition in the buggy function:
```python
if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
    return
```
The reason for this behavior is that the status can only be updated if either the task is not present or if the task's status is not RUNNING and the worker is enabled.

To fix this bug, you should modify the condition to allow a change of status when the task's status is not RUNNING, regardless of the worker's enabled status. This will prevent one worker from being blocked by another worker's task status.

Below is the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):

    # ... [Other code] ...

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)
    
    if task is not None and (task.status != RUNNING or status != RUNNING):
        # Update the DB only if there was an actual change, to prevent noise.
        # We also check for status == PENDING because that's the default value
        # (so checking for status != task.status would lie)
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # ... [Remaining code] ...
```

In the corrected code, the condition for updating the status has been modified. Now the status will be updated if either the task is not present or if the task's status is not RUNNING, regardless of the worker's enabled status. This change should allow the workers to update the task statuses as needed.

This modification ensures that tasks can be updated to different statuses by different workers without conflicts.
