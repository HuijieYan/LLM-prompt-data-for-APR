The error in the `add_task` function seems to stem from how the function handles the status of a task when it is updated by a worker. The test case `test_status_wont_override` checks if a task's status is overridden when a worker updates it, but the actual behavior of the function does not match the expected outcome.

The bug likely occurs in the conditional block that handles the status update:
```python
if not (task.status in (RUNNING, BATCH_RUNNING) and status == PENDING) or new_deps:
    # don't allow re-scheduling of task while it is running, it must either fail or succeed first
    if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
        # Update the DB only if there was a acctual change, to prevent noise.
        # We also check for status == PENDING b/c that's the default value
        # (so checking for status != task.status woule lie)
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
    self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)
```
There are a couple of logical and control flow issues in this section of the function. The code seems to be checking for a specific status, but the logic might not accurately reflect the intended behavior. Additionally, there are comments indicating potential issues with the logic as well.

To address the issue, it's important to review the logic for handling the task status update. The function should accurately handle the status changes based on worker updates and ensure that the task's status is updated correctly without causing conflicts.

The corrected code for the `add_task` function is as follows:
```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    if status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

The corrected code simplifies the logic for updating the task's status and other attributes based on worker updates, ensuring that the task status is handled accurately without conflicts.
