The error in the test case `test_status_wont_override` is due to the incorrect behavior of the `add_task` method. The `add_task` method is supposed to update the status of a task, but it has some issues. It always sets the status to `UNKNOWN` if the conditions mentioned in the GitHub issue are met, even if the worker doesn't encounter any real issue with the task. This results in incorrect task status being set and causes the test case to fail.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of task status updates within the `add_task` method. It updates the status to `UNKNOWN` under specific conditions, which is not appropriate in all cases. This behavior could lead to incorrect task status updates and cause unexpected issues.

To fix this bug, the `add_task` method should be modified to handle the status update more appropriately. It should only update the status to `UNKNOWN` if there is a genuine issue with the task, such as failure in completing the task or its dependencies. Otherwise, it should update the status based on the actual worker's actions.

Here's the corrected version of the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code)

    # Check if the status update conditions are met
    if status == UNKNOWN:
        if self._config.task_limit_reached or self._complete_fails(task_id) or self._deps_fails(task_id):
            # Do not update status to UNKNOWN if the worker is encountering a genuine issue with the task
            return

    # Update the status of the task based on the worker's actions
    if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
    self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)
```

In the corrected code, we first check whether the conditions for setting the status to `UNKNOWN` are met. If so, and if there's a genuine issue with the task, we skip the status update. Otherwise, we update the status based on the actual worker's actions.

This approach ensures that the status is updated correctly based on the worker's actions, without being overridden inappropriately in cases where the worker is not encountering any real issue with the task.
