# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
What's the purpose of a worker telling the scheduler that a task has UNKNOWN status?
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
The scheduler correctly marks a task as UNKNOWN when it first encounters that task as a dependency of another task being updated. It's assumed the worker will eventually update the state of such new task with either PENDING or DONE.
But a worker can (AT ANY TIME!) also update the status to UNKNOWN on three conditions:
- when the scheduled tasks reach the task-limit (if the config is set)
- when the .complete() of the task fails
- when the .deps() of the task fails

I can understand the intention of providing a visual feedback on the scheduler page in those conditions, but I'd argue that is wrong in all 3 cases to update the scheduler's status and the reasons is simply because those conditions may represent a flaky/local reality of things and it shouldn't be reflected in the central scheduler.

I can give multiple examples of how things could go bad, but simply put because 1 worker can't run a complete(), it doesn't mean other workers can't. And if that's the case you'll have that "bad" worker continually overriding the actual scheduler's state with UNKNOWN, which could lead to a task instance running multiple times at once (it happened to us today).

If there's an actual coding issue where complete() fails systematically, I think it's ok for that task not to appear on the scheduler, after all that's the de facto unknown status of any task :)

Am I missing something here? Should I file this as an issue?
```
