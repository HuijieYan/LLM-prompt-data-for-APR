The error is occurring in the `test_status_wont_override` test function. The test is trying to add a task with a status of `UNKNOWN` using the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class. After adding the task, the test is checking the task list for tasks with a status of `RUNNING`, and it's expecting to find 'A' in the list. However, it's not finding 'A' in the list, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error location is the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class. There might be a logic issue in the function that's causing tasks with a status of `UNKNOWN` not to be properly added or listed.

The bug is likely occurring because the `add_task` method is not processing tasks with a status of `UNKNOWN` correctly. This is causing the task 'A' to not be properly registered as a running task when its status is updated to `UNKNOWN`. As a result, the test is failing because it's expecting 'A' to be in the list of running tasks.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic in the `add_task` method related to handling tasks with a status of `UNKNOWN`. It's important to ensure that tasks with this status are properly added to the list of running tasks when they are updated.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status="PENDING", runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Below is the corrected logic to handle tasks with status UNKNOWN
    if status == "UNKNOWN":
        return  # Do not add or update for tasks with status UNKNOWN
    
    # ... existing code ...
```

In this corrected version of the `add_task` method, we include a check for tasks with a status of `UNKNOWN`. If the status is `UNKNOWN`, the method simply returns without performing any further operations. This should prevent tasks with status `UNKNOWN` from being added or updated incorrectly.
