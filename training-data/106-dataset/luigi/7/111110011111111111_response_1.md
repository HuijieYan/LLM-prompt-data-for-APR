The test case `test_status_wont_override` is attempting to add a task with ID 'A' for worker 'Y' and set its status to `UNKNOWN`. However, the test expects that the task should still be in the `RUNNING` state, but it fails because the state is not as expected.

The bug seems to be in the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class, where it is incorrectly handling the status change to `UNKNOWN`. Based on the code and the test case, the issue appears to be related to the worker setting the task status to `UNKNOWN`, and this status change is not handled correctly by the scheduler.

The `add_task` method should handle the status change to `UNKNOWN` properly, according to the provided use case. It should update the status only if there was an actual change, keeping in mind that `UNKNOWN` status should not be directly overridden by the worker.

To fix the issue:
1. Check if the status is `UNKNOWN` before updating the task status. If the status is `UNKNOWN`, it should not be overridden.
2. Add a condition to handle the case when the status is `UNKNOWN` in the logic of the `add_task` method.

Here's the corrected `add_task` method:

```python
class Scheduler(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    @rpc_method()
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        # existing code...

        task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

        if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
            if status == UNKNOWN:
                return
            else:
                status_change = status != task.status
                self._update_task_history(task, status) if status_change else None
            self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

        # existing code...
```

With this correction, the `add_task` method will properly handle the case when the status is `UNKNOWN` and prevent the worker from overriding the scheduler's state with `UNKNOWN` inappropriately.
