The identified function seems to be encountering issues with the worker and task statuses. The function `add_task` is designed to add a new task and update its status, but it seems to be struggling with handling the worker and task statuses correctly.

The bug mainly seems to be related to the handling of tasks with a specific status and updating their history and state. Additionally, there are checks related to worker status and priority that might be leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated with more robust logic to handle the worker and task statuses properly. Additionally, checks related to worker status, priority, and the task's dependencies need to be thoroughly reviewed and updated.

The corrected code for the `add_task` function is as follows:

```python
class Scheduler(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @rpc_method()
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        """
        * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
        * if deps is not None, update dependency list
        * update status of task
        * add additional workers/stakeholders
        * update priority when needed
