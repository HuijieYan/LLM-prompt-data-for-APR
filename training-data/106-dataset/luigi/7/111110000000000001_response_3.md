The error in the provided function is that it is missing the imports for the `rpc_method` decorator and the `PENDING` status variable.

To fix this bug, you need to import the required modules and define the `PENDING` status variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from some_module import rpc_method

PENDING = "PENDING"

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    @rpc_method()
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        """
        * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
        * if deps is not None, update dependency list
        * update status of task
        * add additional workers/stakeholders
        * update priority when needed
        """
        assert worker is not None
        worker_id = worker
        worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
        retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

        # ... omitted code ...
```

By adding the necessary import statement and defining the `PENDING` status variable, this code fixes the bug in the `add_task` function.
