The bug seems to be occurring in the `add_task` method of the scheduler. The function seems to have several issues, including the potential for a task to have a status of `UNKNOWN` which may not be desirable. This status is likely being updated based on certain conditions such as when the scheduled tasks reach the task-limit, `complete()` of the task fails, or `deps()` of the task fails.

To fix the bug, you should review the logic around updating the task status to `UNKNOWN` and ensure that it aligns with the actual state of the task. Additionally, you may need to consider handling the potential issues such as `complete()` and `deps()` failures in a way that does not result in an inaccurate task status.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    #... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
