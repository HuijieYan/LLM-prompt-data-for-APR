The error in the given function `add_task` is that it has an assertion `assert worker is not None`, but then it uses `worker_id` without actually using the `worker_reference` parameter. This can lead to potential errors if `worker` is None but `worker_id` is used.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that `worker` is always not None based on the assertion, but it doesn't actually handle the case where `worker` is None. This can lead to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to properly handle the case where `worker` is None. This can be done by adding a check for `worker is not None` before using `worker_id`.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    if worker is not None:
        worker_id = worker
        worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
        retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

        if worker.enabled:
            _default_task = self._make_task(
                task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
                priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
            )
        else:
            _default_task = None

        task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

        if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
            return
    else:
        # Handle the case where worker is None
        return
    # The rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By adding a check for `worker is not None` before using `worker_id`, we can prevent potential errors if `worker` is actually None.
