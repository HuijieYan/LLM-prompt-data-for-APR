The error occurs when the test function `test_status_wont_override` is executed. The test function is trying to add a task with `status=UNKNOWN`, but the task is already running with worker 'X'. This results in the task being overridden with status `UNKNOWN`, leading to the assertion error in the test.

The potential error in the function `add_task` is in the section where it handles the status update. The condition `if status == PENDING or status != task.status` is not correctly handling the status update logic, which leads to incorrect status updates.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the status update properly when a worker tries to update the status of a task that is already running. This leads to incorrect status updates and assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the status update logic needs to be modified to correctly handle the scenario where a worker tries to update the status of a task that is already running. This can be achieved by checking if the task is already running and ensuring that the status update is only allowed under specific conditions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status == RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # Update status only if the task is not running or if status is different from the current status
    if status != RUNNING or status != task.status:
        # Update the DB only if there was an actual change, to prevent noise.
        # We also check for status == PENDING because that's the default value
        # (so checking for status != task.status would lie)
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that the status is only updated under specific conditions, preventing incorrect status updates when a worker tries to update the status of a task that is already running.
