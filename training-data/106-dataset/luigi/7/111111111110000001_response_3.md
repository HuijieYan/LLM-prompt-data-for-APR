The potential error in the `add_task` function is that it's not setting the status correctly when a new status is provided. It's using the `status` parameter as if it's an integer constant (e.g., RUNNING) rather than a string. This is leading to the status not being updated correctly.

The error message from the test function indicates that the task 'A' is not present in the expected set, which suggests that the status of the task 'A' is not being updated to UNKNOWN as expected.

To fix this bug, the `add_task` function needs to correctly update the status of the task when a new status is provided.

Here's the corrected `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True, deps=None, new_deps=None,
             expl=None, resources=None, priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None, batch_id=None,
             retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):

    # ... existing code ...

    # Update the status of the task if a new status is provided
    if status is not None and task.status != status:
        # Update the DB only if there was a actual change to prevent noise.
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, status)

    # ... existing code ...
```

In the corrected function, the status is updated using the `set_status` method with the new status. Additionally, the function now correctly handles the string representation of the status, avoiding the use of integer constants.
