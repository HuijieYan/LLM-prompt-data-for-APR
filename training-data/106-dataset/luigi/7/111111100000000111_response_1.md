The potential error in the provided function seems to be the usage of the "status" variable in the "add_task" method. The "status" variable is used without being defined in the method arguments or referred to from an outer scope.

The "status" variable should either be defined as an argument in the method signature or accessed from an outer scope. It seems like the intended behavior was to have "status" passed in as an argument to the method.

To fix this bug, the "status" variable should be added as an argument to the method signature. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all variables used are properly defined and handled.

Here is the corrected code for the "add_task" method:

```python
# corrected add_task method
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=None, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=status, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected code, the "status" variable is added as an argument to the method signature, and it is used as intended throughout the method. Additionally, other variables and their usage should also be reviewed to ensure consistent behavior.
