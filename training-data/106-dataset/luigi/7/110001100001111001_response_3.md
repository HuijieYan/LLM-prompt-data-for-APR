The provided function `add_task` has multiple issues:
1. The function is defined within a class but does not have `self` as the first parameter.
2. The parameter `status` is used but has not been defined earlier in the function arguments, causing a NameError.
3. Many variables within the function are being used without being defined or instantiated, leading to potential errors.

To fix the issues with the `add_task` function, we should:
1. Define the `add_task` function within the class and include `self` as the first parameter.
2. Define the `status` parameter in the function arguments to avoid the NameError.
3. Ensure that all variables within the function are defined or instantiated before usage.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `add_task` function:

```python
class Scheduler:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        worker = self.get_worker(worker)
        worker_id = worker.id
        retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

        if worker.enabled:
            _default_task = self._make_task(
                task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
                priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
            )
        else:
            _default_task = None

        task = self.get_task(task_id, default=_default_task)

        if task is None or (task.status != 'RUNNING' and not worker.enabled):
            return

        # (rest of the function remains the same)
```
In this corrected implementation, the `add_task` function is defined within the `Scheduler` class, and the `status` parameter is included in the function arguments with a default value to avoid the NameError. Additionally, the use of `worker` and other variables is reviewed to ensure they are properly defined or instantiated within the function.
