The buggy function needs to be fixed to prevent workers from updating the status of a task to UNKNOWN. This behavior can lead to issues where the scheduler's state is overridden, potentially causing tasks to run multiple times at once.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None:
        return

    if task.status != 'RUNNING' and not worker.enabled:
        return

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This correction ensures that the task status is not overridden to UNKNOWN and prevents potential issues with task duplication. This fix aligns with the expected behavior as described in the issue report.
