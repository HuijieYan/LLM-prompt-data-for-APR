Potential Error Location:
The "worker" variable is not being used correctly in the function. It is passed as an input parameter, but it is not being used to update any worker-specific information.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the "worker" parameter is passed as input, but the function does not utilize this parameter's information. This inconsistency results in irrelevant input being passed to the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Incorporate the "worker" parameter into the function's logic, ensuring that the worker's specific information is updated or utilized appropriately within the function.
2. If the "worker" parameter is not intended to be used in this function, it can be removed from the function's input parameters to avoid confusion and potential misuse.

Corrected Code:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None  # Ensuring that "worker" is not None
    worker_id = worker  # Assigning the worker's id

    # Rest of the function implementation here...
```

In the corrected code, the "worker" variable has been removed from the function's input parameters since it was not being used within the function. If the worker's information needs to be utilized, it should be incorporated into the relevant parts of the function's logic.
