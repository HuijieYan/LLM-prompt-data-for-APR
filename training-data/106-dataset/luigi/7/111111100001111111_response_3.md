This buggy function is designed to add a task to the scheduler. The function takes in various parameters and then processes them to update the task's status, dependencies, and other attributes.

The potential error location in the code is where the task status is being updated to 'UNKNOWN' based on certain conditions. This is where the bug lies because updating the status to 'UNKNOWN' can lead to incorrect scheduling decisions and potential issues with task execution.

The reason behind the bug is that the status 'UNKNOWN' should not be set by the worker unconditionally. It should be set only under specific conditions as described in the associated detailed issue description.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the conditions where the status should be set to 'UNKNOWN' more carefully. It should not be updated unconditionally, but rather based on specific failure conditions as mentioned in the associated detailed issue description.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):

    # Existing code

    if status == 'UNKNOWN':
        if (worker.reach_task_limit() or 
            task.complete_fails() or 
            task.deps_fails()):
            return  # Do not update the status to UNKNOWN under these conditions

    # Existing code
```

In the corrected code, the status 'UNKNOWN' is updated only under the specific conditions where it is appropriate, as described in the issue description. This change ensures that the scheduler's state is not overridden with 'UNKNOWN' status under arbitrary conditions.
