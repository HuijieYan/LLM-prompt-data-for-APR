The test case `test_status_wont_override` is trying to assert that a task with status `UNKNOWN` is in the task list. However, the test fails because it doesn't find the task with status `UNKNOWN` in the task list, even though it was set to `UNKNOWN` in the `add_task` function.

The potential error location within the `add_task` function is that the status comparison and status update logic may not be functioning as expected. This is likely causing the status of the task to not be updated correctly, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs because the `add_task` function has complex logic for updating the task status based on various conditions, and it seems that this logic is not correctly setting the status to `UNKNOWN` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to carefully review the logic inside the `add_task` function that handles task status updates. It's important to ensure that the status is correctly set to `UNKNOWN` when specified in the function call.

Here's the corrected `add_task` function:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None:
        return

    if status != task.status and status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, 'PENDING' if status == 'SUSPENDED' else status, self._config)

    # rest of the existing code...
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the status comparison and update are done correctly, and the task status is appropriately set to `UNKNOWN` when specified in the function call.

After making this correction, the test `test_status_wont_override` should pass as expected.
