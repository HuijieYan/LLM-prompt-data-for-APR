Potential error location: The potential error location is in the add_task function. 

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the add_task function is not properly updating the status of the task when a new status is provided. This is causing the test to fail, as the status is not being overridden as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The add_task function needs to be modified to properly update the status of the task when a new status is provided. This can be achieved by checking if the new status is different from the current status of the task and then updating the status accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
