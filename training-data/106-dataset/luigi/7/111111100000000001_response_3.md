The potential error in the given code is that the `PENDING` value is not defined. This causes an undefined error as `PENDING` is used as a default value for the `status` parameter in the `add_task` function.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `PENDING` value before using it as a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
from enum import Enum

class TaskStatus(Enum):
    PENDING = 1
    RUNNING = 2
    FAILED = 3
    SUSPENDED = 4
    DISABLED = 5

class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    @rpc_method()
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=TaskStatus.PENDING, runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        """
        * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
        * if deps is not None, update dependency list
        * update status of task
        * add additional workers/stakeholders
        * update priority when needed
        """
        # remaining code...
    ```
With the use of the `Enum` class, we define the `TaskStatus` enumeration to include status values such as `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `FAILED`, `SUSPENDED`, and `DISABLED`. This allows us to use `TaskStatus.PENDING` as the default value for the `status` parameter in the `add_task` function.
