The bug is likely occurring in the `add_task` method of the `luigi.scheduler.Scheduler` class. The current implementation updates the scheduler's status to UNKNOWN in certain conditions, which can lead to incorrect behavior and task duplication.

The worker is updating the status to UNKNOWN when certain conditions are met, such as reaching the task-limit, failure of the `.complete()` method, or failure of the `.deps()` method. This can lead to incorrect status updates in the central scheduler, causing tasks to run multiple times simultaneously.

To fix this bug, it's recommended to review the conditions under which the status is updated to UNKNOWN and consider whether it's necessary to update the status in those cases. It might be more appropriate to handle these conditions differently, such as omitting the task from the scheduler if the complete() method fails systematically.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    if status in [PENDING, SUSPENDED]:
        self._update_task_history(task, status, task.status)

    if status == FAILED and self._config.batch_emails:
        batched_params, _ = self._state.get_batcher(worker_id, family)
        if batched_params:
            unbatched_params = {
                param: value
                for param, value in six.iteritems(task.params)
                if param not in batched_params
            }
        else:
            unbatched_params = task.params
        try:
            expl_raw = json.loads(expl)
        except ValueError:
            expl_raw = expl

        self._email_batcher.add_failure(
            task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, expl_raw, owners)
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            self._email_batcher.add_disable(
                task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, owners)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        # Task dependencies might not exist yet. Let's create dummy tasks for them for now.
        # Otherwise the task dependencies might end up being pruned if scheduling takes a long time
        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    # Because some tasks (non-dynamic dependencies) are `_make_task`ed
    # before we know their retry_policy, we always set it here
    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
