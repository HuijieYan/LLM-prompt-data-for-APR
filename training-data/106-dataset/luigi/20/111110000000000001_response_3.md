Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the for loop where it attempts to access the `significant` attribute of the parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is likely caused because the `significant` attribute is not being accessed correctly, and there might be issues with the usage of `param_kwargs` and `serialize` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the `significant` attribute is being accessed correctly and if it exists in the `Parameter` class.
- Verify the usage of `param_kwargs` and `serialize` method to ensure they are being used properly.
- Ensure that the `get_params` method is returning the parameters in a format that can be used by the `to_str_params` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(params):
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
    
    return params_str
```
