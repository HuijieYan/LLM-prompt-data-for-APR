The bug in the provided function is that it tries to access `self.param_kwargs`, which is not a valid attribute in the given context. Instead, it should be accessing `self` directly. Additionally, the `get_params` method needs to be corrected to a class method for it to work as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.param_kwargs` is not a valid attribute. The `param_kwargs` attribute is expected to contain the task class's parameters, but it's not a standard attribute in the Luigi Task class.

To fix the bug, the `get_params` method should be corrected to a class method and `self.param_kwargs` should be replaced with `vars(self)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in vars(self).items():
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```

In this corrected code, `vars(self)` is used to access the attributes of the `self` object, which contains the parameters of the class.
Additionally, the `get_params` method should be corrected to a class method to work properly for all instances of the class.
