The potential error in the provided code is within the `to_str_params` method. The `self.get_params()` call is incorrect, as it should be `cls.get_params()`. Also, the `param_kwargs` attribute is not defined anywhere in the code, so it needs to be replaced with `self._parameters`.

The `get_params` method is also incorrectly defined with a `cls` argument but it's not being used or accessed within the function.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Incorrect use of `self.get_params()` instead of `cls.get_params()`
2. Incorrect attribute `self.param_kwargs` which should be replaced with `self._parameters`

To fix the bug, the corrected code is as follows:

```python
def get_params(cls):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@six.add_metaclass(Register)
class Task(object):
    """
    ... (omitted for brevity)
    """

    # ... (omitted for brevity) ...

    @classmethod
    def get_params(cls):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def to_str_params(self):
        """
        Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
        """
        params_str = {}
        params = dict(self.get_params())
        for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self._parameters):
            if params[param_name].significant:
                params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

        return params_str
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `get_params` method is moved outside of the class and defined as a class method, and `cls` argument is used within the function.
2. Inside the `to_str_params` method, `self.get_params` is replaced with `dict(self.get_params())`.
3. The `param_kwargs` is replaced with `_parameters`, which seems to be the parameters associated with the task.
