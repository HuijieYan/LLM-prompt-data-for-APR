Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the loop where the task parameters are being checked for significance. The error occurs because the "insignificant_param" is being included in the final params_str, whereas it should have been excluded as per the intended behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the loop does not correctly exclude insignificant parameters. This is causing the "insignificant_param" to be included in the final params_str, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop to properly exclude insignificant parameters from being added to params_str. We can achieve this by checking for significance and only including significant parameters in params_str.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all significant parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if param_name in params:
            if params[param_name].significant:
                params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```

With this correction, only the significant parameters will be included in the params_str, resolving the issue of including the "insignificant_param" in the final output.
