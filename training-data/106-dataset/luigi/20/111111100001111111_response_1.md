The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop where the parameters are being processed. It seems that the code is not handling insignificant parameters correctly, which is causing an error when the serialised task is passed back to from_str_params.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is filtering out insignificant parameters, but it's not handling the case where these parameters are needed later on.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle insignificant parameters in the `to_str_params` function. We should not filter out these parameters, but instead include them in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_str_params` function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
    
    return params_str
```

This code removes the dependency on the `get_params` method, which was causing issues, and directly converts all parameter values to strings. This ensures that all parameters, including insignificant ones, are included in the output.
