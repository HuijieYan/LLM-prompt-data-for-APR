# Buggy function source code

    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Fix task_to_str_to_task behaviour when a Task has insignificant parameter
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Fixes issue introduced by a923a75 and adds a test case to avoid it in the future.

In a923a75, I removed insignificant parameters to be included in the output of to_str_params. It seems this was a bit careless, i.e. it causes an error when the serialised task is passed back to from_str_params.

The goal of a923a75 was to avoid passing insignificant params to scheduler and thus potentially avoid exposing it to users via UI. I guess I can come with another, less invasive way to achieve that. (possibly in another PR)
