The error is occurring in the `from_str_params` method of the `DummyTask` class, which is trying to access a key in the `params_str` dictionary that doesn't exist. This suggests that the `to_str_params` method of the `DummyTask` class is not including the `insignificant_param` in the `params_str` dictionary, which is causing the error when trying to reconstruct the task from the serialized parameters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `to_str_params` method is not including the `insignificant_param` in the serialized parameters, but the `from_str_params` method is expecting it to be present when deserializing the task.

To fix the bug, the `to_str_params` method should include all parameters, including insignificant ones, in the `params_str` dictionary to ensure that they are available when deserializing the task using the `from_str_params` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_str_params` method:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    
    return params_str
```

By including all parameters in the `params_str` dictionary, the `from_str_params` method will be able to reconstruct the task correctly, and the test case should pass without errors.
