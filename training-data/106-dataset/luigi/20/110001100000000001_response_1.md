Potential error location: The error might be in the line `params = dict(self.get_params())`, where the `get_params` function is not being called properly within the class method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `get_params` function is not being called correctly within the `to_str_params` method, which results in the 'params' dictionary not being populated with the correct values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. If `get_params` is a class method, it should be called as `cls.get_params()` instead of `self.get_params()`.
2. If `get_params` is not supposed to be a class method, then it should be called as a regular function and not as a method of the class.

Corrected code:
```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())  # Assuming get_params is a class method based on the function signature
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    return params_str
```
