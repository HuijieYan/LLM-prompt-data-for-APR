Potential error location: The error is likely located in the loop that iterates over `self.param_kwargs`, as it tries to access `params[param_name].significant` and `params[param_name].serialize(param_value)`, which are not present in the implementation provided.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `get_params` method is referenced as a bound method instead of being invoked.
2. The usage of `params` in the buggy loop is incorrect, as it should use `self.param_kwargs` to check for significant parameters.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Fix the invocation of `get_params` and store the result rather than trying to access it as a dictionary.
2. Replace the usage of `params` with `self.param_kwargs` within the loop.

Corrected code:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def get_params(cls):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = self.get_params()  # invoking get_params here
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if param_name in params and params[param_name].significant:  # modified this line
            params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)  # using str() for conversion
    
    return params_str
```
