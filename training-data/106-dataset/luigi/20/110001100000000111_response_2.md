Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the "to_str_params" method where it filters out insignificant parameters and then attempts to serialize the remaining parameters. This could potentially cause issues when the serialized task is passed back to "from_str_params."

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurred because the "to_str_params" method was filtering out insignificant parameters, which caused issues when attempting to deserialize the serialized task back to its original state.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of filtering out insignificant parameters in the "to_str_params" method, a better approach would be to include all parameters and their values in the serialization and handle the significance at a different level.
- Adding a test case to ensure that the serialization and deserialization process works correctly in the presence of both significant and insignificant parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_20/luigi/task.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_params(cls):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected "to_str_params" method
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    
    return params_str
```
