The potential error in the `to_str_params` function is in the line `params = dict(self.get_params())`. The `get_params` function is being called incorrectly, as it is defined to take a `cls` parameter but is being called with `self` instead.

The bug occurred because the `get_params` function is defined to take a `cls` parameter, indicating that it is a class method. However, when it is being called within the `to_str_params` function, it is being called as an instance method, hence resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_params` function to be a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator. This way, it can be called using the class itself rather than an instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_params` and `to_str_params` functions:

```python
@six.add_metaclass(Register)
class Task(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @classmethod
    def get_params(cls):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def to_str_params(self):
        """
        Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
        """
        params_str = {}
        params = dict(self.get_params())
        for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
            if params[param_name].significant:
                params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    
        return params_str
```
