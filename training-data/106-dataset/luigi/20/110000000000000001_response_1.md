The potential error location within the function is the use of 'self.param_kwargs' which is not defined within the function. This can result in an AttributeError or KeyError when trying to access 'param_kwargs'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- 'self.param_kwargs' is not defined within the function, so trying to access it will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If 'param_kwargs' is supposed to be an attribute of the class, it should be passed in as a parameter to the function or defined as an attribute of the class.
2. If 'param_kwargs' is not supposed to be used, it should be removed from the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def to_str_params(self, param_kwargs):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(param_kwargs):
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```
