The problem with the to_str_params method is the way it accesses the get_params method and the self.param_kwargs attribute. The get_params method should be a class method, but it's written as an instance method. Additionally, the logic inside the method is incorrect and doesn't match its intended functionality.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the get_params method is not correctly defined as a class method, and the logic to create the params_str dictionary is flawed.

To fix the bug:
1. Redefine the get_params method as a class method by using the @classmethod decorator.
2. Change the method name from get_params to _get_params to follow Python conventions for private methods
3. Change the logic inside the to_str_params method to correctly process the parameters.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_20/luigi/task.py

# relative function's signature in this file
class Task(object):
  
    @classmethod
    def _get_params(cls):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def to_str_params(self):
        """
        Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
        """
        params_str = {}
        params = dict(self._get_params())
        for param_name, param_value in self.param_kwargs.items():
            if params[param_name].significant:
                if isinstance(param_value, (list, tuple)):
                    params_str[param_name] = list(param_value)
                else:
                    params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
        return params_str
```
