Potential error location: The issue is likely occurring within the for loop that iterates through the param_kwargs and checks if the param is significant before adding it to the params_str dictionary.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the removal of insignificant parameters in the previous change (a923a75). This causes an error when the serialised task is passed back to from_str_params because it expects all parameters to be included.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Revert the code to include all parameters in the params_str dictionary.
2. Add a condition to check if the parameter is significant before including it in the params_str dictionary.

```python
# Corrected function
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if param_name in params and params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```
