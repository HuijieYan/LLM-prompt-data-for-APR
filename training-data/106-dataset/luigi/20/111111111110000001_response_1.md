The error is occurring because the `in` keyword is being used as a variable name in the test function, which is a reserved keyword in Python.

The issue in the `to_str_params` function lies in the line:
```python
params = dict(self.get_params())
```
The `get_params` function is not behaving as expected: it's supposed to return a dictionary of parameter names and their values, but it's a class method and it's not structured as a proper getter method.

To fix the bug, the `get_params` method should be modified to return the parameters as a dictionary. Additionally, a `significant` field is being accessed from the parameters inside the loop, but there is no indication that the parameters have the `significant` attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the `to_str_params` function:

```python
def get_params(self):
    # Assuming there is a list of parameters in the class
    return {param_name: getattr(self, param_name) for param_name in self._parameters}

def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = self.get_params()
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(params):
        params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
    return params_str
```
