The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to access the 'insignificant_param' key from the params_str dictionary in the from_str_params method of the DummyTask class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the to_str_params method. It seems that the 'insignificant_param' is not being added to the params_str dictionary, leading to the KeyError when trying to access it later.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not including the 'insignificant_param' in the params_str dictionary, and it is assumed to be present in the from_str_params method.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to include all params, including the 'insignificant_param', in the params_str dictionary in the to_str_params method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```

In this corrected code, the 'insignificant_param' will be included in the params_str dictionary, preventing the KeyError when accessing it in the from_str_params method.
