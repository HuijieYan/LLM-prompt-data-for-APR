Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the line `params = dict(self.get_params())`. This line is trying to call a function `get_params` as a method of the class, but it is not defined as a class method. Also, the commented-out code `# ... omitted code ...` suggests that there might be some missing code related to `get_params` as well.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `get_params` is not defined or implemented properly, and the current code is trying to use it as a method of the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `get_params` method properly within the class, so it can be called as `self.get_params()`.
2. Check for any missing code related to `get_params` and implement it if necessary.
3. Ensure that `param_kwargs` is defined and accessible within the class.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_20/luigi/task.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_params(self):
    # ... implement code to get params ...
    pass



# this is the fixed function
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())  # Assuming get_params is implemented correctly
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```
