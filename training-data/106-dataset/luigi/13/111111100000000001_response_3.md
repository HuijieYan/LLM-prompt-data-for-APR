Potential error location: The error is likely to occur in the `move` function when `raise_if_exists` is True and `new_path` already exists.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `move` function does not handle the case where `raise_if_exists` is True and `new_path` already exists. It checks if `new_path` exists using `os.path.exists`, but fails to take appropriate action when it does.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `raise_if_exists` is True and `new_path` already exists, and handle it accordingly.
2. Use `os.path.isfile(new_path)` to check if `new_path` is a file, and `os.path.isdir(new_path)` to check if it is a directory.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    if os.path.exists(new_path):
        if os.path.isdir(old_path):
            shutil.rmtree(new_path)
        else:
            os.remove(new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    shutil.move(old_path, new_path)
```
