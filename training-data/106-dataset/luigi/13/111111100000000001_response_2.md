Potential Error Location: The if statement checking if the new_path exists is incorrect. It should be using the old_path instead.

Reason Behind the Bug: The if statement is checking if the new_path exists instead of the old_path, which means that the code will incorrectly raise an error if there is an existing file at the new_path.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: Change the if statement to check if the old_path exists instead of the new_path.

Corrected Code:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        if os.path.exists(old_path):  # Check if the old_path exists
            d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
            if d and not os.path.exists(d):
              self.fs.mkdir(d)
            os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
