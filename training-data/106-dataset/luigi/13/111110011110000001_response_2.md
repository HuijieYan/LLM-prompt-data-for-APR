The error message suggests that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs', which is causing the AttributeError when the move function is called. This indicates that there is an issue with the 'self.fs' attribute within the move function of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

Upon examining the code, it seems that the 'LocalFileSystem' class is inheriting from a parent class called 'FileSystem', but the 'fs' attribute is not explicitly defined in the 'LocalFileSystem' class. This might be causing the AttributeError when trying to access 'self.fs'.

To fix this issue, we can directly call the 'mkdir' method instead of accessing 'self.fs.mkdir'. Additionally, the 'fs' attribute can be defined within the 'LocalFileSystem' class to avoid any future issues related to attribute access.

Here's the corrected code for the move function:

```python
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected move function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)  # Directly calling the mkdir method instead of accessing self.fs.mkdir
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With these changes, the move function should work correctly without raising an AttributeError.
