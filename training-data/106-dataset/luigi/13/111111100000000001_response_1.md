Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `move` function when checking if the `new_path` exists.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for the existence of the new path using `os.path.exists(new_path)` rather than `self.fs.exists(new_path)`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `self.fs.exists(new_path)` to check for the existence of the new path.
2. Update the `move` function to properly handle the existence of the new path.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and self.fs.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not self.fs.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
