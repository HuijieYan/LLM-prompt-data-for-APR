The error message indicates that the `LocalFileSystem` object has no attribute 'fs', which means that the code is trying to access the 'fs' attribute within the `LocalFileSystem` class, but it does not exist.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. The error occurs because the code is trying to access the 'fs' attribute, which is not defined within the `LocalFileSystem` class.

The bug occurred because the code incorrectly tries to access the 'fs' attribute within the `LocalFileSystem` class, which does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to remove 'fs' from the code and directly call the `mkdir` method on the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Update this line to directly call the mkdir method on the LocalFileSystem object
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the code should work as intended without trying to access the non-existent 'fs' attribute.
