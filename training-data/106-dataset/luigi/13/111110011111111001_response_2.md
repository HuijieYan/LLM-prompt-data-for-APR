The error is occurring because the code is trying to access `self.fs` which is not a valid attribute within the `LocalFileSystem` class. This is evident from the error message `AttributeError: 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'` which indicates that `self.fs` is not a valid attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to replace `self.fs` with `self` in the `move` method. The `move` method is already a member of the `LocalFileSystem` class, so there is no need to access `fs` in this context.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
# this is the corrected move function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this change, the `move` method will use the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class directly, and the error should be resolved.
