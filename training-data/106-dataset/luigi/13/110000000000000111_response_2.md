Potential Error Location: The potential error occurs when the function tries to check if the new_path exists and then raises a RuntimeError if it does, without considering the case when the old_path and new_path are the same.

Reasons for the Bug: The function does not handle the case when the old_path and new_path are the same. This can lead to the RuntimeError being raised even if the paths are the same, which is not the intended behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can fix the bug by adding a check to see if the old_path and new_path are the same before checking if new_path exists. If they are the same, then the function should not raise an error.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if old_path == new_path:
        return  # No need to move if old and new paths are the same
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
