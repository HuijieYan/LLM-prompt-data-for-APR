Potential error location: 
The error occurs because the `move` function is trying to access the `fs` attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object using `self.fs`. However, `LocalFileSystem` does not have an attribute called `fs`, which is causing the AttributeError.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `move` function is trying to access an attribute `fs` on `self`, assuming it exists, but it does not. This is resulting in the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to remove the reference to `self.fs` and directly use the methods provided by `LocalFileSystem` to achieve the move operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By directly calling `self.mkdir` instead of `self.fs.mkdir`, we eliminate the reference to the non-existent `fs` attribute and make use of the existing methods within the `LocalFileSystem` class.
