The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs' when trying to call 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' in the 'move' function. This means that 'self.fs' is not defined within the 'move' function, which is causing the AttributeError.

The potential error location within the 'move' function is the line 'self.fs.mkdir(d)'.

The bug occurred because the 'move' function is trying to access the 'fs' attribute of the 'LocalFileSystem' class using 'self.fs', but this attribute has not been defined or initialized within the 'move' function.

To fix this bug, we should replace 'self.fs' with 'self' since the 'mkdir' function is already a method of the 'LocalFileSystem' class and does not need to be accessed through 'fs'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By replacing 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' with 'self.mkdir(d)', we are correctly accessing the 'mkdir' method of the 'LocalFileSystem' class. This should resolve the AttributeError in the test case.
