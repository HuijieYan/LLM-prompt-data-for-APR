The error message indicates that the "LocalFileSystem" object does not have an attribute "fs", which implies that the code is trying to access the "fs" attribute from the LocalFileSystem object, but it does not exist.

The potential error location within the function is `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. The function is trying to access the "fs" attribute from the "self" object, which may not be correct.

The bug occurred because the code is trying to access an attribute "fs" from the "self" object, which does not exist. The correct attribute to access should be "self" itself since the "move" function is defined within the LocalFileSystem class.

To fix this bug, the "mkdir" operation should be performed on the "self" object directly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    # other methods...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            os.mkdir(d)  # Perform mkdir operation on the 'os' module directly
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By modifying the "self.fs.mkdir(d)" to "os.mkdir(d)", we ensure that the directory creation operation is performed using the "os" module without relying on the "fs" attribute of the "self" object.
