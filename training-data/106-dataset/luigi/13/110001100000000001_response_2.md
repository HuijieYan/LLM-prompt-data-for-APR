Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `move` function where it checks for the existence of the new path. 

Reason behind the bug: 
The function `move` does not handle the case where `new_path` and `old_path` are in the same directory, which can cause issues with the `os.rename` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if `old_path` and `new_path` are in the same directory, and if so, use `shutil.move` instead of `os.rename` to handle the case.
2. Handle the case where both paths are in the same directory and rename the file accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import shutil

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    
    old_dir = os.path.dirname(old_path)
    new_dir = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    
    if old_dir == new_dir:
        shutil.move(old_path, new_path)
    else:
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
