The error in the `move` function seems to be related to the attribute `self.fs` not being defined. 

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, it seems that the `move` function is trying to access `self.fs` to call the `mkdir` method. However, `self.fs` is undefined, which is leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to replace `self.fs` with `self` to call the `mkdir` method of the current object.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By using `self.mkdir(d)` instead of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, we can directly call the `mkdir` method of the current object, avoiding the AttributeError that was being encountered.
