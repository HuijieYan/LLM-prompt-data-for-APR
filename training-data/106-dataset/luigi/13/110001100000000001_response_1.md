Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is within the move function, specifically in the condition where it checks if the new_path exists and the raise_if_exists argument is True. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to check if the new_path exists is incorrect. It should check if the new_path exists and the raise_if_exists argument is True, rather than just checking if the new_path exists.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to correctly check if the new_path exists and the raise_if_exists argument is True before raising an error.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

class File:
    # ... omitted code ...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
