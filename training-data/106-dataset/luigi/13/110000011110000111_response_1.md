The error message indicates that the AttributeError occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. This suggests that the issue lies in the use of `self.fs` within the `move` method.

The potential error location within the `move` method is the use of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. It seems that `self.fs` does not have an attribute `fs` which is causing the AttributeError.

The bug occurred because `self.fs` is being used as if it has an attribute `mkdir`, but it does not. This is likely a mistake and should be corrected to use the correct method to create a directory in the file system.

To fix the bug, the `mkdir` method should be called directly on `os` instead of `self.fs`. Additionally, it's also necessary to import the `os` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
import os 

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
In this corrected code, `os.makedirs(d)` is used to create the directory rather than `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
