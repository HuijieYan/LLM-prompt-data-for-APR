## Analysis
The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being accessed in the 'move' method.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error is in the 'move' method where 'self.fs' is being accessed.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because the 'move' method is trying to access 'self.fs', but the 'LocalFileSystem' class does not have an attribute called 'fs'.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
The 'move' method should directly use the 'self' reference to access the methods and attributes of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

## Corrected Code
```python
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the fixed function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
