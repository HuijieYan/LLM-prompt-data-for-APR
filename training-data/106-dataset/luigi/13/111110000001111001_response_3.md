The potential error in the `move` function is that it is checking if `raise_if_exists` is True and `new_path` exists before actually moving the file. This means that if the file exists, it will raise an error, but it isn't actually moving the file unless the error is raised.

One approach to fix this bug is to first check if `new_path` exists, then if it does and `raise_if_exists` is True, raise an error. If it doesn't exist or if `raise_if_exists` is False, then move the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if os.path.exists(new_path) and raise_if_exists:
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    
    if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(new_path)):
        self.fs.mkdir(os.path.dirname(new_path))
    
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
In this corrected code, we first check if `new_path` exists and if `raise_if_exists` is True. If so, we raise an error. Then, we check if the directory of `new_path` exists, and if not, we create it using `self.fs.mkdir`. Finally, we use `os.rename` to actually move the file.
