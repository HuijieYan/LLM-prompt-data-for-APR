The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'. This suggests that the code is trying to access an attribute 'fs' on the 'LocalFileSystem' object, but this attribute does not exist. 

Looking at the provided code, the problematic line is:
```python
self.fs.mkdir(d)
```
The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'LocalFileSystem' class does not have an attribute called 'fs'. It seems that the intention was to use the current class instance to call the 'mkdir' method, but 'fs' is not the correct attribute for that. 

To fix the bug, we should change 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' to 'self.mkdir(d)'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
