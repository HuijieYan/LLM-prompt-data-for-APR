The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'. This suggests that the 'self.fs' attribute is being accessed incorrectly within the 'move' method of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line 'self.fs.mkdir(d)'.

The bug is occurring because the 'fs' attribute is not defined within the 'LocalFileSystem' class, and therefore it cannot be accessed using 'self.fs'.

To fix the bug, the 'mkdir' method should be called directly on 'self' instead of 'self.fs', as follows:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
In this corrected code, the 'mkdir' method is called using 'self' instead of 'self.fs'. This should resolve the AttributeError issue encountered in the test function.
