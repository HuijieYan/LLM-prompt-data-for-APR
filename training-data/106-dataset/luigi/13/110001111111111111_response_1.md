The error message indicates that the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute called `fs`. This suggests that the reference to `self.fs` within the `move` method is incorrect and is causing the AttributeError.

The reason for this bug is that the code is trying to access `fs` as an attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object, but it should simply be accessing `self` directly as the `LocalFileSystem` object itself.

To fix this bug, the `move` method should be updated to use `self` instead of `self.fs` when calling the `mkdir` method.

Here's the corrected `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Updated line
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the `move` method should work correctly without causing the AttributeError.
