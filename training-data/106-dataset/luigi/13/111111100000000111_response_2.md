Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the `move` function where it checks for the existence of the new path using `os.path.exists(new_path)`. The current implementation does not handle cases where the new path points to a directory.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code only checks if the new path exists. If the new path is a directory, then `os.path.exists(new_path)` will return `True` even though it might not be the actual directory that is being moved to. This can lead to unexpected behavior when moving files to existing directory paths.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by using a more robust way of checking whether the new path is a directory or not. Instead of using `os.path.exists(new_path)`, we can use `os.path.isdir(new_path)` to check if the new path is a directory or not.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    if os.path.isdir(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination is a directory: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
