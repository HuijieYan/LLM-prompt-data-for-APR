Potential error location: 
The error occurs when the `raise_if_exists` parameter is `True` and `os.path.exists(new_path)` is `True`.

Reason behind the bug:
The error occurs because the logic to check if the file already exists at the new path is incorrect. The condition `os.path.exists(new_path)` should be `not os.path.exists(new_path)` to check if the file does not exist at the new path.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Change the condition `os.path.exists(new_path)` to `not os.path.exists(new_path)`.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and not os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
