The error message suggests that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called in the move method.

Upon analyzing the code, it is clear that the error is occurring due to the incorrect usage of 'self.fs' inside the move method. The 'self.fs' is not a valid attribute of 'LocalFileSystem' object, hence resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug:
1. Remove 'self.fs' and refer to the 'LocalFileSystem' directly within the move method.
2. Ensure that the necessary import statements are in place for the 'os' module.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import os

# corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
