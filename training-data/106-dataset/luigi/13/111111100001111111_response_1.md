Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring at the line `os.rename(old_path, new_path)` which is responsible for moving the file from `old_path` to `new_path`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `new_path` already exists and `raise_if_exists` is set to `False`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to add a condition to check if `new_path` already exists and take appropriate action based on the value of `raise_if_exists`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    if os.path.exists(new_path):
        if raise_if_exists:
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        else:
            os.remove(new_path)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
