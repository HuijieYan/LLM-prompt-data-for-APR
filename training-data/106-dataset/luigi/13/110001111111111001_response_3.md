The error occurs in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates that the AttributeError is raised because the `LocalFileSystem` object has no attribute 'fs', suggesting that 'self.fs' is incorrect. It seems that the `LocalFileSystem` object itself is being referenced as `self.fs`, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect reference to `self.fs` and directly call the methods of the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, the `move` method now directly calls the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` object instead of referencing `self.fs`. This should fix the bug and address the AttributeError issue.
