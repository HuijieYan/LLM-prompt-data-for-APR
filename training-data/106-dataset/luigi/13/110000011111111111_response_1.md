The bug occurred because the `move` method is a member of the `LocalFileSystem` class, so using `self.fs` to refer to the file system object is incorrect. The correct reference should be `self`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            os.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In this corrected code, the `move` method is defined within the `LocalFileSystem` class, and the method uses `os` module functions instead of `self.fs`.
