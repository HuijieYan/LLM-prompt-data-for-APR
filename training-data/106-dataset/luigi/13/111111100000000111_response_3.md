Potential error location: The potential error in the buggy function is with the usage of `os.path.exists(new_path)` and `os.path.dirname(new_path)` without importing the `os` library.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `os` library is not imported in the LocalFileSystem class, resulting in the function not being able to access the `os` methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `os` library at the beginning of the file to ensure that the function can access the `os` methods.
2. Use the `os.path.exists(new_path)` and `os.path.dirname(new_path)` after importing the `os` library.

Corrected code:

```python
import os  # Import the os library

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
