Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the provided function is the os.rename(old_path, new_path) line. This is where the function attempts to move the file from the old path to the new path.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the new_path already exists and the raise_if_exists parameter is set to True. The function should raise an error in this case, but it currently does not do so.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check for the existence of new_path when raise_if_exists is True, and raise an error if it already exists. We also need to handle the case where the new_path is within a directory that does not yet exist, and create the directory if necessary.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise FileExistsError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
    os.replace(old_path, new_path)
```
