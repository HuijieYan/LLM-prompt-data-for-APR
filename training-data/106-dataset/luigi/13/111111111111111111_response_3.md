The error message indicates an AttributeError on the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` within the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error occurs because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`.

The bug occurred due to incorrect usage of `self.fs` instead of `self` within the `move` method. This suggests that the move method is intended to be called on an instance of the LocalFileSystem class and not an attribute of it.

To fix the bug, the `move` method should operate directly on the instance of the LocalFileSystem class.

Here's the corrected implementation of the move method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the `move` method will use `self.mkdir(d)` instead of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, and it will operate directly on the instance of the LocalFileSystem class.

After this correction, the `move` method should function as intended without raising an AttributeError.
