The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that in the `move` method, it is trying to access the `fs` attribute of `LocalFileSystem`, which does not exist.

To fix this bug, the access to the `fs` attribute should be removed, as it is not necessary for the implementation of the `move` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, the access to the `fs` attribute has been removed and replaced with a call to the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. This should resolve the `AttributeError` and fix the bug.
