Potential Error:
The potential error in the `move` function is that it does not handle the case where the `new_path` already exists, even when `raise_if_exists` is False. This can cause unexpected behavior and file loss.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if `raise_if_exists` is False before raising an error for existing `new_path`. This means that even if the condition is set to False, the error will still be raised.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `raise_if_exists` is True before raising an error for the existing `new_path`. If `raise_if_exists` is False, then we should either handle the case or simply not raise an error.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if not raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            return  # do nothing if new_path exists and raise_if_exists is False
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
