Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring within the `move` function when checking if the `new_path` exists. If `raise_if_exists` is `False`, the function should not raise an error even if `new_path` exists.

Reason behind the bug: 
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when `raise_if_exists` is `False`. The condition to raise an error is not appropriately handled.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks whether to raise an error and make sure it aligns with the value of `raise_if_exists` parameter.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    if not raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        return  # Do nothing and return if raise_if_exists is False and new_path exists
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
