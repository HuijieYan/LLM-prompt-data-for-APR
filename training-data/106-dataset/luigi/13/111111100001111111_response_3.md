The potential error in the `move` function lies in the condition `if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):`. This condition is supposed to check if `raise_if_exists` is True and if the new path exists, then raise a `RuntimeError`. However, in the given test case, `raise_if_exists` is False, so the condition will never be True, and the `os.path.exists(new_path)` check will not be executed. This means that the function will not raise an error even if the new path exists, which seems to be contradictory to the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `raise_if_exists` is True and then raise a `RuntimeError` if the new path exists. 

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the `move` function will now operate as intended, raising a `RuntimeError` if `raise_if_exists` is True and the new path already exists.
