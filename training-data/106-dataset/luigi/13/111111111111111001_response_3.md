The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when the `self.fs.mkdir(d)` line is executed. This error occurs because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute named `fs`.

The bug in the move function is that it tries to access a non-existent attribute `fs` of the `LocalFileSystem` object, but it should be accessing the methods directly without the `fs` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `move` function should directly call the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` object instead of accessing it through the `fs` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the move function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
