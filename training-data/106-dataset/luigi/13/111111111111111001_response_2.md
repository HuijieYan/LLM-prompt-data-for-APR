The error is occurring in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates that the `LocalFileSystem` object has no attribute 'fs', which suggests that `self.fs` is incorrectly referenced.

The bug occurred because the `move` method is attempting to reference the `fs` attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object, but this attribute does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `self.fs` with `self` since the `move` method is contained within the `LocalFileSystem` class and therefore does not need to reference `self.fs`.

The corrected `move` method is as follows:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
