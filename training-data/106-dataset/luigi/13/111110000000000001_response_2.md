Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line `if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):`. This is where the function is checking if `new_path` exists, but the check is not being performed using the `FileSystem` class's `exists` method.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is directly using `os.path.exists` instead of utilizing the `exists` method from the `FileSystem` class. This can lead to inconsistent behavior, especially if the `FileSystem` class has its own implementation for checking file existence.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should use the `exists` method from the `FileSystem` class to perform the check for the existence of `new_path`. This will ensure consistent behavior and prevent potential issues that may arise from using `os.path.exists`.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and self.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not self.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
