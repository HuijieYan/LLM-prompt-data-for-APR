The error message indicates an AttributeError in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` object. The error occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, which suggests that `fs` is not a valid attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Upon further inspection, it seems that the function is meant to be a method of the `LocalFileSystem` class, as indicated by the use of `self` as the first parameter. However, `self.fs` is not a valid attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` class, which is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the reference to `self.fs` and use the methods and attributes directly from the `LocalFileSystem` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            os.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In this corrected code, the `move` method is now a part of the `LocalFileSystem` class and does not reference `self.fs`. The `os.mkdir` method is used directly to create the directory, and `os.rename` is used to perform the file move operation.
