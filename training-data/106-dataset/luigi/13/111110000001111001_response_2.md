The bug in the `move` function is that it's not checking if the destination directory exists before moving the file to the new path. This causes an error because the `os.rename` function expects the directory to exist.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the directory of the new path exists, and if not, create the directory before moving the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
