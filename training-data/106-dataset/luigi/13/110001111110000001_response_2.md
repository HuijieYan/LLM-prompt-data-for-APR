Potential error location: 
The AttributeError occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` within the `move` function. This indicates that the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`, which is being incorrectly accessed in the `move` function.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`, so it should not be accessed using `self.fs`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the `.fs` from `self.fs.mkdir(d)` and directly call the `mkdir` function using `self`, as it is already a method within the class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    # ... other methods ...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)  # fixed access to the mkdir method
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
