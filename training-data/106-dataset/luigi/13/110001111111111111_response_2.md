Potential error location: The error occurs in the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` inside the `move` function. It seems that the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`, causing the AttributeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is calling `self.fs.mkdir(d)` assuming that `self` has an attribute `fs`, but in reality, it does not. This is likely a typo or incorrect assumption about the structure of the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `self.fs.mkdir(d)` with `self.mkdir(d)` assuming that `mkdir` is a method of the `LocalFileSystem` class.
2. If `fs` is indeed a valid attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object, then the error may be due to incorrect initialization or usage. In this case, the code for initializing the `LocalFileSystem` object may need to be reviewed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
