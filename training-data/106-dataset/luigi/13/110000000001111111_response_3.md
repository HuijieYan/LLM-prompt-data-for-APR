The bug in the provided code is that the `os.path.exists` check is performed before creating the directory, but the directory creation is only attempted if `d` has a non-empty value. This can lead to a race condition where the directory is created by another process between the `os.path.exists` check and the `self.fs.mkdir` call.

To fix this bug, we need to create the directory unconditionally using `makedirs` instead of `mkdir`, which will create the directory and its parents if they do not exist.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    os.makedirs(d, exist_ok=True)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this fix, the directory will always be created if it does not exist, and the potential race condition is avoided.
