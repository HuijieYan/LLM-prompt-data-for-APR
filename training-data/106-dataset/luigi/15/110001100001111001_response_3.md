The buggy function `get_necessary_tasks` is designed to return a set of necessary tasks based on their status. However, there is no definition for the `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses, which are used when checking the status of tasks. The task's status is checked in the if statement, and the `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses are compared to the task's status, which will cause a NameError as these statuses are not defined. 

To fix this issue, we need to define the `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses and update the comparison to use these defined status values. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    DONE = 'done'  # define the status
    DISABLED = 'disabled'  # define the status
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
