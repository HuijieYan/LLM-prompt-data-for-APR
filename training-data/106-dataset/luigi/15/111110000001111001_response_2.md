The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` and `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None`. The bug likely stems from the fact that `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined within the function, and the comparison with `task.status` may not be working as expected.

To fix the bug, we can assume that `DONE` and `DISABLED` are meant to be strings, and compare them with `task.status` as strings. We can also assume that `task` is an instance of a `Task` class, and the `deps` attribute is a set. With these assumptions, we can update the function accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database.
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
        

    # this is the corrected function
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
