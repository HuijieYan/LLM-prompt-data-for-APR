The error occurs when the test function is checking the set of tasks for certain statuses. The assertion fails for the 'unknown' status because the 'get_necessary_tasks' function is not properly filtering out tasks with 'UNKNOWN' status.

The potential error location is the 'get_necessary_tasks' function in the provided source code.

The bug occurs because the 'get_necessary_tasks' function is not correctly handling tasks with 'UNKNOWN' status. The function should only include tasks that have statuses 'PENDING' and 'FAILED', but not 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED'.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition in the 'get_necessary_tasks' function to filter out tasks with 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED' statuses. Additionally, the proper status values should be referenced directly from the test class for consistency.

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, UNKNOWN, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With these changes, the function would correctly filter out tasks with statuses 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED', resolving the bug.
