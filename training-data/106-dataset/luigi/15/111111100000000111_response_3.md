Potential error location: The get_necessary_tasks function is trying to call the get_active_tasks function, but there are multiple definitions of the get_active_tasks function in the code, which can cause ambiguity and incorrect behavior.

Reasons behind the bug: The get_necessary_tasks function uses the get_active_tasks function, but there are multiple definitions of the get_active_tasks function in the same class. This can lead to confusion about which get_active_tasks function should be called, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Remove the duplicate definition of the get_active_tasks function and consolidate it into a single definition.
- Use parameters for the get_active_tasks function to distinguish between different behaviors, if needed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks(status=None):  # Specify which get_active_tasks function to call
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
