The error message indicates that the 'unknown' tasks are present in the 'not_nurtured_statuses = ['DONE', 'UNKNOWN', 'DISABLED']' list after running the test case for the 'test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses' function.

The potential error location within the 'get_necessary_tasks' function is the condition 'if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)' where 'DONE' is referenced without being properly defined.

The bug occurred due to the presence of 'DONE' without being properly defined or imported in the 'get_necessary_tasks' function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to define 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' status constants at the beginning of the 'SimpleTaskState' class. For example:
```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    DONE = 'DONE'
    DISABLED = 'DISABLED'

    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (self.DONE, self.DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```

By defining 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' constants within the class and referring to them as 'self.DONE' and 'self.DISABLED' within the 'get_necessary_tasks' function, the bug is fixed.

This will ensure that the 'DONE' status is correctly referred to in the 'get_necessary_tasks' function.
