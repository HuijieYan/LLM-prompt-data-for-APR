The error occurs in the `test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses` test function. The error message indicates that the assertion for the not nurtured statuses, such as 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED', fails because the set is not empty as expected. This suggests that the function `get_necessary_tasks` is not returning the correct necessary tasks based on the given input.

The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. This condition is not correctly checking the status of the task.

The bug occurs because the comparison of `task.status` with `DONE` and `DISABLED` is not evaluating to True due to incorrect comparison values. Additionally, the conditions for `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None)` are not being properly handled.

To fix the bug, the comparison values for statuses should be changed to strings: `'DONE'` and `'DISABLED'`. Additionally, the condition `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None)` should be checked for the existence of the attribute.

The corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
