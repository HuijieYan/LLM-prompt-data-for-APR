Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the line `for task in self.get_active_tasks():` as `get_active_tasks` method does not take any arguments but it's being called with an argument `status` in the `get_necessary_tasks` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `get_necessary_tasks` method is calling the `get_active_tasks` method without passing the required `status` argument.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `get_active_tasks` method to accept an optional `status` argument, and then update the call to `get_active_tasks` in the `get_necessary_tasks` method to pass the required `status` argument.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected class declaration containing the fixed function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.

    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
