The error message indicates that the assertion for the set of tasks with status DONE, UNKNOWN, and DISABLED is failing. Specifically, the 'unknown' task is present in the set, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`, which is likely causing the issue. This condition excludes only the statuses DONE and DISABLED, but not UNKNOWN, leading to 'unknown' tasks being included in the necessary tasks set.

The bug occurs because the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` does not include the UNKNOWN status, causing tasks with an UNKNOWN status to be incorrectly included in the necessary tasks set.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN)`. This change will ensure that only tasks with status PENDING, FAILED, or RUNNING will be included in the necessary tasks set.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
