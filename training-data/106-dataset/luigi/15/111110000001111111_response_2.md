The issue seems to be with the conditions inside the for loop in the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The current conditions are checking for `task.status` instead of `task.status` with reference to the `SimpleTaskState` class. The conditions are also not checking for the `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses correctly.

The bug occurs because the conditions inside the for loop are not checking for the correct task status and not handling the retry configurations properly, which results in the necessary tasks set not being populated correctly.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditions inside the for loop to correctly check the task status and handle the retry configurations.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status() not in (TaskStatus.DONE, TaskStatus.DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id())
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `status()` method to get the task status from the `Task` class, and we are also using the `TaskStatus` constants to check for `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses. Additionally, we are accessing the `id()` method to get the task id from the `Task` class.

With these changes, the `get_necessary_tasks` function should now correctly populate the necessary tasks set based on the task status and retry configurations.
