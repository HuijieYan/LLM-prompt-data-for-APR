The test case `test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses` initializes a `CentralPlannerScheduler` object and performs various operations on it. At the end, it checks for the presence or absence of certain statuses in the task list. The error message indicates that the set comparison for some statuses is failing, specifically for the 'unknown' status.

Upon analyzing the provided function `get_necessary_tasks`, the error seems to be related to the logic used to check for the status of tasks before adding them to the `necessary_tasks` set.

The buggy function `get_necessary_tasks` iterates through the active tasks and checks their status. It then updates the `necessary_tasks` set based on certain conditions. However, there are two issues in the logic:
1. The status values such as 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' are being referenced without being defined or imported.
2. The code has a logical error where it checks if the task status is not in (DONE, DISABLED), which is incorrect usage.

To fix the bug:
1. Define or import the status values such as 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' from the appropriate module or class.
2. Update the logic to correctly check for the task status and include the valid status values.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    valid_statuses = {'DONE', 'DISABLED'}
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in valid_statuses or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
