Potential error location: The line `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` may cause an error if DONE and DISABLED are not defined or imported in the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The variables DONE and DISABLED are used in the if statement without being defined or imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define or import the variables DONE and DISABLED before using them in the if statement.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
