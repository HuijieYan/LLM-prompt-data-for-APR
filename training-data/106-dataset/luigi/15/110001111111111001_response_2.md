The potential error in the buggy function is the conditions inside the loop that determines the necessary tasks. The condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:` is leading to incorrect necessary tasks being identified. 

The reason behind the bug is that the condition is not correctly filtering out the statuses DONE and DISABLED. The usage of `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` seems unnecessary for this purpose.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to correctly identify the necessary tasks. We need to exclude tasks that are DONE or DISABLED and also exclude tasks with `scheduler_disable_time` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') and task.scheduler_disable_time is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
