Potential error location: 
The error might be in the line `for task in self.get_active_tasks():` where the `get_active_tasks()` method is called, but it's not clear if the need for arguments is satisfied.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `get_active_tasks` method in the `SimpleTaskState` class is defined with a required parameter `status` but is being called without providing this parameter. This inconsistency can cause the function to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `get_active_tasks` method to make the `status` parameter optional with a default value if it's not critical to the functionality.
2. If the status parameter is a critical part of the `get_active_tasks` method functionality, consider providing a default value for the `status` parameter in the `get_necessary_tasks` method.
3. Look at how the `get_active_tasks` method is intended to be used and determine the appropriate modification based on that usage.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # corrected function
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks(status="example_status"):  # Providing a default status parameter
            if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
