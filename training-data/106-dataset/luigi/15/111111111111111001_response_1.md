The test case `test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses` creates a `CentralPlannerScheduler` and adds tasks with various statuses such as `DONE`, `DISABLED`, `PENDING`, `FAILED`, and `UNKNOWN`. It then checks whether tasks with certain statuses are present in the scheduler's task list.

The error message indicates that the test fails when checking for the absence of a task with the status `UNKNOWN` in the scheduler's task list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_necessary_tasks` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. In this method, a task's status should not be equal to `DONE` or `DISABLED`, or the task should not have a `scheduler_disable_time` set to be considered a necessary task. However, in the current implementation, the `task.status` is being compared to `'DONE'` and `'DISABLED'` as string literals, and `task.id` is being added to `necessary_tasks` without checking its status or `scheduler_disable_time`.

The bug occurs because the `if` condition only checks for status equality with `'DONE'` and `'DISABLED'` as string literals, but the status is stored as a variable that must be used to access the correct attribute value.

To fix the bug, the `task.status` check should be replaced with the `status` variable provided to the `get_necessary_tasks` method. Additionally, the condition to add a task to `necessary_tasks` based on its status or `scheduler_disable_time` needs to be checked properly.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `get_necessary_tasks` method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self, status=None):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks(status=status):  # pass the status variable to get_active_tasks
        if status not in {'DONE', 'DISABLED'} or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:  # check status properly
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
