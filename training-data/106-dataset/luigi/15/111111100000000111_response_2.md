Potential Error Location:
The error is likely in the `get_necessary_tasks` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. The `get_active_tasks` method is being called without passing the `status` parameter, which seems to be required based on the signature of the method.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_active_tasks` method is being called without providing the required `status` parameter. This could lead to inconsistencies in retrieving the active tasks, which in turn affects the determination of necessary tasks.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `get_necessary_tasks` method to pass the `status` parameter when calling the `get_active_tasks` method.
2. Update the `get_active_tasks` method signature to make the `status` parameter optional, if applicable.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def get_necessary_tasks(self, status=None):  # Update with status parameter
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks(status):  # Pass status parameter to get_active_tasks
            if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
In the corrected code, the `get_necessary_tasks` method now accepts a `status` parameter, and it passes this parameter to the `get_active_tasks` method when retrieving active tasks. This ensures consistency and resolves the bug.
