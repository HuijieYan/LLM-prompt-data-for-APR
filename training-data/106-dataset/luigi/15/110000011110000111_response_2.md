The potential error in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is with the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` which is not properly handling the comparison with the status strings. The error message from the test function also indicates that the status 'UNKNOWN' is not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the comparison with status strings is not being handled properly. The status of the task is being compared directly with status strings like 'DONE', 'DISABLED', etc., which is leading to incorrect conditions being evaluated.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the task status with the actual status values, and handle the 'UNKNOWN' status as well.

The corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ['DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN'] or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

By comparing the task status with a list of status strings and handling the 'UNKNOWN' status, we can fix the bug present in the original function.
