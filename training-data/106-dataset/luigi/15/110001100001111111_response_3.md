The potential error in the code is in the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The code aims to retrieve the necessary tasks for execution, but it does not correctly identify tasks that are eligible for retry and hence necessary for execution.

The reason for the bug is that the `get_necessary_tasks` function does not handle the retry logic for failed tasks. It only checks for the status and the scheduler_disable_time attribute, but it doesn't consider retry configurations for failed tasks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_necessary_tasks` function to properly handle tasks that are eligible for retry. We should check if a failed task has a retry configuration and include it in the set of necessary tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            if task.status == FAILED and task.retry:
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With this modification, the `get_necessary_tasks` function will correctly include tasks that are eligible for retry in the set of necessary tasks for execution.
