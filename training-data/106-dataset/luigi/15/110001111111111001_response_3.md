The error "AssertionError: Items in the second set but not the first: 'unknown'" is occurring because the function `get_necessary_tasks` is not correctly identifying the "unknown" status tasks as necessary, which causes the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` because it is not accounting for the "UNKNOWN" status.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is not checking for the "UNKNOWN" status, hence the "unknown" tasks are not being added to `necessary_tasks`.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `get_necessary_tasks` function should be updated to include "UNKNOWN" status as follows:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
