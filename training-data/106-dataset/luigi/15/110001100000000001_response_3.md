Potential Error Location: 
The error might be in the if condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None`.

Reason for the Bug:
1. The function `get_necessary_tasks` is trying to access the attribute `status` of `task`, but the `task` object is not defined in the given code snippet.
2. It is also trying to access the attribute `deps` and `id` of `task`, but these attributes are not defined in the given code snippet.

Possible Fixes:
1. Define the `task` object before using it and ensure that it has the required attributes such as `status`, `deps`, and `id`.
2. Add error handling to check if the attributes are present in the `task` object before accessing them.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_15/luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected get_necessary_tasks function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    active_tasks = self.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        if hasattr(task, 'status') and hasattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time') and \
                task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            if hasattr(task, 'deps'):
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            if hasattr(task, 'id'):
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
