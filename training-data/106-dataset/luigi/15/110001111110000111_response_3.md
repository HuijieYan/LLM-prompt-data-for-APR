The error message indicates that the `set()` comparison in the test function is failing for the 'unknown' status. This implies that the `get_necessary_tasks()` function is not correctly handling tasks with the status 'unknown'.

The potential error in the problematic function lies in the logic that filters tasks based on status in the `get_necessary_tasks()` function. It seems that the bug is caused by not accounting for tasks with the 'unknown' status.

The bug occurs because the `get_necessary_tasks()` function only considers specific task statuses (DONE and DISABLED) while ignoring the 'unknown' status. As a result, the set comparison in the test function fails for the 'unknown' status.

To fix the bug, the `get_necessary_tasks()` function should be modified to include the 'unknown' status in the condition for filtering tasks. This will ensure that all relevant task statuses are accounted for.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks()` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
