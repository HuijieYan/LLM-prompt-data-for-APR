The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:`. 

The bug occurs because the condition is using `DONE` and `DISABLED` as variables, but they are not defined anywhere in the code, so the condition will always result in an error.

To fix the bug, we should define `DONE` and `DISABLED` as constants, and then use them in the condition. Additionally, we should change `task.status` to `task.get_status()` assuming `get_status()` is the method to retrieve the status of a task.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        DONE = 'done'  # define DONE constant
        DISABLED = 'disabled'  # define DISABLED constant
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.get_status() not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
