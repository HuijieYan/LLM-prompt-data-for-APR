The potential error in the given code is that the `get_active_tasks` function is defined twice in the `SimpleTaskState` class, which is not allowed. 

This can cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `get_active_tasks` function is used in the `get_necessary_tasks` function, but its return value and usage in the subsequent logic are not explicitly defined or handled.

To fix this issue, the duplicate `get_active_tasks` function should be removed. Additionally, the usage of the `get_active_tasks` function in the `get_necessary_tasks` function needs to be handled properly in order to utilize the `status` parameter for filtering tasks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    active_tasks = self.get_active_tasks()  # Assuming only one get_active_tasks function exists in the class
    for task in active_tasks:
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, the `get_active_tasks` function is assumed to exist once in the `SimpleTaskState` class, and it returns the required set of tasks. These tasks are then processed in the `get_necessary_tasks` function to determine the necessary tasks based on the specified conditions.
