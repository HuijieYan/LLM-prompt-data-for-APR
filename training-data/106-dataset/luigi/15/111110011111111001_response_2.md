The bug in the provided function `get_necessary_tasks` is likely to be caused by the comparison of the `task.status` with `DONE` and `DISABLED`. The comparison is not being made with string literals, leading to the inconsistency observed in the test case output.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be made with string literals for `DONE` and `DISABLED`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```

With this fix, the comparison `task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED')` ensures that the `task.status` is compared with the string literals 'DONE' and 'DISABLED', addressing the issue observed in the test case.
