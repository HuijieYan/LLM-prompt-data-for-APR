The error in the provided function `get_necessary_tasks` is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `task.status` attribute. The bug is occurring because the comparison is made with `task.status` and the attributes `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not properly defined within the function.

To fix this bug, the correct comparison should be made with the actual status string values instead of the identifiers `DONE` and `DISABLED`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

This change ensures that the status comparison is made with the string values 'DONE' and 'DISABLED', which should resolve the comparison issue and eliminate the bug.
