The test case 'test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses' checks that tasks with statuses 'PENDING', 'FAILED', and 'RUNNING' are nurtured by the scheduler, while tasks with statuses 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED' are not nurtured. The error message indicates that the task with status 'UNKNOWN' is not being nurtured as expected by the test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'get_necessary_tasks' method. Specifically, the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` is likely causing the issue. This condition is meant to identify tasks that are not in 'DONE' or 'DISABLED' status, but it also includes tasks with 'UNKNOWN' status, which explains the failure in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect application of the condition for identifying necessary tasks. The current condition does not exclude tasks with 'UNKNOWN' status, which is causing the test failure.

To fix the bug, the condition in the 'get_necessary_tasks' method should be updated to correctly exclude tasks with 'UNKNOWN' status. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to exclude the 'UNKNOWN' status specifically.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_necessary_tasks' method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
