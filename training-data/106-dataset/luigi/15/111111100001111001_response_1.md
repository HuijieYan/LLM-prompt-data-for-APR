The potential error in the buggy function is in the line `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` where `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined anywhere in the provided code.

The absence of `DONE` and `DISABLED` might be causing the condition to evaluate incorrectly, leading to inaccuracies in updating `necessary_tasks`.

To fix this bug, we can define `DONE` and `DISABLED` as required values and then update the condition to make it work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        DONE = 'DONE'  # Define and assign appropriate values to DONE and DISABLED
        DISABLED = 'DISABLED'
        
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
                
        return necessary_tasks
```
