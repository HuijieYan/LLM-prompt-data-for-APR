The bug in the given function is in the line: 

```
if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
```

The issue is that the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined and should be replaced with strings 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' respectively.

The original developer likely intended to check if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED' and the scheduler_disable_time attribute is not None. However, due to the use of undefined variables, this condition is not working as intended.

To fix this issue, the correct code should be:
```
if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
```

With this change, the conditional statement will work correctly, and the function should return the expected necessary_tasks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
