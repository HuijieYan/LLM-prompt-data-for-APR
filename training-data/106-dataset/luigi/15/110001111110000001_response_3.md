The error message is indicating that the set comparison between an empty set and the set returned by `self.sch.task_list(status, '')` failed because the second set contains the item 'unknown' which is not present in the first set.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that determines which statuses should be included in the set returned by `self.sch.task_list(status, '')`.

The bug is occurring because the function `get_necessary_tasks(self)` is not correctly filtering out the statuses 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED' as required by the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to revise the logic in the `get_necessary_tasks(self)` function to properly exclude the 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED' statuses.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
