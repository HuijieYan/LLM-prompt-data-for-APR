Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the get_necessary_tasks function, where the condition for checking the task status is incorrect.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be caused by the incorrect condition used to check the task status, as well as the improper handling of task dependencies.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition for checking the task status by using the correct attribute or method to access the task status.
2. Properly handle task dependencies by iterating over the task dependencies and adding them to the set of necessary tasks.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (TaskStatus.DONE, TaskStatus.DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            for dep in task.deps:
                necessary_tasks.update(dep)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
