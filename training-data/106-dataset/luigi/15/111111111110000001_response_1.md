The issue seems to be related to the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The error message indicates that the `sch.task_list` call returns 'unknown' task status instead of an empty set for the `not_nurtured_statuses` list.

The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` function appears to be with the condition for checking if a task status belongs to the `not_nurtured_statuses` list and should not be added to the `necessary_tasks` set.

The reason behind the bug is that there is no handling in the `get_necessary_tasks` function for tasks with status 'UNKNOWN'. The code assumes that these tasks will not be added to the `necessary_tasks` set, but the actual behavior is different.

To fix the bug, the code should explicitly handle the 'UNKNOWN' status and not add tasks with this status to the `necessary_tasks` set.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    
    # define the statuses that should not be nurtured
    not_nurtured_statuses = ('DONE', 'UNKNOWN', 'DISABLED')
    
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in not_nurtured_statuses or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
            
    return necessary_tasks
```
In the corrected code, the 'UNKNOWN' status is explicitly included in the `not_nurtured_statuses` tuple. This ensures that tasks with the 'UNKNOWN' status will not be added to the `necessary_tasks` set, fixing the bug.
