1. The test case is checking whether certain statuses are nurtured or not by the assistant workers. It sets up tasks with different statuses and then checks if these tasks are nurtured or not by the assistant workers.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` in the `get_necessary_tasks` function.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is checking for the existence of task statuses in uppercase, but the test case seems to be using lowercase statuses, which may be causing the assertion error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the condition to check for lowercase statuses, or
   - Modifying the test case to use uppercase statuses for comparison.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.lower() not in ('done', 'disabled') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
