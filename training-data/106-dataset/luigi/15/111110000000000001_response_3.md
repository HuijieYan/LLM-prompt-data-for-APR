The potential error in the provided function get_necessary_tasks is due to the use of 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' without being defined. Additionally, the function is trying to access the 'status' attribute of the task without it being defined in the loop. This will result in a NameError because 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' are not defined and AttributeError because 'status' is not defined for the task.

To fix this bug, the 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' status should be defined or passed as arguments to the function. Additionally, the task's status attribute should be accessed using task.status.

Here's the corrected code for the get_necessary_tasks function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def get_necessary_tasks(self, done_status, disabled_status):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (done_status, disabled_status) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
    
```

In this corrected code, the 'done_status' and 'disabled_status' are passed as arguments to the function to compare with the task status. This allows for flexibility in defining different status types depending on the requirements.
