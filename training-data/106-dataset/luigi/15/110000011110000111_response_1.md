The test case is checking whether certain task statuses are nurtured or not nurtured by an assistant worker. The error message indicates an assertion error because the set of nurtured statuses is not empty as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:`. This condition is used to determine which tasks are necessary, but it seems that the logic is not correctly handling the DONE and DISABLED statuses.

The bug is occurring because the condition is using `or` which means that if either part of the condition is true, the whole condition becomes true. This means that when a task status is DONE or DISABLED, the condition is true regardless of the second part or the scheduler_disable_time.

To fix this bug, we need to change the `or` to `and` in the condition so that both parts are required to be true for the condition to be true.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if (task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)) and \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
