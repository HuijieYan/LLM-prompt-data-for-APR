The issue is likely within the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The code seems to be incorrectly identifying the necessary tasks based on their status, and it improperly updates the necessary tasks set.

The error message indicates that the set comparison fails, specifically with the 'unknown' status. This could be due to incorrect identification of necessary tasks or incorrect handling of task statuses.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the necessary tasks based on their status and update the necessary tasks set accordingly. Additionally, the function should handle task statuses properly to ensure that the set comparison in the test case passes.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code, the `get_necessary_tasks` function should now correctly identify and update the necessary tasks based on their status. This should address the issue reported in the test case.
