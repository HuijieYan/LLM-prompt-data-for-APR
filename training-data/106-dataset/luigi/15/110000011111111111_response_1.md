The bug in the function get_necessary_tasks is likely related to the logic inside the for loop. The if condition checks for the task status not being 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', and also checks for the existence of 'scheduler_disable_time'. However, the condition might not be handling the task.status properly, leading to incorrect results when updating necessary_tasks.

The test case 'test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses' expects an empty set for the 'unknown' status, but the buggy function is adding 'unknown' to the necessary_tasks set.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the task.status condition is correctly handled and that the 'unknown' status is not added to necessary_tasks.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status in ('PENDING', 'FAILED', 'RUNNING'):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected function, we are including only the statuses 'PENDING', 'FAILED', and 'RUNNING' in the necessary_tasks set, which aligns with the expectations from the test case.
