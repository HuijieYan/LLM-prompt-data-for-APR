The test case `test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses` sets up the `CentralPlannerScheduler` and adds tasks with different statuses. It then checks if the scheduler correctly maintains the statuses of these tasks. The error message indicates that the scheduler is maintaining the status `'unknown'` when it should not be doing so according to the test case.

The potential error location is likely in the `get_necessary_tasks` function of the `SimpleTaskState` class. This function iterates over active tasks and adds their dependencies and IDs to the `necessary_tasks` set. The bug appears to be related to the conditional statement for adding tasks to `necessary_tasks`.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement does not properly check if the task status is 'DONE' or 'DISABLED'. Additionally, the comparison of task status is case-sensitive ('DONE' vs 'done'). This leads to the tasks with a status of 'UNKNOWN' being incorrectly added to `necessary_tasks`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to correctly check the status of the task with case-insensitive comparison. Additionally, a check should be added for the status 'UNKNOWN'. The corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function is as follows:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.lower() not in ('done', 'disabled') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None or task.status.lower() == 'unknown':
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
