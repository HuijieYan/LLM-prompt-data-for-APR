The buggy function `get_necessary_tasks` is intended to return a set of necessary tasks based on their status and dependencies. However, the current implementation has some issues.

Based on the provided information, the expected set of `necessary_tasks` should include the task id `'unknown'` as well as the status strings `'pending'`, `'running'`, and `'failed'`. However, the actual set returned includes the status string `'failed'` but does not include the task id `'unknown'`.

This discrepancy is likely due to the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. Since the task status can be `'UNKNOWN'` as seen in the test case, it does not meet the condition and is therefore not added to `necessary_tasks`.

To fix this issue, the condition should be updated to include `'UNKNOWN'` as a valid status for the task to be considered necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, 'UNKNOWN') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
