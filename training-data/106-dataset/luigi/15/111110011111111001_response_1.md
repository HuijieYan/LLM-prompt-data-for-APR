The error message indicates that the test case is failing because it expected an empty set for the 'unknown' status, but it received a non-empty set with the item 'unknown'. This suggests that the function `get_necessary_tasks` is not handling the 'unknown' status correctly.

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. Here, `DONE` and `DISABLED` are treated as variables, but they should be considered as strings representing status types.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison in the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is not being evaluated as expected, resulting in incorrect filtering of the 'unknown' status.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to wrap the status types 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' in quotes to make them string literals and then update the conditional statement accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
