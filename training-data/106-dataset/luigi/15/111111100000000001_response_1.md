The potential error in the code is that the `get_necessary_tasks` function is trying to call the `get_active_tasks` method without passing the required `status` parameter, which is a parameter for the `get_active_tasks` method.

This will result in a TypeError because the `get_active_tasks` method expects a `status` parameter but it is not being provided when it is called in the `get_necessary_tasks` method.

To fix this, we need to pass the `status` parameter to the `get_active_tasks` method when it is called in the `get_necessary_tasks` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks(status=None):  # pass the required status parameter
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
