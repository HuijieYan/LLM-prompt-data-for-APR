The error message indicates that there is a problem with the assertion for the "unknown" status in the test function. It seems that the "unknown" status is not being handled correctly by the code.

The potential error location within the problematic code is the get_necessary_tasks function, where it iterates over tasks and checks their status. The issue might be related to how the status "unknown" is being handled in the if condition.

The bug occurs because the status "unknown" is not being considered in the if condition to determine necessary tasks. This causes the "unknown" status to be incorrectly categorized as not nurtured when it should be. As a result, the test case fails.

To fix the bug, the if condition in the get_necessary_tasks function should include a check for the "unknown" status. Additionally, the status "unknown" should be included in the set of nurtured statuses. This will ensure that the "unknown" status is handled correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the get_necessary_tasks function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    nurtured_statuses = ['PENDING', 'FAILED', 'RUNNING', 'UNKNOWN']  # Include "UNKNOWN" in nurtured statuses
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None or task.status == UNKNOWN:  # Include check for "UNKNOWN" status
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
