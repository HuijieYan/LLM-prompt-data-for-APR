Potential error location: The if statement is using the `DONE` and `DISABLED` variables without importing them or defining them within the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` are being used without being defined or imported in the function. This is causing a NameError when the function is executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` within the function.
2. Import the module or class where `DONE` and `DISABLED` are defined.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    DONE = "done"  # Example value, replace with the actual value
    DISABLED = "disabled"  # Example value, replace with the actual value
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
