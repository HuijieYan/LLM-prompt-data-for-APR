The bug is likely located in the `get_necessary_tasks` function within the `SimpleTaskState` class. It seems that the `task.status` check is incorrect, as it is checking for specific status strings like 'DONE' and 'DISABLED', which are not defined in the given code. Additionally, the `get_active_tasks` function is not passing the `status` parameter to filter tasks based on status.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the tasks that are eligible for retry. It is also not properly filtering the active tasks based on their status.

To fix the bug, we need to define the 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' status strings, and modify the `get_active_tasks` function to accept a `status` parameter. Additionally, we need to update the `get_necessary_tasks` function to filter tasks based on status and properly check for eligibility for retry.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    active_tasks = self.get_active_tasks(status=['pending', 'running', 'failed'])
    for task in active_tasks:
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this code, we are now properly filtering the `active_tasks` based on status, and checking for eligibility for retry based on the task's status and `scheduler_disable_time`.
