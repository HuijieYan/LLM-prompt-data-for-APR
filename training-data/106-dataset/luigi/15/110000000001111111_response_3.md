The buggy function is `get_necessary_tasks` and it seems to be part of a task scheduling system. The function is supposed to retrieve necessary tasks based on their status and dependencies. 

The issue seems to be with the condition inside the for loop. The condition is checking if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', or if the task has a 'scheduler_disable_time'. However, the condition is not checking for the status of the task being 'failed' which leads to the assistant workers never retrying failed tasks.

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to also include 'FAILED' status for task retry. The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'FAILED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With this change, the function will consider 'FAILED' tasks as necessary tasks for retry. This should address the issue and allow assistant workers to retry failed tasks.
