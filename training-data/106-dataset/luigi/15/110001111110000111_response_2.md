The error message shows that the test is expecting the 'unknown' status to be an empty set, but it is not. This indicates that the 'unknown' status is not being treated correctly in the get_necessary_tasks function.

The potential error location is around the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:` in the get_necessary_tasks function.

The bug occurs because the 'unknown' status is not being handled correctly in the condition, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to include the 'unknown' status and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

By adding the 'UNKNOWN' status to the condition, the function should now handle all task statuses correctly and return the expected results in the test case.
