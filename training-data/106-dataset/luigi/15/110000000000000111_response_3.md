Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the logic of the get_necessary_tasks method. It seems to be incorrectly checking for the status of the task and the existence of scheduler_disable_time.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the condition for checking the status of the task and the existence of scheduler_disable_time is not properly defined. Additionally, it seems that the logic for updating necessary_tasks with task.deps and task.id may not be accurate.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the status of the task and the existence of scheduler_disable_time using the correct attributes.
2. Review the logic for updating necessary_tasks with task.deps and task.id and ensure it captures all the necessary tasks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status != DONE and task.status != DISABLED or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
