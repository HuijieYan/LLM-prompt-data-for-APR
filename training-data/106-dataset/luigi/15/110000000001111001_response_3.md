The potential error in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is with the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` and the getattr condition. The current implementation is not checking the status correctly and is not considering the task's scheduler_disable_time properly. This is leading to an incorrect update of `necessary_tasks`.

The status condition is not properly comparing the task status with the correct values. Additionally, the condition for `scheduler_disable_time` is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to properly check the task status and the `scheduler_disable_time`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, we are checking if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED' and also checking if the `scheduler_disable_time` is not None. This should ensure that the necessary tasks are updated correctly.
