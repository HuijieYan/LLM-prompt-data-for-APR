Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the `get_necessary_tasks` method that is not correctly identifying the necessary tasks that need to be retried.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the function is not properly checking for failed tasks that are eligible for retry. It is also not properly handling the status of tasks and their dependencies.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the correct status of the tasks, including failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
2. Properly handle the dependencies of the tasks.
3. Add logic to ensure that necessary tasks for retry are correctly identified and included in the set of necessary tasks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status in (FAILED, DISABLED) or \
                (getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None and task.status == FAILED):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, we have added the handling for failed tasks that are eligible for retry and properly checking their status and dependencies. This should address the issue of assistant workers not retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
