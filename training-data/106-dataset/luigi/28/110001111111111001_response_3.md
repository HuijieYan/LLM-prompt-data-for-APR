The test cases are related to the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.

The error message states "AssertionError: False is not true". This means that the function is returning False when it should have returned True. This indicates a logical error in the function's implementation.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` method is in the condition where it checks for the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the different cases of table existence and partition specification correctly, resulting in incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to handle both cases where the output of `run_hive_cmd` contains the table name and when it doesn't.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
# corrected `table_exists` method
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return "OK" in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        
        return any(partition_str in p for p in partitions.splitlines())
```

In this corrected code:
- For the case where partition is None, we check if "OK" is in the output lines of the `run_hive_cmd`.
- For the case where partition is specified, we fetch the list of partitions and check if the specified partition exists in the list.

This fixed implementation should handle the different cases of table existence and partition specification correctly and resolve the logical errors in the original implementation.
