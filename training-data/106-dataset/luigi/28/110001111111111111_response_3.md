The error occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks if a table exists in the database, but it does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The code does not account for the case sensitivity of the table names when checking the stdout. Therefore, when the table names are in different cases, the comparison fails.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lower case for comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to make the check case insensitive.

This fix should address the issues reported in the test cases and the associated GitHub issues.
