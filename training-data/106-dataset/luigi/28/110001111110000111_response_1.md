The error in the provided code is likely responsible for the failing test case. The `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, causing the assertion error in the test case when comparing table names.

The provided code shows that the `table_exists` function checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner, which causes issues when comparing table names with different cases.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.

The corrected code for the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function will compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, which should resolve the failing test case and address the bug.
