The error message indicates that the test is failing because the `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check where it compares the table name with the stdout from the hive command. It looks like the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to the test failures.

The reason behind the bug is that the `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the stdout from the hive command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, we use the `lower()` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive.
