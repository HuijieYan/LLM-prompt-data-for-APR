The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, but the table names are case insensitive in Hive, which can lead to false negatives.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the function now converts both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that case insensitivity is taken into account when checking for the existence of a table.
