The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function in the `hive.py` file. The issue arises because the function performs a case-sensitive check for table existence, which can lead to failures when the table names are not in the exact case as expected.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be updated to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With this change, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for the table existence and return the correct result. This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub issue where table names were not being matched correctly due to case sensitivity.
