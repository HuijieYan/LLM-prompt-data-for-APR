The error in the test case is due to the `table_exists` function returning False instead of True for the case-insensitive table check.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the comparison of the table name in the stdout with the provided table name. It looks for an exact match, so it is case-sensitive.

The bug occurs because the table name comparison is case-sensitive, but the test case expects it to be case-insensitive. Therefore, when the test case checks for the existence of a table with a different case, it fails.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the table name with the names in the stdout should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both table names to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison is made, making it case-insensitive.
