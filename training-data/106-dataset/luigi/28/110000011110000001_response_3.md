The error message indicates that the test case `test_table_exists` is failing because it expects `returned = self.client.table_exists("MyTable")` to return `True` but it returns `False` instead.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it can be identified that the issue lies in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The logic for checking the existence of a table and its partitions seems to be incorrect, leading to the failing test case.

The issue occurs because when checking for the existence of a table with a different case (like 'MyTable' instead of 'mytable'), the method does not handle case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should be modified to make the comparison of table names case insensitive. For the given method, a potential fix is to convert both the table names to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification will ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner in the `table_exists` method.
