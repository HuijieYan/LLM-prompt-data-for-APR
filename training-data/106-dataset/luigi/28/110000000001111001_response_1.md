The potential error in the provided function is the inconsistency in the return values for the different conditions. In the if-else block, the first condition returns the result of `table in stdout` while the second condition returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout`.

The bug is occurring due to the inconsistency in the return values based on the conditions. This inconsistency is likely to cause issues when using the function in different contexts, such as in conditional statements.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the return values are consistent. We can modify the function to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not. Also, we can use the `run_hive_cmd` method directly in the else block to check if the partition exists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

In the corrected code, the function always returns `True` or `False` based on the conditions, ensuring consistency in the return values. Additionally, the `run_hive_cmd` method is used directly in the else block to check if the partition exists.
