The error occurs because the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function checks for an exact match, which leads to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match what is returned by Hive.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and (table.lower() in stdout.lower())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, the `table.lower()` method is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive, which is also converted to lowercase using `stdout.lower()`. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and should resolve the test failures.

Additionally, it's advisable to include a test case specifically for table_exists to cover different scenarios for table names and their case sensitivity.
