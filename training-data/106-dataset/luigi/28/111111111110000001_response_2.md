The error message indicates that the `test_table_exists` function is failing because it is expecting a `True` return value, but getting `False` instead.

Upon analyzing the code, we can see that the issue lies in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The problem is in the condition where it checks for the presence of a partition. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect arguments, leading to incorrect return values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with incorrect arguments when checking for the existence of a partition. This causes the function to return unexpected values, leading to the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the correct arguments when checking for the existence of a partition. Additionally, the condition for checking the return value of `run_hive_cmd` needs to be handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other functions ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected code, we've updated the `table_exists` function to correctly build the partition string and call the `run_hive_cmd` function with the right arguments. The condition to check if `stdout` has any value has also been updated to return `True` if the partition exists and `False` if it doesn't.
