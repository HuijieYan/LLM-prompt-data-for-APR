The error message from the test case indicates that the function `table_exists` is not handling the case insensitivity correctly. The `test_table_exists` function is failing when testing for a table that is capitalized, as the function is case sensitive.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name. It currently checks if the table is in the stdout without considering case insensitivity.

The bug occurs because the function does not consider case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case insensitivity and the test cases should pass without any issues.
