The issue in the `table_exists` method seems to be with the logic to check if the table exists in the database and handle partitions. The function fails to properly handle the input parameters and adjust the logic based on the presence of a partition.

The first step to fix the bug is to ensure that the input parameters are correctly handled, and the conditional logic for handling partitions is implemented properly. Additionally, the function should account for case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

One potential approach to fix the bug is to modify the `table_exists` method to handle both cases where a partition is provided and where it is not provided. Additionally, the method should also handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_exists_query = 'use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table)
    if partition:
        partition_exists_query = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table,
                                                                                          self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(partition_exists_query)
        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(table_exists_query)
        return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```
