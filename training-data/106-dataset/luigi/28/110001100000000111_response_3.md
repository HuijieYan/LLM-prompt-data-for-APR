The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may be in a different case.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the Hive output needs to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else statement here
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the bug described in the issue.
