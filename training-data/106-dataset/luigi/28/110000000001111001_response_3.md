The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table or partition exists in a Hive database. The function has two conditional branches based on whether a partition is provided or not.

The potential issues in the current function are:
1. The use of `run_hive_cmd` is not defined within the function. It seems to be a separate utility function or method that is not provided in the given code snippet.

2. In the else branch, the call to `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not defined within the function. It seems to be a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class but is not included in the given code snippet.

To fix the function:
1. Define the `run_hive_cmd` utility function or method that interacts with Hive to execute the required commands. If it is an external utility, import it into the file containing the `table_exists` function.

2. Include the method `self.partition_spec(partition)` within the class `HiveCommandClient` or provide the implementation for this method if it's supposed to be a part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.

3. Use proper error handling to manage potential exceptions during the execution of Hive commands.

4. After addressing the issues, the corrected code for the `table_exists` method can be as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        try:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            return False
```
In the corrected code, error handling is added, assuming the use of a `run_hive_cmd` utility function and the `self.partition_spec` method within the `HiveCommandClient` class. If these are not defined as described, they need to be provided or implemented accordingly.
