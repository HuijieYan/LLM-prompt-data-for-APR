The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` is testing the `get_work` function with an assistant worker, to check if it returns `None` task ID when there is no work available for the worker 'Y'.

The potential error in the `get_work` function seems to be in the logic for finding the best task to assign to the worker. The function is trying to find the best task by iterating through all the tasks and checking their status and resource availability. However, there are some issues in this logic causing it to not correctly identify the best task for the worker.

One approach to fixing this bug is to review the logic for finding the best task, ensuring that it correctly checks the status of the task, the worker's availability, and the task's resource availability.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
import time
import collections
import itertools
import six

def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = dict((worker.id, worker.info.get('workers', 1))
                          for worker in self._state.get_active_workers())

    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=lambda task: self._rank(task), reverse=True)

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            # Return a list of currently running tasks to the client,
            # makes it easier to troubleshoot
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and task.worker_running in greedy_workers:
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount

        # Check if the task is schedulable and has enough resources
        if self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources) and in_workers:
            best_task = task
            break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
