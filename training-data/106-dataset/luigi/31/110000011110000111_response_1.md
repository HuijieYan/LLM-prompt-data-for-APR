The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` calls the `get_work` method with `assistant=True` expecting the return value to have a `'task_id'` attribute that is `None`. However, the test fails with the error message `AssertionError: False is not true`.

The potential error location within the `get_work` method is at the line where the `reply` dictionary is constructed and returned. The `reply` dictionary is expected to contain a `'task_id'` attribute, but it is not guaranteed to have one if no suitable task is found.

The bug occurs because the `reply` dictionary is constructed assuming that it will always contain a `'task_id'` attribute, but this is not the case if no suitable task is found.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `get_work` method to ensure that the `reply` dictionary only contains a `'task_id'` attribute if a suitable task is found. This can be achieved by conditionally constructing the `reply` dictionary based on whether a suitable task has been found.

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (same code as before)

    # rest of the code remains the same

    # ... (same code as before)

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply = {'task_id': best_task.id, 'task_family': best_task.family, 'task_module': getattr(best_task, 'module', None), 'task_params': best_task.params}
    else:
        reply = {'task_id': None}

    return reply
```

In the corrected function, we construct the `reply` dictionary containing `'task_id'` and other task-related attributes only if `best_task` is found. Otherwise, we construct a `reply` dictionary with only the `'task_id'` attribute set to `None`. This ensures that the `reply` dictionary always contains a `'task_id'` attribute, as expected by the calling test case.
