The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` is calling the `get_work` function of the `self.sch` object with the parameters `'Y'` and `assistant=True`, and then checking if the returned value for the key `'task_id'` is `None`. The assertion fails, indicating that the returned value is not `None`, which is expected.

The potential error in the `get_work` function is that the condition to check if `best_task` exists and is a schedulable task with sufficient resources is not being properly evaluated. This could be the reason behind the failed assertion in the test case.

To fix the bug, the condition to check for `best_task` and its schedulability with sufficient resources needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, any other logical issues within the function should be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status == PENDING and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == RUNNING and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount

        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources) and in_workers:
            best_task = task

    if best_task:
        # ... (previous code) ...
        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    # ... (previous code) ...

    return reply
``` 

In the corrected code, the check for `best_task` and its schedulability with sufficient resources has been modified to ensure it meets the desired conditions. Additionally, the logic for updating the `reply` dictionary has been retained.
