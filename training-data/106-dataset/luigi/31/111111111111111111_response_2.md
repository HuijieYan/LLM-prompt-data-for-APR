The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` expects that `self.sch.get_work('Y', assistant=True)['task_id']` should be `None`. However, the test fails with the error message "AssertionError: False is not true."

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for identifying the best task that can be assigned to the worker. The function is not properly handling the assignment of the best task to the worker, which leads to incorrect results and the test failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for identifying the best task may not be correctly determining the task that can be assigned to the worker due to incorrect handling of various task statuses during the iteration process.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly identify the best task that can be assigned to the worker based on the available resources, task status, and other relevant factors.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank(), reverse=True)

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            running_tasks.append(task)

        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount

        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        # use up a worker
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1

                        # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                        for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                            greedy_resources[resource] += amount

                        break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```  
Note: In the corrected code, the status comparison for tasks has been updated to use string literals instead of variables or constants that are not defined in the provided code snippet. Additionally, the logic for updating the best task and building the response has been improved to ensure correct functionality.
