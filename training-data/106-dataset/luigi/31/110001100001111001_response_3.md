The buggy function `get_work` has several issues:
1. The function is accessing instance variables without referencing them through `self.` which might lead to missing references.
2. The variable `PENDING` is used without being defined in the given code, which might result in a NameError.
3. The `rank` method is called incorrectly. It should be passed as a key function to the `sort` method.

To fix the issues, the corrected code for the function `get_work` is provided below:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = dict((worker.id, worker.info.get('workers', 1))
                          for worker in self._state.get_active_workers())
    
    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)  # Pass the method reference without parentheses

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:  # Check for status as string
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:  # Check for status as string
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in (task.resources or {}).items():  # Use .items() to iterate over dictionary
                self._add_to_dict(greedy_resources, resource, amount)

        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        # use up a worker
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1
                        for resource, amount in (task.resources or {}).items():
                            self._add_to_dict(greedy_resources, resource, amount)
                        break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)  # Check for status as string
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)  # Check for status as string

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

I assume that some missing methods such as `_add_to_dict`, which adds keys to a dictionary and improves readability, are implemented somewhere in the codebase. If such a method doesn't exist, it can be defined as follows:

```python
def _add_to_dict(d, key, value):
    if key in d:
        d[key] += value
    else:
        d[key] = value
```
