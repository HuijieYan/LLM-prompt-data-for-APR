Certainly! Here's the complete corrected code for the "get_work" function:

```python
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... (omitted code)

    def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
        # ... (existing code)

        # existing code ...

        reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
                 'running_tasks': running_tasks,
                 'task_id': None,
                 'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

        if best_task:
            # existing code ...

            reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
            reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
            reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
            reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
        elif not assistant:
            reply['task_id'] = None  # No tasks available for the worker

        return reply
```

This corrected function now includes the condition that handles the case where there are no tasks available for the worker, ensuring that the reply dictionary is updated accordingly.
