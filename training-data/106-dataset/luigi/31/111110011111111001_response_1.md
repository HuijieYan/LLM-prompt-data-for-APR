The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` is calling the `get_work` function with the worker id 'Y' and the `assistant` flag set to True. It then asserts that the returned value for the 'task_id' key should be None, but the assertion fails. 

Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `get_work` function. It is not handling the case where the task should have been returned as None when the 'assistant' flag is set to True.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'assistant' flag is being used inside the `get_work` function to add a worker to the scheduler. This might be causing the issue as the logic to handle this case and return the task_id as None is missing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling the `assistant` flag in the `get_work` function and make sure it is correctly implemented to return None when appropriate.
2. Ensure that the 'assistant' flag is correctly being processed to determine the task assignment and that it doesn't interfere with the task retrieval logic.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # existing logic

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}
    
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)
    
        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
    else:
        if assistant:
            reply['task_id'] = None  # No task available for the assistant worker
        
    return reply
```
In the corrected code above, an additional condition is included to explicitly set the `task_id` to None when the 'assistant' flag is True and no task is available for the assistant worker. This should address the issue identified in the test case.
