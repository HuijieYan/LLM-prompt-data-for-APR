The test function test_assistant_get_work_external_task is calling the get_work method on the self.sch object with the assistant parameter set to True. The test is then checking if the returned task_id is None using the assertTrue function.

The potential error location in the get_work method is not handling the case when there are no pending tasks for the worker and assistant.

The bug occurs because when there are no pending tasks for the worker and assistant, the get_work method should return None for the task_id. However, it seems that the method is not handling this case properly, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check in the get_work method to return None for the task_id when there are no pending tasks for the worker and assistant.

Here's the corrected code for the get_work method:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # existing code...

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    if not best_task:  # Add this block to handle the case when there are no pending tasks for the worker and assistant
        return None

    return reply
```

With this updated code, the get_work method will now return None for the task_id if there are no pending tasks for the worker and assistant, which should fix the test case failure.
