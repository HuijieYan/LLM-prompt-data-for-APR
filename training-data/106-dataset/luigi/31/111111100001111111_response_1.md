The bug is likely occurring because the code is using the `update` method twice for different purposes. The original method `def update(self, worker_reference):` and the overridden method `def update(self, worker_id, worker_reference=None):` are defined for different purposes. This could cause confusion for the program and potential logical errors.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are the following:
- The `update` method is being used for two different purposes: one to update the worker and another to update the task history.
- The `get_work` method is trying to use the `update` method to update workers and tasks, which could lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Rename the updated method to `update_worker` or something similar to make the purpose clear, and then adjust the `get_work` method to call the appropriate method for updating the worker.
- Ensure that the `update` method is dedicated to one specific purpose to avoid confusion and potential logical errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # the existing code here...

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        # existing code here to set status, worker_running, time_running, and update task history

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

It's also recommended to avoid reusing method names with different signatures and purposes to prevent confusion and potential logical errors.
