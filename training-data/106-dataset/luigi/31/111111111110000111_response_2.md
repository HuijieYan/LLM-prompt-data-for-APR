The provided buggy function is `get_work` within the class `CentralPlannerScheduler`. The test function `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` tries to add a task with ID 'A' and then calls `get_work` with worker ID 'Y' and the `assistant=True` flag. However, the assertion `self.assertTrue(self.sch.get_work('Y', assistant=True)['task_id'] is None)` fails, indicating that the `get_work` function did not return a 'task_id' of None when it was expected to do so.

Looking at the `get_work` function, the potential error location could be the logic that checks for available tasks and assigns the 'best_task'. The conditions for assigning the 'best_task' might not be correctly evaluating the availability of tasks for the given worker and the 'assistant' flag.

The bug occurred because the logic to find the best task for the worker and assistant was not correctly evaluating all the necessary conditions. As a result, the function was not returning the correct task ID.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for assigning the 'best_task' and ensure that it correctly evaluates the availability of tasks for the given worker and assistant.
2. Check the conditions for categorizing tasks as 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING' and verify that the appropriate tasks are being considered for assignment.
3. Ensure that the resources required by the task are available and compatible with the worker's resources.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    
    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    best_task = None

    for task in tasks:
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, self._used_resources()):
            if assistant and worker not in task.workers:
                continue  # Skip tasks that are not assigned to the worker or assistant
            best_task = task
            break
    
    reply = {'task_id': None}
    
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)
        
        reply = {
            'task_id': best_task.id,
            'task_family': best_task.family,
            'task_module': getattr(best_task, 'module', None),
            'task_params': best_task.params
        }
    
    return reply
```
