The issue with the `get_work` method seems to be the incorrect task assignment inside the for loop. The error occurs because `task` is of type `Task`, and thus `task.status` should be accessed as `task.status()`. 

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the line `if task.status == PENDING and in_workers` to `if task.status() == PENDING and in_workers`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status() == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            # Return a list of currently running tasks to the client,
            # makes it easier to troubleshoot
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status() == PENDING and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status() == RUNNING and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount

        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        # use up a worker
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1

                        # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                        for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                            greedy_resources[resource] += amount

                        break

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    return reply
