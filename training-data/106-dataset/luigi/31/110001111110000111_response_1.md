Potential Error Location:
The bug may be in the `scheduler.py` file, particularly in the `get_work` method.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion `self.assertTrue(self.sch.get_work('Y', assistant=True)['task_id'] is None)` is failing, which means that the returned task_id is not None when it should be. This suggests that the `get_work` method is not functioning correctly, possibly due to issues in the logic for finding and assigning tasks.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the logic for finding the best task to assign to the worker and ensure that it properly considers the status and availability of tasks.
2. Review the resource checking in the method to confirm that it accurately determines if a task is schedulable and has the necessary resources.
3. Verify that the update of task status and assignment to a worker is carried out correctly.
4. Debug the method step by step to identify specific points where the logic may be failing.

Corrected Code for the get_work Method:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
  
    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            running_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1
    
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in task.resources.items():
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount
    
        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1
    
                        for resource, amount in task.resources.items():
                            greedy_resources[resource] += amount
    
                        break
