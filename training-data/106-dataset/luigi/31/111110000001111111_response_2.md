The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic for selecting the best task to assign to the worker. It appears that the selection logic is not correctly identifying the tasks that are eligible to be assigned to the worker.

Additionally, the logic for updating the running and pending task counts as well as the resources is not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, I would suggest the following:
1. Change the logic for selecting the best task. Verify and correct any conditional statements that are incorrectly filtering tasks or misidentifying the worker's eligibility for certain tasks.
2. Update the logic for tracking the counts of pending tasks, running tasks, and resource usage.
3. Update the logic for updating the task status and assigning it to the worker.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    
    best_task = None
    pending_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    for task in pending_tasks:
        if self._schedulable(task):
            best_task = task
            break

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)
    
    n_pending_tasks = sum(1 for task in pending_tasks if task.status == 'PENDING')
    running_tasks = [task for task in self._state.get_active_tasks() if task.status == 'RUNNING']
    
    reply = {
        'n_pending_tasks': n_pending_tasks,
        'running_tasks': running_tasks,
        'task_id': best_task.id if best_task else None,
        'n_unique_pending': sum(1 for task in pending_tasks if task.status == 'PENDING' and len(task.workers) == 1)
    }

    if best_task:
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```
