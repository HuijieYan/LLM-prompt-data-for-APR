1. The test case is calling the `get_work` function on the `self.sch` object (which presumably is an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler`), passing 'Y' as the worker and setting the `assistant` flag to True. The test then checks if the returned result has a 'task_id' field which is None, and this assertion fails.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic of identifying the best task to assign to the worker. Specifically, it seems like the logic for finding the best task based on its status, worker's capacity, and resource availability might be flawed.

3. The error is occurring because the `get_work` method is not returning the expected result. This indicates that the logic within the `get_work` method is not properly identifying the best task to assign to the worker.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
    a. Review and revise the logic for identifying the best task to ensure that it properly accounts for the status, worker's capacity, and resource availability.
    b. Check if the functions used within the `get_work` method, such as `_used_resources`, `_rank`, `_schedulable`, and `_has_resources`, are functioning correctly and are returning the expected results.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `get_work`:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # Corrected logic for finding the best task
    self.update(worker)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)

    for task in self._state.get_pending_tasks():
        if task.status == PENDING and worker in task.workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == RUNNING and worker in task.workers:
            # Return a list of currently running tasks to the client,
            # makes it easier to troubleshoot
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
            best_task = task
            break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
