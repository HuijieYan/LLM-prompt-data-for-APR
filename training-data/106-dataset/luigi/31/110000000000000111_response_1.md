Potential error location: 
The error may occur in the section where the function is iterating through the list of tasks and checking their status and resources.

Reason behind the bug:
1. The code is not handling the cases where the task status is "PENDING" and the worker is an assistant, leading to incorrect task allocation.
2. The code is not properly updating the task status and worker information after assigning a task to a worker.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to properly handle the "PENDING" tasks when the worker is an assistant.
2. Update the task status and worker information after assigning a task.

Corrected code:

```python
import time
import collections
import itertools
import six

def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
