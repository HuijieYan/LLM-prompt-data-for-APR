The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the 'columns' attribute is of type None and the code is trying to get the length of a None type object. This is happening in the copy function where it is checking the length of self.columns.

The potential error location is identified in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to check the length of a None type object, which is not allowed and resulting in a TypeError.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the code will first check if self.columns is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError.
