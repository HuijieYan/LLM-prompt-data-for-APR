The error occurs when the `copy` method is called with `columns` set to `None`. This causes an error when the method tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

The potential error location is within the `copy` method where the length of `self.columns` is being checked without verifying if it is None or not.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None`. When `self.columns` is None, trying to check its length causes a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length. If `self.columns` is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before calculating its length. If `self.columns` is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string, avoiding the TypeError that was occurring before.
