Potential error location:
The issue is likely coming from the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. This line assumes that `self.columns` is not None, leading to a `TypeError` if it is. 

Reason behind the bug:
The error occurs because `self.columns` is checked for its length without verifying if it's `None` or not. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `len` function cannot be applied to it, leading to a `TypeError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before applying the `len` function.
2. Use the truthiness of `self.columns` to determine if it has any elements, instead of checking its length.

Code for the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations.
- The `copy_options` method is called correctly using `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` statement.
