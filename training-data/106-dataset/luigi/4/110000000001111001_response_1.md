The potential error location within the provided function is in the cursor.execute() block, particularly in the format() method. The error is likely due to missing placeholders for the credentials and options in the format string.

The bug occurred because the placeholders for credentials and options were not included in the format() method, which caused the string formatting to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to include the placeholders for credentials and options in the format string and provide the actual values for these placeholders when calling the format() method.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the placeholders {creds} and {options} have been included in the format string, and the actual values for these placeholders will be provided when calling the format() method.
