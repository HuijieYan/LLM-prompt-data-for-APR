Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the line where the length of self.columns is checked. If self.columns is None, the code will throw a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where self.columns is None. It assumes that self.columns will always have a value, leading to the TypeError when it is actually None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by checking if self.columns is not None before trying to get its length. If it is None, we can set colnames to an empty string.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
