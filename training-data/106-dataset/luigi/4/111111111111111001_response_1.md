The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `self.columns` which is of type 'NoneType'.

The issue is that when `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is instantiated with `columns=None`, the code in the `copy` method does not handle this case appropriately and assumes that `self.columns` is a list.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to see if `columns` is not `None`, and only then proceed with processing `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added an additional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length and process its elements. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring.
