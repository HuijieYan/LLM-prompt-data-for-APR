The error occurs in the buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable`. The error is due to the fact that the function is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` when the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is created in the test function.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to extract the column names from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to extract the column names.

With these changes, the `TypeError` caused by `self.columns` being `None` should be resolved.
