Error location: The error is in the `cursor.execute` method call within the `copy` function. Specifically, the `options` parameter is not being called as a function.

Reason for the bug: The `copy_options` method is intended to return a string of copy options, but it is not being called as a function in the `cursor.execute` method.

Possible approaches to fix the bug: Call the `copy_options` method as a function to get the options string, and also fix the placeholders in the format string.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
