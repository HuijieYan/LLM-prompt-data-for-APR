The error seems to be occurring when the `len` function is called on `self.columns`, which is likely None when no columns are provided.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change ensures that if `self.columns` is None, the `len` function will not be called on it, avoiding the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
