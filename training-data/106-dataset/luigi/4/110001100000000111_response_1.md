The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not check if the `self.columns` attribute is None before trying to get its length. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
1. Adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Providing a default value for `self.columns` if it's not provided when calling the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
