The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement that checks the length of the self.columns list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when columns are not provided (i.e., self.columns is None), the buggy code does not handle this case properly and tries to get the length of a NoneType, which results in the TypeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to explicitly check if self.columns is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
