The error in the test case occurs because the `task_list` method is returning the status of the task as 'DISABLED' instead of 'FAILED' after the `add_task` method is called to add the task with status 'FAILED'. This suggests that there is an issue with the `set_status` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class, which is not updating the status of the task correctly.

The potential error location within the `set_status` method is in the block of code for handling the status change to FAILED and DISABLED. It seems that the logic for updating the status and handling the re-enable after a certain period is incorrect, leading to the incorrect status being set.

The bug occurs because the conditions for handling the status change to FAILED and DISABLED are not properly implemented. Additionally, the logic for re-enabling the task after a certain period is also not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to properly handle the status change to FAILED and DISABLED, as well as correctly implement the re-enable logic after a certain period.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    elif new_status == DONE:
        # Reset failure count if task status changes to DONE
        task.reset_failures()

    if task.status != new_status:
        del self._status_tasks[task.status][task.id]
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
1. I added a condition to reset the failure count when the task status changes to DONE.
2. Refactored the status update logic to eliminate redundant checks and correctly update the task's status.
