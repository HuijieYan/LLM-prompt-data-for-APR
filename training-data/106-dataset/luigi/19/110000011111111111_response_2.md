The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` creates an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures=1` and `disable_persist=100`. Then it sets the time to 0 and adds a task with id='A' and status=FAILED. After setting the time to 101, it expects the status of task 'A' to be FAILED, but it is DISABLED.

The potential error location within the function is the block of code where the new status is being set to DISABLED. This happens when the task has excessive failures and it is supposed to be disabled for a specified period.

The bug occurs because when the new status is set to DISABLED due to excessive failures, the function does not reset it back to FAILED after the disable period is over.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic that handles the transition from FAILED to DISABLED and vice versa. After the disable period is over, the status should be restored to FAILED.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            if task.scheduler_disable_time <= time.time():  # Check if disable period is over
                new_status = FAILED  # Restore status back to FAILED
            else:
                return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the disable period
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this corrected logic, the status of the task will be restored to FAILED after the disable period is over, as expected in the test case.
