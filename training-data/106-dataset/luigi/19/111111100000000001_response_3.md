The potential error in the `set_status` function is that the code is trying to access variables such as `FAILED`, `DISABLED`, `RUNNING`, `DONE` etc. without them being defined anywhere in the code. It seems like these are supposed to be constants, but they are not defined in the provided code.

To fix this issue, we need to define these constants and use them properly in the `set_status` function to compare the `new_status` and `task.status` with the proper constants.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... other code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        FAILED = "FAILED"
        DISABLED = "DISABLED"
        RUNNING = "RUNNING"
        DONE = "DONE"

        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            self.add_failure(task)
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
``` 

In this corrected code, I have defined the constants `FAILED`, `DISABLED`, `RUNNING`, and `DONE` and used them properly in the `set_status` function to compare `new_status` and `task.status`. I have also changed `task.add_failure()` to `self.add_failure(task)` since `add_failure` is a method of the same class. Additionally, I have removed the `pass` statement from the `re_enable` method to make it a valid method.
