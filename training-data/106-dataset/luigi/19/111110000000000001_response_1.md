The potential error in the given code is that the condition `if new_status == FAILED:` does not check if the `new_status` is a part of the defined `FAILED` enum. Additionally, the `DISABLED` and `RUNNING` constants are not defined in the code, which will cause errors.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle the enum values properly, and it also references constants that are not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to import the enum values and use them in the conditions. Additionally, we should handle the enum values defined in the `task` object properly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Status(Enum):
    FAILED = 'failed'
    DISABLED = 'disabled'
    RUNNING = 'running'
    DONE = 'done'

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
