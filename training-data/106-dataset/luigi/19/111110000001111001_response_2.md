The issue in the given function `set_status` seems to be related to the handling of `FAILED` status for a task. The code contains conditionals for when the new status is `FAILED`, but it doesn't handle the other cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because when the new status is `FAILED`, it checks for a specific condition and modifies the task accordingly. However, when the new status is not `FAILED`, there is no explicit handling, creating an inconsistency in the task status and the `self._status_tasks` data structure.

To fix the bug, a proper handling for each status transition is required. This involves checking for the new status and then updating the task and `self._status_tasks` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            # Additional logic specific to DONE status
        elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Update the scheduler_disable_time to current time

    self._update_status_tasks(task, new_status)
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
1. I added explicit checks for the transition between each status.
2. Modified the `task.scheduler_disable_time` for new `DISABLED` status.
3. Extracted the status update logic to a separate method `_update_status_tasks` for better readability and maintainability.
