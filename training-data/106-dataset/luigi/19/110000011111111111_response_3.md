The problem occurs at the end of the `set_status` function, where the status update for the task is not in sync with the intended logic based on the inputs.

The bug occurs because the functionality to update the status of the task after elapsed time is not working as intended. When the time exceeds the disable_persist time, the status of the task should change from DISABLED to FAILED. However, the current implementation does not reflect this.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the status of the task after elapsed time needs to be modified. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == "FAILED":
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == "DISABLED" and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)

        # update status after elapsed time
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time > config.disable_persist:
            new_status = "FAILED"
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task}',
                f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
            )
        
            task.status = new_status
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
            self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This corrected function updates the status of the task based on the elapsed time and the configuration parameters provided. By including the logic for updating the status after elapsed time, the function now behaves as intended, and the test case should pass without any errors.
