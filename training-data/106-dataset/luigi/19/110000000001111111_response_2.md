The potential error is the condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():`. This condition is causing unintended behavior depending on the status of the task.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the task status transitions is not properly implemented within the function. When new_status is set to FAILED, it checks if the task can be disabled, and if so, it increments the failure count and potentially disables the task. In the meantime, the status of the task should be updated to the new status.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the task status based on the new_status should be restructured. The status should be updated after all the conditions have been evaluated and handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    task.status = new_status  # Update the task status here
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
```
