The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `if new_status == FAILED:` block where it checks for `config is not None`, and in the `elif new_status == DONE:` block where it calls `self.re_enable(task)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` statuses correctly. Additionally, the use of `config` and the `re_enable` method seems to be incorrect.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly check for the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` statuses and handle them accordingly. Also, ensure that the `re_enable` method is called with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        if config is None:
            raise ValueError("config is required for FAILED status")
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return
    
    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task, config)
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable():
        self.add_failure(task)
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
