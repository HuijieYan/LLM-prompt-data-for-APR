The error message from the test function indicates that the status of task 'A' is not transitioning from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after the time has passed. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for changing the status of the task from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' when the task has excessive failures.

The bug occurs because the logic inside the 'set_status' function does not properly handle the transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' when the task has excessive failures. The function does attempt to change the status to 'DISABLED' when the task has excessive failures but it does not remove the task from the 'FAILED' status. This results in the task remaining in the 'FAILED' status even after the status is updated to 'DISABLED', causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
        new_status = DISABLED

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for transitioning the task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' has been updated to properly remove the task from the 'FAILED' status before adding it to the 'DISABLED' status. This should fix the bug and address the issue with the test case.
