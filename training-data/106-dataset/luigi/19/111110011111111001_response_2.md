The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking whether a task is re-enabled after it has been disabled due to excessive failures. The task is expected to be disabled initially and then re-enabled after 100 seconds.

The error message states that the task is still in a 'FAILED' state after the time has passed, instead of being in the 'DISABLED' state as expected.

The issue is within the `set_status` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. The logic for transitioning the task from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after excessive failures and a specific duration is not working as expected.

The bug occurs because the condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():` is not properly handling the transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED'. The code should set the `new_status` to 'DISABLED' and re-enable the task.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic where if the new status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled, we should set the new status to 'DISABLED' and perform the necessary actions for re-enabling the task. Additionally, we need to remove the condition where the task status is set to 'FAILED' as it contradicts the logic of transitioning to 'DISABLED'.

The corrected code for the `set_status` method is as follows:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
