The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` checks whether a task is re-enabled after a certain amount of time has passed since it failed. However, the error message indicates that the task is expected to be in `DISABLED` status after a certain duration but it remains in `FAILED` status.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the logic related to handling the `FAILED` status and re-enabling the task.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for re-enabling the task after a certain duration is not correctly implemented. The function is not properly transitioning the status of the task from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` after the specified time has elapsed.

To fix the bug, the logic for transitioning the task from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` after a certain duration needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
            new_status = FAILED  # Transition to FAILED if disable time has elapsed
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
            ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the condition `elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None` is changed to `elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist`, which ensures that the task transition to `FAILED` if its disable time has elapsed. This will allow the task to be correctly re-enabled after the specified duration.
