The issue with the provided function is that if the task status is 'DISABLED' and the new status is 'DONE', the `self.re_enable(task)` method should be called instead of returning. Additionally, the method `add_failure()` should be called on the task and the `send_error_email()` method from the `notifications` module should be used to send an error email when a task has excessive failures.

To fix this, we will make the following changes:
1. Instead of returning when the task status is 'DISABLED' and the new status is 'DONE', call the `self.re_enable(task)` method.
2. If the new status is 'FAILED' and the task has excessive failures, call the `task.add_failure()` method and set the `task.scheduler_disable_time` to the current time. Also, use the `notifications.send_error_email()` method to send an error email.
3. Update the status and the related data structures after each conditional block.

Here's the corrected code for the method:

```python
import time
import notifications  # Assuming notifications is the module containing send_error_email function

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)

            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        # Update status and data structures
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With these changes, the method should now correctly handle the different statuses and update the task's status and related data structures accordingly.
