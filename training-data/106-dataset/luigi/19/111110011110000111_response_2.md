The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` instantiates a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures=1` and `disable_persist=100` and then adds a task with `status=FAILED`. It then checks if the task's status is set to DISABLED after 100 seconds. The error message indicates that the task's status is not being updated correctly.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `set_status`, it appears that the issue might be with the logic for handling the task status change based on the conditions and the `new_status`. It seems that the logic for transitioning the task status is not working as intended, resulting in the incorrect status being set.

The potential reasons behind the bug could be:
1. Incorrect conditional checks and transitions of task status.
2. Misinterpretation of the logic for handling task status changes.

To fix the bug, the logic for transitioning the task status needs to be corrected. Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
        new_status = DISABLED # Moved this inside if condition

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Corrected task status transitions
    if task.status != new_status:
        if task.status in self._status_tasks:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)

        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With the corrected code, the issue with the test case should be resolved, and the task status should transition correctly based on the conditions.
