The error message indicates that the status of task 'A' should have changed from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after 101 seconds, as specified by the test case. However, it seems that the status has not been updated properly, leading to the failed assertion.

After analyzing the code, it seems that the issue arises in the 'set_status' method of the 'SimpleTaskState' class. Specifically, when the new status is set to 'FAILED', the logic for updating the task status and handling the scheduler_disable_time might not be functioning as intended.

The bug occurs because, when the new status is 'FAILED' and the task has excessive failures, the task status should be updated to 'DISABLED' and an error email should be sent. However, the logic for updating the status and handling scheduler_disable_time is not being executed properly, leading to the erroneous status comparison in the test case.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the 'FAILED' status and updating the task status should be revised to ensure that it follows the expected behavior as described in the test case.

Here's the corrected 'set_status' method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the adjustments were made to properly update the 'scheduler_disable_time' and the status based on the new status and the task's failure conditions. After the corrections, the test case is expected to pass without any assertion errors.
