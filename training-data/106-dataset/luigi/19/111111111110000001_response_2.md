The test case "test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed" sets up a scheduler with a configuration of one failure allowed before disabling a task and a disable persistence of 100 seconds. Then, it adds a task with a status of FAILED and checks if it's disabled, which it should be. After setting the time to 101 seconds, it checks if the task's status is still FAILED.

The error message indicates that the task's status is expected to be DISABLED after setting the time to 101 seconds, but it is actually FAILED.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for re-enabling a task after a certain amount of time if it had failed only once.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the re-enable logic is not properly implemented to set the task's status to FAILED when it should be re-enabled after a certain amount of time.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the task's status is properly updated to FAILED when it should be re-enabled after a certain amount of time.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            new_status = FAILED  # Set new_status to FAILED when re-enabling the task
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
In the corrected code, I added `new_status = FAILED` when re-enabling the task after it has reached the "DONE" status. This will ensure that the task's status is correctly updated to FAILED when it should be re-enabled after a certain amount of time.
