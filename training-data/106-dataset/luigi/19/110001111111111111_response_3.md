The error occurs in the `set_status` function. The function is intended to set the status of a task based on certain conditions, including if the task's status is changed to FAILED. If the task has excessive failures, it should be disabled and an error email should be sent. However, the code does not handle the case where the task status is already DISABLED.

The error message from the test function indicates that the status of the task 'A' is expected to be DISABLED after 101 seconds, but it is still showing as FAILED. This is due to the missing handling of the case where the task is already DISABLED when setting the new status in the `set_status` function.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the task is already DISABLED before changing its status. If it is, there should be no further action taken. This will ensure that the task status is not overridden when it is already DISABLED.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_status` function with the added check for task status:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    # Check if task is already DISABLED, if yes, no need to change its status
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where the task is already DISABLED and avoid changing its status inappropriately.
