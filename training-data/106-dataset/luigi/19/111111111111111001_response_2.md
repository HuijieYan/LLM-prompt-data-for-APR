The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` sets up a scheduler with certain parameters, adds a task to it, and then attempts to change the status of the task after a certain time has elapsed. The expected behavior is for the task status to change from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'` after 100 seconds.

The potential error in the problematic code lies within the `set_status` function, particularly in the logic where it handles the scenario of a task being set to the `'FAILED'` status. There is an incorrect comparison and logic after a task has failed, and the system needs to re-enable it after a certain time.

The reason behind the bug is that the current logic in the `set_status` function does not properly handle the transition of a task from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'` after a specified time has passed.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the change from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'` after a certain time needs to be updated so that the re-enablement of the task occurs as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Pass the config to the re_enable function

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED  # Update the new_status to DISABLED for excessive failures
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With the correction, the `re_enable` function is called with the appropriate `config` parameter, and the logic for transitioning the `new_status` from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'` has been updated to ensure that tasks are re-enabled after the specified time has elapsed.
