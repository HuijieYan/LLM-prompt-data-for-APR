The potential error in the given function is in the conditional statements that compare the `new_status` and `task.status`. There are also some undefined variables, such as `FAILED` and `DISABLED`, which are not defined in the given code snippet.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to compare the value of `new_status` with `FAILED` and `DISABLED`, which are not defined. Additionally, there are several undefined variables in the code, such as `config.disable_failures`, `config.disable_window`, and `config.disable_persist`.

To fix the bug, we need to define the variables `FAILED` and `DISABLED`, and also ensure that the comparison is done correctly. We also need to define the `can_disable()`, `add_failure()`, `has_excessive_failures()`, and `notifications` functions. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "failed"
    DISABLED = "disabled"

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "running":
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "done":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

Please note that in the corrected code, I assumed that the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` values should be of type string. If these are to be implemented differently, the code may need additional changes.
