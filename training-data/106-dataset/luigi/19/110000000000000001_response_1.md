The potential error location within the problematic function is the if-else statements that compare the new_status with certain task statuses and perform actions accordingly.

The bug in the code is that it is missing the definition of the variables FAILED, DISABLED and RUNNING. These seem to be constants or enums, and they need to be defined or imported for the code to work.

To fix the bug, we need to define or import the constants FAILED, DISABLED and RUNNING. Additionally, it seems like the code is trying to access the tasks' statuses and perform actions based on the new status. We should also ensure that task.status and task.scheduler_disable_time are accessible properties of the task object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "FAILED"
    DISABLED = "DISABLED"
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"
    
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                )
            )
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    # assuming _status_tasks is a dictionary
    if task.id in self._status_tasks[task.status]:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
