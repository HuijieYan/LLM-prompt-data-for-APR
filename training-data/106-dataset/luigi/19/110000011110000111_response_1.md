The error message from the test function indicates that the test is failing because it is expecting the status of task 'A' to be DISABLED after 101 seconds, but it is still showing as FAILED. This inconsistency suggests that the set_status method is not correctly updating the status of the task.

The potential error location within the set_status method is in the block of code responsible for handling the new_status of FAILED when task.can_disable() is true.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the task has excessive failures and gets disabled, the new_status is set to DISABLED, and an error email is sent. However, the code does not re-enable the task after the specified time (disable_persist), which leads to the task remaining in a DISABLED state.

To fix the bug, the set_status method should correctly re-enable the task after the specified time when it has been disabled due to excessive failures. 

Here's the corrected code for the set_status method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # reset the scheduler_disable_time
        elif new_status == RUNNING:  # re-enable the task if the new status is RUNNING
            self.re_enable(task)

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:  # only update the status if it's different from the current status
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, I added conditions to re-enable the task if the new status is DONE or RUNNING when the current status is DISABLED. Additionally, I included a check to update the status only if it's different from the current status.
