The issue in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the task status update. It checks for various conditions and updates the task status accordingly, but there are issues with the logic.

In the first test case, when the new status is 'FAILED', and the task status is 'PENDING', there are checks concerning disabling the task due to excessive failures, but the task's status should be updated based on the conditions.

In the second test case, when the new status is 'FAILED' and the task status is 'DISABLED', the function should handle the failed status differently than it does in its current state.

To fix the issues, the logic for updating the task status needs to be revised based on the expected behavior for each status transition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task}',
                    f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                    f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
                )
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status

    if new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = 0 if new_status == DONE else time.time() + config.disable_persist
```

In the corrected code:
- Removed unnecessary conditions and handled status updates based on the new status and the task's current status.
- Updated the scheduler_disable_time accordingly to match the correct logic based on the new status.
