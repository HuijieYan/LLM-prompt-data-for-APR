Potential error location: 
The error seems to occur when the status of task 'A' is being checked after the time has advanced to 101 seconds. The status should have changed from DISABLED to FAILED, but it appears that the status did not get updated.

Reason behind the bug:
The `set_status` function does not correctly handle the transitions between specific task statuses. There are also some conditional checks that may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect status assignments.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditionals for status transitions and ensure they are correctly evaluated.
2. Review the conditional checks and logic to ensure that the correct status is assigned based on the task's current status and the new status.
3. Implement any necessary checks for ensuring that the status transitions are accurate and complete.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

# corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
