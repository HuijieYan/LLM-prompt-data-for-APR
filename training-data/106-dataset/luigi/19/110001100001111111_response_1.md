The buggy function `set_status` is expected to update the status of a task. However, based on the provided information there seem to be several issues.

In the first case, when the `new_status` is 'FAILED' and the task has excessive failures, it should change the status to 'DISABLED' and set the `scheduler_disable_time` to the current time. It should then send an error email using the `notifications.send_error_email` method and return. The function should also handle scenarios where a task is already disabled.

In the second case, when the `new_status` is 'FAILED' and `task.failures` exceed the `config.disable_failures` value, it should disable the task, set the `scheduler_disable_time` to the current time, and update the status to 'DISABLED'. Similarly, it should also handle the case where the task is already disabled.

The main issues appear to be that the function does not handle all the conditional branches properly and the logic for changing the task status and disabling the task is incorrect.

To fix this, the 'set_status' function should be updated as follows:

```python
import time

class notifications:
    @classmethod
    def send_error_email(cls, subject, message):
        # Implementation of sending error email
        pass

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
            return

        if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        if task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.failures.count > config.disable_failures:
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))

    if new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
