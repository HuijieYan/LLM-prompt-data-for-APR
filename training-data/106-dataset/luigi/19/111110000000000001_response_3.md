Potential error location: 

The potential error is at the line `if new_status == FAILED: assert config is not None` as it is trying to compare new_status with a variable FAILED which is not defined. Additionally, there is no check for the status of the task.

Reason for the bug:

The bug is due to the comparison with the variable FAILED which is not defined in the code. Additionally, there is no check for the task status before setting the new status.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Define the variable FAILED.
2. Add a check to ensure that the task status is valid before setting the new status.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
