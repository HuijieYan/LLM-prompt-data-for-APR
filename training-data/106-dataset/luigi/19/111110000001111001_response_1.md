The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement under the condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():`. This is where the error is likely occurring based on the given input and expected output.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not handling the transition of task status to 'FAILED' correctly. When the new status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled, the function should update the task status to 'DISABLED', set the scheduler_disable_time, and send an error email notification. 

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the transition to 'DISABLED' status when the new status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled. This involves setting the task status to 'DISABLED', updating the scheduler_disable_time, and sending an error email notification to indicate the reason for the task being disabled.

Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
import time
import notifications

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = int(time.time()) + config.disable_persist
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task.id} due to excessive failures',
                    f'{task.id} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                    f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
                )
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With the corrections in place, the function now handles the transition of task status to 'DISABLED' correctly when the new status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled. Notifications are sent, and the required updates are made to the task status and scheduler_disable_time.
