The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is attempting to check if a task with only one allowed failure is re-enabled after 100 seconds. However, the test is failing because the status of the task is expected to be 'DISABLED' but it turns out as 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if` condition that handles re-enabling the task after it has been disabled due to excessive failures. There seems to be an issue with the transition of task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' and then to 'FAILED' again.

The bug occurs because the status of the task is not properly handled when re-enabling after being disabled due to excessive failures. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for transitioning the task status. The `re_enable` method should set the task status to 'PENDING' instead of 'DONE' and also reset the `scheduler_disable_time` to `None`. Additionally, the `add_failure` and `has_excessive_failures` methods should be updated to manipulate the `failures` attribute of the task class appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == PENDING:  # Reset status to PENDING when re-enabling
            self.re_enable(task)
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these changes, the function should handle the transitions between different task statuses correctly, and the test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` should pass without any assertion errors.
