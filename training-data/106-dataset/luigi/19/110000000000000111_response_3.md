Potential error location: The potential error in this function could be related to the conditions and logic for updating the task status.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. It seems that the function is not handling the status transitions and the related conditions properly.
2. The conditions for handling FAILED, DISABLED, and DONE status may not be handled correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the conditions for status transitions are properly checked and handled.
2. Double-check if the logic for handling FAILED, DISABLED, and DONE status transitions is correct.
3. Ensure that config is properly handled and not assuming any default values if it is not provided.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == "FAILED":
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == "DISABLED" and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
