The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking if the status of a task changes from `'DISABLED'` to `'FAILED'` after a certain amount of time has passed. However, the actual behavior is different, as the status remains `'DISABLED'`.

The potential error location is likely within the `set_status` function. It seems that the condition for re-enabling the task after 100 seconds is not being triggered correctly, resulting in the status not changing from `'DISABLED'` to `'FAILED'`.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the transition of task status from `'DISABLED'` to `'FAILED'` after a certain amount of time. The logic for re-enabling the task is not being executed as expected.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the condition for re-enabling the task after 100 seconds is correctly evaluated. This involves checking the scheduler_disable_time and comparing it with the current time to determine if the task should be re-enabled. Additionally, the status transition should be handled appropriately based on the conditions specified in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
import time

# Corrected set_status function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # re-enable the task if the scheduler_disable_time has elapsed
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
            self.re_enable(task)
        
            # reset scheduler_disable_time
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With the corrected logic, the task status transition should function as expected, and the test case should pass without encountering the assertion error.
