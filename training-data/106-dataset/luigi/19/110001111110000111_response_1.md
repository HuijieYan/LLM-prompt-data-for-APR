The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is trying to verify whether a task re-enables after 100 seconds. The test sets up a situation where a task is in a `FAILED` status, which should then transition to a `DISABLED` status and then return to `FAILED` status after 101 seconds.

The problem occurs in the `set_status` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. In this method, when a task fails and has excessive failures as per the configuration, it is supposed to transition to a `DISABLED` status. However, when the test attempts to verify the status of the task after 101 seconds, it fails because the task is still in the `DISABLED` status. This indicates that the task did not transition back to the `FAILED` status as expected.

The bug occurs because there is no logic in the `set_status` method to handle transitioning the task back to the `FAILED` status after the `DISABLED` status. This is resulting in the task being stuck in the `DISABLED` status.

To fix the bug, we need to add logic to handle the transition back to the `FAILED` status after the `DISABLED` status has elapsed. We also need to ensure that the transition between `FAILED` and `DISABLED` statuses happens correctly based on the number of failures and the specified time for disabling the task.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
from time import time

# ... (other imports) ...

class CentralPlannerScheduler:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
                new_status = FAILED  # Transition back to FAILED after re-enabling
    
            # handle re-enabling based on time elapsed
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and task.scheduler_disable_time + config.disable_persist < time():
                # time for disabling has elapsed, so change status to FAILED
                new_status = FAILED
                task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                # ... (send error email) ...
    
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time()  # Set the time when the task is disabled
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, we add a check for the time elapsed since the task was disabled, and if more time has passed than the specified `disable_persist` time, the task transitions back to the `FAILED` status. This ensures that tasks are not stuck in the `DISABLED` status indefinitely and are re-enabled based on the configuration settings.
