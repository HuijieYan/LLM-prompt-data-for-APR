The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the `task.scheduler_disable_time` is being assigned without incrementing the time.

The bug occurs because when the `new_status` is DISABLED and the task status is RUNNING, it should not change the status. However, in the given function, there is no condition to check for the task status RUNNING, so it always changes the status to DISABLED.

To fix the bug, the condition `if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:` should be added to prevent changing the status to DISABLED when the task status is RUNNING.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:  # added condition to check for RUNNING status
        return
    
    if task.status == RUNNING and new_status == DISABLED:  # added condition to check for RUNNING status
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
