The error occurs because the buggy function does not properly handle the transition of a task's status from FAILED to DISABLED. This transition should occur after a certain amount of time has elapsed, as specified by the `config.disable_persist` value.

The code inside the `set_status` function checks for the transition to FAILED and then immediately changes the status to DISABLED if the task has excessive failures. This causes the status transition to happen immediately, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the code should only change the status to DISABLED after the specified time has elapsed. The `config.disable_persist` field specifies the duration after which the task is disabled if it has excessive failures. This means that the status should only be changed if the current time minus the `task.scheduler_disable_time` is greater than or equal to `config.disable_persist`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
import time

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and (time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time) >= config.disable_persist:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                # status change will happen after a certain time, no immediate change here
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

The corrected code includes an additional check to see if the difference between the current time and the `task.scheduler_disable_time` is greater than or equal to `config.disable_persist` before applying the status transition from FAILED to DISABLED. This correction ensures that the task will only be disabled after the specified time has elapsed.
