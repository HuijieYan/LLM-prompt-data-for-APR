The potential error in the `set_status` function is that it is trying to access the `FAILED` constant and the `notifications` module without importing them. Additionally, there are some logical errors in the code that need to be fixed.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Using `FAILED` constant without importing it.
2. Accessing `notifications` module without importing it.
3. Logical errors in the if conditions.

Approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Import the `FAILED` constant.
2. Import the `notifications` module.
3. Correct the logical errors in the if conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
from luigi.task_status import FAILED, DISABLED
import time
import notifications

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # ... other code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == "DONE":
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(

                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,

            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
