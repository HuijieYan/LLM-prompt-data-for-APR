The error occurs in the `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` test case where it expects the status of task 'A' to be FAILED after setting the time to 101, but instead it is disabled. This suggests that the `set_status` function is not working as expected and wrongly setting the status to DISABLED instead of FAILED.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the conditional block where it checks for excessive failures and sets the status to DISABLED. It should be handling the new_status condition for FAILED and updating the status accordingly.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle the case where the new_status was set to FAILED after re-enabling the task. It should not check for the `task.can_disable()` condition and directly set the status to FAILED in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `set_status` function to correctly handle the case of re-enabling the task after a failure and the subsequent status change.

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    # handle re-enabling after a failure
    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task)
    elif new_status == FAILED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this corrected function, the `set_status` function will now handle the re-enabling of tasks after a failure correctly and set the status accordingly. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
