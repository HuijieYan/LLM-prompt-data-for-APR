The test case "test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed" is checking whether the task with ID 'A' automatically re-enables after 100 seconds. It sets up a CentralPlannerScheduler, adds a task with status FAILED, and then asserts that the task's status should be DISABLED after the failure. Finally, it sets the time to 101 seconds and checks if the task's status has changed back to FAILED.

The error message indicates that the assertion is failing, and the expected status is DISABLED, not FAILED.

Based on the error message and the nature of the error, it seems that the issue is likely in the "set_status" function where the status of the task is being set incorrectly.

It appears that the task status is getting set to FAILED instead of DISABLED when the failure conditions are met and the re-enable logic should be triggered.

To fix the bug, the conditions for setting the status to DISABLED need to be re-evaluated, and the logic for re-enabling the task after a certain time period needs to be checked.

Below is the corrected code for the "set_status" function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and new_status != DISABLED:
            return
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # set disable time
            new_status = DISABLED
            # send notification
        else:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # clear disable time
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This revised function includes the following changes:
1. Added logic to set the disable time for the task when there are excessive failures.
2. Modified the condition to clear the disable time when the task should not be disabled.
3. Updated the time comparison for scheduler_disable_time to consider the new status.
4. Added a comment to send notifications when the task gets disabled.

These changes are made to appropriately handle the task status transitions and ensure the re-enable logic works as expected.
