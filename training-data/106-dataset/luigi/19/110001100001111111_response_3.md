The buggy function is supposed to set the status of a task and handle different scenarios based on the new status provided. The function has some conditional checks and logic to handle the transition of the task status.

Based on the provided input and expected output, it seems that the logic inside the function is not correctly handling the transition to the 'DISABLED' status. In both of the provided cases, the status of the task should transition to 'DISABLED', but the buggy function is not setting the 'scheduler_disable_time' properly in the second case.

The reason behind this bug is related to conditional checks inside the function that don't cover all possible scenarios and transitions. In the second case, even though the status transitions to 'DISABLED', the 'scheduler_disable_time' is not set correctly.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks and status transitions need to be restructured and properly handled. Specifically, in the second case, when the status transitions to 'DISABLED', the 'scheduler_disable_time' should be updated with the current time plus the 'disable_persist' configuration value.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Task:
    def __init__(self, properties):
        self.id = properties.get('id', '')
        self.status = properties.get('status', '')
        self.scheduler_disable_time = properties.get('scheduler_disable_time', None)

class Failures:
    pass

class SimpleTaskState:
    def __init__(self):
        self._status_tasks = {}

class scheduler:
    pass

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = 'FAILED'
    DISABLED = 'DISABLED'

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist

    if new_status != task.status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the transition to 'DISABLED' status now correctly sets the 'scheduler_disable_time' based on the current time plus the 'disable_persist' configuration value. Additionally, the conditional checks have been restructured to handle all possible status transitions.
