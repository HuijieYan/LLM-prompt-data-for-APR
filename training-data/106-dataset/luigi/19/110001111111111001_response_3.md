The error message indicates that the status of task 'A' is not being updated as expected. It should transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after 100 seconds, but this transition is not happening.

The potential error in the code is the logic related to transitioning the status of the task. The condition that checks for excessive failures and disables the task is not triggering as expected.

The bug occurs because the condition to disable the task if it has excessive failures is not properly implemented. The logic for transitioning the task status and handling the disabling of the task needs to be revised.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly check for excessive failures and disable the task accordingly. The condition that handles the re-enabling of the task also needs to be reviewed to ensure it functions as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.failures < config.disable_failures:  # Check for excessive failures
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            # Send error email
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)

    if new_status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task

    task.status = new_status
```

With the updated code, the logic for transitioning the task status based on failures and disabling it when necessary is corrected. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the task status transitions occur as expected.
