The problem is that the function is incorrectly handling the status transition from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'`. The logic for this transition is not properly updating the status of the task and the scheduler_disable_time.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to add a proper condition to handle the status transition from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'`. This condition should also update the task status and scheduler_disable_time accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
            
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

The key fix here is to ensure that when the status transitions from `'FAILED'` to `'DISABLED'`, the `scheduler_disable_time` is correctly updated. This will allow the test case to pass as expected.
