The bug occurs in the "set_status" function. When "new_status" is set to "DISABLED", the function incorrectly sets the "task.scheduler_disable_time" to "time.time()", which is not correct. Instead, the "task.scheduler_disable_time" should be set to the current time plus the "config.disable_persist" value.

Here's the corrected code for the "set_status" function:

```python
import time

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return

        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)

            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Update scheduler_disable_time
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Update scheduler_disable_time

        # The following logic can be simplified and cleaned
        if task.status != new_status:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)  # Remove from previous status
            self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task  # Add to the new status
            task.status = new_status  # Update task status
```

The key change is in how "task.scheduler_disable_time" is updated. Instead of setting it directly to "time.time()", it is set to "time.time() + config.disable_persist" when "new_status" is set to "FAILED" or "DISABLED". This change ensures that the "scheduler_disable_time" reflects the current time plus the specified persistence duration.
