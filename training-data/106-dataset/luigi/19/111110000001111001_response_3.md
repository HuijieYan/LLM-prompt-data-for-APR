The buggy function is `set_status` in the `SimpleTaskState` class. The issue seems to be related to updating the task status and handling notifications based on status changes.

The first potential issue is with the if condition `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():` which leads to setting a new status and sending an error email. This might be causing undesired status updates.

Another potential issue is with the notification send, which may lead to an error in sending emails. The `notifications.send_error_email` function is being called without being imported and may not be accessible.

To fix these issues, we should refactor the logic for status updates and email notifications. Additionally, we need to ensure the `notifications` module is correctly imported and accessible.

Below is the corrected `set_status` function:

```python
import notifications
import time

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    )
                )

        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Update the scheduler_disable_time to the current time
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
In this corrected function, we made sure to import `notifications` and added the necessary changes based on the provided test cases and expected results.
