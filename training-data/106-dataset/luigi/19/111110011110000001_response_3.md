1. The test case is trying to verify the behavior of re-enabling a task after a certain period of time. It creates a new CentralPlannerScheduler, adds a task with status 'FAILED', checks if the status is 'DISABLED', and then advances time by 101 seconds to check if the status is still 'FAILED'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the status transitions.

3. The bug occurs because the status transition logic in the 'set_status' function is not correctly updating the task status when it should be re-enabled after the failure. As a result, the test case fails to check whether the task is re-enabled after 101 seconds.

4. To fix the bug, the 'set_status' function needs to be updated to correctly handle the status transitions and re-enable the task after the specified time interval.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def re_enable(self, task):
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
        task.status = DONE

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return

        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
        
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        if task.status in self._status_tasks:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        
        self._status_tasks.setdefault(new_status, {})[task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

The changes made include:
- Removing the condition for returning if the task's status is in DISABLED state in the initial part of the function.
- Modifying the re-enable logic inside the `set_status` function to properly update the task's status and reset disable time.
- Adding a check to ensure that the status being added to `_status_tasks` is initialized as an empty dictionary if it doesn't exist.

These changes should ensure that the task re-enablement logic works as intended, and the test case should pass after applying these fixes.
