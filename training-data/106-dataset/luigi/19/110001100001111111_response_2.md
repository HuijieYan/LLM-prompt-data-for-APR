Potential error location: The bug likely originates from the section that handles the `FAILED` status. There are several conditions and state changes that depend on this status, and it's likely that the issue arises from here.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of status changes and state transitions based on the new status. The implementation of these conditions and transitions may not accurately reflect the expected behavior, leading to incorrect status changes and updates.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The conditions and transitions for status changes need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct state changes occur based on the new status and the current task state.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task.id} due to excessive failures.',
                f'{task.id} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds.'
            )
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
