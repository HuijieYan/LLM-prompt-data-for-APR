The issue in the provided code is that the `set_status` function is incorrectly setting the task status to `FAILED` instead of `DISABLED` after re-enabling.

The error message from the test function `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` indicates that the task status is still `FAILED` instead of being re-enabled to `DISABLED` after the specified time.

The potential error location is within the section of the code that handles setting the new status for the task when re-enablement is required.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for setting the new status after re-enablement is not correctly implemented. Additionally, it seems that the condition for re-enabling the task after a certain duration is also not being checked properly.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for setting the new status after re-enablement and ensure that the task status is correctly updated.

Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Pass the config to re_enable function

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the `re_enable` function is called with the `config` parameter, which was missing in the original code. This ensures that the task re-enablement is handled properly. Additionally, the status is correctly updated based on the new status obtained from the conditions.

After making these changes, the test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` should pass without any assertion errors.
