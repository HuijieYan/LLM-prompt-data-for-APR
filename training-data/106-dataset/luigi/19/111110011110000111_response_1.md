The test case 'test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed' is trying to test if a task is re-enabled after 100 seconds when it has failed. The test sets the task status to 'FAILED' and then checks if it changes to 'DISABLED' after 101 seconds.

The error message indicates that the expected status is 'DISABLED', but the actual status is 'FAILED'. This means that the task status did not change as expected after 101 seconds.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the condition related to task status and task scheduler_disable_time.

The bug occurs because the conditions for changing the task status in the 'set_status' function are not being met correctly. The code is not properly handling the transition of task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain time period.

To fix the bug, the 'set_status' function needs to be updated to correctly handle the transition of task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain time period has passed.

Here is the corrected 'set_status' function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

    # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
    elif task.status == FAILED and new_status == DISABLED:
        current_time = time.time()
        if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and (current_time - task.scheduler_disable_time < config.disable_persist):
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this corrected function, the transition of task status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain time period should be handled correctly, and the test case should pass without the assertion error.
