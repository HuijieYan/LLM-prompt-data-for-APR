The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' is not changing from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' as expected. This discrepancy occurs when the function `set_status` is called with new_status as 'FAILED' and task.status as 'DISABLED'.

The issue is likely in the conditional block for `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():`. In this block, the task status is set to 'DISABLED', but it should actually be set to 'FAILED'. This results in the incorrect status and the test failure.

To fix this bug, the conditional block for `if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():` needs to be revised. The `new_status` should not be changed to 'DISABLED' within this block.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
This revision ensures that the task status is not erroneously changed to 'DISABLED' when the new status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled.
