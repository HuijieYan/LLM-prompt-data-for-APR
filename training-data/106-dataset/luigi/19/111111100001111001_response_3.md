The bug in the `set_status` function seems to be related to the `task` object and its status update. If the new status is "FAILED" and the task is eligible to be disabled, the status is updated to "DISABLED" and an error email is sent. However, after that, the `task` object status is not being updated properly, and the `scheduler_disable_time` is not being set if the status is changed to "DISABLED".

To fix this bug, you can modify the `set_status` function to properly update the `task` status and set the `scheduler_disable_time` when the status changes to "DISABLED". You should also remove the condition that directly compares `task.status` to "DISABLED" to avoid inconsistencies in the status update.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status != DISABLED:  # Remove the condition that directly compares task.status to "DISABLED"
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the scheduler_disable_time
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the scheduler_disable_time

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This corrected code properly handles the status update and setting the `scheduler_disable_time` when the status changes to "DISABLED".
