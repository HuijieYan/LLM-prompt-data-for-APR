The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the 'FAILED' status is being checked against the 'config' parameter, which may result in an assertion error if 'config' is not provided when the status is 'FAILED'.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is not handling the case where 'config' is not provided when the status is 'FAILED'.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to provide a default value for the 'config' parameter when the status is 'FAILED' and 'config' is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED and config is None:
        raise ValueError("Config parameter is required for status 'FAILED'")
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
