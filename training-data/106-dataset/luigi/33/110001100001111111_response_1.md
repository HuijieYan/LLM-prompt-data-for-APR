Potential error location: The `get_param_values` function is trying to access the `task_family` attribute as if it were a class attribute, rather than an instance attribute. This is causing the function to fail.

Reason for the bug: The `task_family` attribute is being accessed using `cls.task_family`, assuming that `cls` is the class itself. However, `task_family` is actually an instance attribute, so it should be accessed using `self.task_family` within a class method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the `get_param_values` method to an instance method by removing the `@classmethod` decorator and replacing `cls` with `self` wherever necessary to access instance attributes.
2. Change the way the `task_family` attribute is accessed within the `get_param_values` method to ensure it is accessed as an instance attribute.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_param_values(self, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = self.task_family

    # In case any exceptions are thrown, create a helpful description of how the Task was invoked
    # TODO: should we detect non-reprable arguments? These will lead to mysterious errors
    exc_desc = '%s[args=%s, kwargs=%s]' % (task_name, args, kwargs)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
