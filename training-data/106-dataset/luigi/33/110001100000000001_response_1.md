Potential error location: 

The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to assign a class method `task_family` to a variable `task_name`. However, `cls.task_family` is not callable, so it will result in an AttributeError.

Reason for the bug: 

The bug occurs because the `cls.task_family` is being accessed as an attribute without calling it as a method. It seems that the intention was to get the task family name for the class, but it is not being called correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `task_name` is being retrieved. Instead of `cls.task_family`, we can use `cls.__name__` to get the name of the class.

Corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = cls.__name__  # Corrected to get the class name

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
By making this change, the function will correctly retrieve the name of the class and avoid the AttributeError.
