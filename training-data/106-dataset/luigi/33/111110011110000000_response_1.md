    """
    This is the base class of all Luigi Tasks, the base unit of work in Luigi.
    
    A Luigi Task describes a unit or work.
    
    The key methods of a Task, which must be implemented in a subclass are:
    
    * :py:meth:`run` - the computation done by this task.
    * :py:meth:`requires` - the list of Tasks that this Task depends on.
    * :py:meth:`output` - the output :py:class:`Target` that this Task creates.
    
    Parameters to the Task should be declared as members of the class, e.g.::
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        class MyTask(luigi.Task):
            count = luigi.IntParameter()
    
    Each Task exposes a constructor accepting all :py:class:`Parameter` (and
    values) as kwargs. e.g. ``MyTask(count=10)`` would instantiate `MyTask`.
    
    In addition to any declared properties and methods, there are a few
    non-declared properties, which are created by the :py:class:`Register`
    metaclass:
    
    ``Task.task_namespace``
      optional string which is prepended to the task name for the sake of
      scheduling. If it isn't overridden in a Task, whatever was last declared
      using `luigi.namespace` will be used.
    
    ``Task._parameters``
      list of ``(parameter_name, parameter)`` tuples for this task class
