The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `@classmethod` decorator without an actual method inside the function definition.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@classmethod` decorator is used to define a method in a class that can be called from the class itself, without needing to create an instance of the class. However, in the given code, the method definition is missing within the function using the `@classmethod` decorator.

To fix the bug, we need to define a method inside the function and then use the `@classmethod` decorator to decorate that method so that it can be called as a class method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = cls.task_family

    # In case any exceptions are thrown, create a helpful description of how the Task was invoked
    # TODO: should we detect non-reprable arguments? These will lead to mysterious errors
    exc_desc = '%s[args=%s, kwargs=%s]' % (task_name, args, kwargs)

    # ... (the rest of the code remains the same) ...

    def list_to_tuple(x):
        """ Make tuples out of lists and sets to allow hashing """
        if isinstance(x, list) or isinstance(x, set):
            return tuple(x)
        else:
            return x
    # Sort it by the correct order and make a list
    return [(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]

@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    return get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, we define the `get_param_values` method and then use the `@classmethod` decorator to decorate it so that it can be called as a class method. We also define a separate `list_to_tuple` function inside the `get_param_values` function to fix the indentation issue.
