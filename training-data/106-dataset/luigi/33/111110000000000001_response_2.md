The potential error in the `get_param_values` function is the use of the `task_family` property as a method, rather than calling it as a property.

The reason for the error is that `task_family` is defined as a method, but it's being accessed as a property. This leads to incorrect behavior and may cause the function to fail.

To fix the bug, the `task_family` method should be accessed as a property by removing the `()` when accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_param_values` function:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = cls.task_family  # Accessing task_family as a property

    # ... (omitted code)

    # Sort it by the correct order and make a list
    return [(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]
```
With this change, the `task_family` property will be accessed correctly, and the function should work as expected.
