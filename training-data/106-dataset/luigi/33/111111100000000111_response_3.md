Potential error location: In the `get_param_values` function, the `task_name` variable is assigned the value of `cls.task_family`, which is intended to be a function. However, later in the code, it is treated as a string.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because `task_name = cls.task_family` is expected to return a function, but it actually returns the function object itself, not its name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of `task_name = cls.task_family`, it should be `task_name = cls.task_family.__name__` to get the name of the function.

Corrected code:
```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = cls.task_family.__name__  # Get the name of the function

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return [(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]
```
