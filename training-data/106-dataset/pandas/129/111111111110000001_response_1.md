The error occurs when the function tries to create a `DatetimeArray` using the `other` argument. In this case, the `other` argument is of type `numpy.datetime64`, which is not compatible with the `DatetimeArray` constructor. This leads to a `ValueError` being raised, as the function cannot handle the `numpy.datetime64` type.

To fix this issue, the code within the function needs to be updated to handle the `numpy.datetime64` type differently, or to handle it separately if it cannot be directly converted to a `DatetimeArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            other = pd.to_datetime(other)
        return other - self
    # Add other cases and their processing here
    # ...
    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, `pd.to_datetime()` is used to convert the `numpy.datetime64` instance to a Pandas datetime, which is then used in the subtraction operation. This handles the conversion of `numpy.datetime64` instances to a format that can be used in the subtraction operation. Other cases for different types can also be handled similarly within the function.
