The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the subtraction operation for different data types, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the subtraction operation for different data types. It seems to be trying to handle different cases of subtraction, but the logic is not clear and may not cover all possible scenarios.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the subtraction of different data types more explicitly and with clear logic.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
        return other.to_numpy() - self.to_numpy()
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        return self.to_numpy() - other.to_numpy()
    else:
        return NotImplemented
```

In this corrected function, we explicitly check for different data types and handle the subtraction operation accordingly. We also use the `to_numpy()` method to ensure that the subtraction is performed at the numpy array level, which should handle the different data types properly.
