The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to implement the subtraction operation (__rsub__) for a custom data type without properly handling all cases.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle all possible combinations of data types for subtraction. It is also missing the implementation for the __rsub__ method.

To fix the bug, the function should handle all possible combinations of data types for subtraction, including the case where the __rsub__ method is invoked.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    else:
        return NotImplemented
```
