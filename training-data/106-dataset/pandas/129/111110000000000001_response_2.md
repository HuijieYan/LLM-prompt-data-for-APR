The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__rsub__` method where there are multiple conditional statements for different data types and operations.

The bug occurs because the logic in the conditional statements is not correctly handling the different data types and operations. It seems that the function is trying to handle different data types and operations for subtraction, but the conditional statements and the logic within them are not correctly covering all the cases, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements and the logic within them should be revised to properly handle the different data types and operations for subtraction.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)

        return other - self
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other):
        # other (datetime) - self (timedelta) return DatetimeArray/Index
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)

        return other - self
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements are revised to properly handle the different data types and operations for subtraction. Additionally, the logic within the conditional statements is adjusted to cover all the cases and resolve the errors.
