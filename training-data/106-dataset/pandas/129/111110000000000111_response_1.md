Potential error location: The `__rsub__` method is trying to handle different cases where the subtraction operation might not be well-defined, but the logic for each case is unclear and may be incorrect.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of different data types and their subtraction operations within the `__rsub__` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Clearly define the logic for each case where the subtraction operation is not well-defined and handle it accordingly.
2. Use type-checking and conditional statements to ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the data types involved.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta, but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return pd.Timedelta(-other) + self  # swap the order of operations
        return (-self) + other
    return pd.NaT  # return Not a Time for invalid operations
```
