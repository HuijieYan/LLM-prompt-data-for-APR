The bug occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The bug is causing a `ValueError` because the `DatetimeArray` is not being created correctly so its values are not of the right format.

The bug occurs in the conditional block where it checks for `is_datetime64_any_dtype(other)` and `is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype)`.

To fix the bug, the `DatetimeArray` should be created properly with the correct values. This can be achieved by adding an additional condition to check if `other` is an instance of `Timestamp` or `datetime.datetime`, and then converting the `other` to the correct format before creating the `DatetimeArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            other = np.datetime64(other)
        elif isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            other = np.datetime64(other)
            
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # ... (other conditions) ...
```

In this corrected code, the `other` is checked for instances of `Timestamp` and `datetime.datetime` and then converted to `np.datetime64` if applicable. This ensures that the `DatetimeArray` is created with the correct values and the `ValueError` is avoided.
