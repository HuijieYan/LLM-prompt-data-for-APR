The buggy function is the `__rsub__` method, which is called when the right-hand operand of the subtraction is not satisfied, and the left-hand operand's `__sub__` method cannot process the operation.

The potential error in the method is the conditional checks for the types and attributes of the input arguments. The code does not handle all possible cases when subtracting `self` from `other`.

The error message being raised suggests that the type or attribute of `other` is causing the issue. This is consistent with the conditional checks in the method that try to identify the type and attributes of `other` and `self`.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks can be revised to cover all possible cases when subtracting `self` from `other`, which includes handling different data types and combinations of `self` and `other`.

The corrected code is provided below:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # wrap other in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_period_dtype(other.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # handle subtraction of timedelta from period
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # handle subtraction of timedelta from another timedelta
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # handle subtraction of datetime from non-datetime
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    else:
        # handle other cases
        return other - self
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been revised to cover all possible cases when subtracting `self` from `other`. This ensures that the method handles different data types and combinations of `self` and `other`.
