The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the issue is with creating a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable.

The reason for the bug is that the `DatetimeArray` is being created from the `other` variable without proper validation. The variable `other` should be validated to ensure it can be converted to a `DatetimeArray` before the conversion is attempted. Additionally, the error message clearly states that the type 'datetime64' is unexpected, which means the conversion is not handled correctly.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to validate the `other` variable to ensure it's compatible with creating a `DatetimeArray`. If it's not compatible, an appropriate error should be raised to indicate the incompatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, DatetimeArray)):
            raise TypeError("Cannot subtract from DatetimeLikeArrayMixin")
        return other - self
    # other cases...
```

In this corrected code, we added a validation check for the `other` variable to ensure it's either an instance of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` or `DatetimeArray`. If it's not, a `TypeError` is raised to indicate the issue. This prevents the unexpected type error encountered in the test function.
