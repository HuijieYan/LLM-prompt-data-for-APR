The error message indicates that there is an issue with creating a `DatetimeArray` object due to an unexpected type 'datetime64' when the function `__rsub__` is called.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `other = DatetimeArray(other)`. This is where the `DatetimeArray` is being created using the variable `other`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `other` variable being passed to `DatetimeArray()` is of type 'datetime64', whereas it should be of type `DatetimeArray`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__rsub__` function to handle the different types appropriately. If `other` is of type 'datetime64', it needs to be converted to a `DatetimeArray` before the subtraction operation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Convert other to DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray([other])

        return other - self

    # ... (other cases)
```

In the corrected code, I added a check for the type of `other` and converted it to a `DatetimeArray` if it's of type 'datetime64', before proceeding with the subtraction operation.
