The problematic function is __rsub__, which is used for implementing the right-hand subtraction operation.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to create a DatetimeArray from the 'other' variable. Specifically, the ValueError "Unexpected type 'datetime64'" is raised, indicating that the 'other' variable has an unexpected type for creating a DatetimeArray.

The bug is likely occurring because the 'other' variable is not being properly handled to create a DatetimeArray, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle different types of 'other' variables properly to create a DatetimeArray. In the cases where the 'other' variable is not suitable for creating a DatetimeArray, appropriate error handling should be implemented.

Here is the corrected code for the __rsub__ function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)
```

With these updates, the __rsub__ function should handle the 'other' variables properly, avoiding the ValueError that was being raised.
