The buggy function is designed to handle different cases based on the types of the `self` and `other` parameters. The function aims to handle different combinations of datetime, timedelta, and period types and perform appropriate subtraction operations. However, it appears that the logic inside the function is not handling these cases correctly.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the error might occur due to incorrect logic when performing subtraction between datetime, timedelta, and period types. The conditional checks and return statements inside the function may not cover all possible scenarios leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function's logic needs to be revised to handle the different combinations of input types correctly and perform the subtraction operation based on the given types. Additionally, the error messages and handling need to be improved to clearly indicate the type incompatibilities or invalid operations.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (pd.Timestamp, dt.datetime, np.datetime64)) and self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]'):
        return other - self
    elif isinstance(other, (pd.Timestamp, dt.datetime, np.datetime64)) and self.dtype.itemsize < np.dtype('<m8[D]').itemsize:
        return other - np.array(self)
    elif self.dtype == np.dtype('<m8[ns]') and isinstance(other, pd.Timedelta):
        return pd.Series(self) - other
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported operation between {type(self).__name__} and {type(other).__name__}")
```

This corrected code should handle the various type combinations correctly and perform the subtraction operation based on the input types, raising an error for unsupported operations between different types.
