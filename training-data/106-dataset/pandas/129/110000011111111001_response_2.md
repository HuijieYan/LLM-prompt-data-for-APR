The error is occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class due to the input value being of type `datetime64` instead of `DatetimeArray`. The method expects a `DatetimeArray` but is receiving a `datetime64` type, leading to a `ValueError` as it cannot handle this input.

To fix this issue, the method should be updated to handle `datetime64` type differently or to ensure that the input is transformed into a `DatetimeArray` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime64_any_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeArray):
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    # ... Other conditions and operations ...

    return -(self - other)
```

By adding the necessary import statements and handling the `other` input appropriately, the code should now properly handle the `datetime64` input and prevent the `ValueError` from occurring.
