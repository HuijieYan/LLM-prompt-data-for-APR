The issue arises from the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error is caused because when `__rsub__` is called, it attempts to create a `DatetimeArray` object using `other` which is of type `Timestamp` or `datetime`. The `DatetimeArray` class should not be instantiated with a value of type `datetime64`, resulting in a `ValueError`.

To fix the issue, the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class should check the type of `other` before attempting to create a `DatetimeArray` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not is_datetime_like(self):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            
            other = DatetimeArray([other])
        return other - self
    # rest of the conditions
```

In the corrected code, `is_datetime_like` is a hypothetical method that checks if the input is a valid datetime-like object. If it is not, a `DatetimeArray` object can be created with `other` and then the subtraction can be performed. This approach ensures that the instantiation of `DatetimeArray` is done correctly, avoiding the ValueError.
