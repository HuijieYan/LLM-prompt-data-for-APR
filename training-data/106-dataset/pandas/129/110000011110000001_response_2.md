The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method within the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message indicates that the `DatetimeArray` constructor is being called with an unexpected `datetime64` type, which is not supported.

The reason behind the bug is that the `DatetimeArray` constructor expects the input values to be a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or a Series or Index containing one of those, but it is receiving a `datetime64` type instead.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor is compatible with its requirements, i.e., it should be a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, a Series, or an Index containing one of those.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            other = pd.DatetimeIndex([other])
        return other - self
    # ... (other conditions remain unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input `other` is a `datetime64` type and if `self` is of type `timedelta64`. If `other` is not an instance of `DatetimeArray`, `pd.Series`, or `pd.Index`, we convert it to a `DatetimeIndex`, which satisfies the requirements of the `DatetimeArray` constructor.
