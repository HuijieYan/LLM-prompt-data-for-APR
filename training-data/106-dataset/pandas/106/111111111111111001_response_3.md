The test case involves creating a DataFrame with a non-unique datetime index and then attempting to drop labels that do not exist in the index. This test case aims to ensure that the `drop` function raises a KeyError when attempting to drop labels that are not present in the index.

The error occurs at the line `labels_missing = (axis.get_indexer_for(labels) == -1).any()` within the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file. This error is caused by a `NoneType` object being passed to `stargets = set(targets)`, resulting in a TypeError. The root cause of this issue lies in the problematic function `get_indexer_non_unique` within the `Index` class in the same file.

In the `get_indexer_non_unique` function, the code attempts to assign a value to `missing` which appears to have a `NoneType` value. This subsequently leads to the TypeError reported in the error message.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the `missing` variable holds a valid value and that it is not of type NoneType.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)

    # Validate missing to ensure it's not None
    if missing is None:
        missing = np.zeros(len(indexer), dtype=np.bool_)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining `missing` from `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)`, we include a check to ensure that the `missing` variable is not of type `None`. If it is `None`, then we assign it a valid default value as per the requirement.
