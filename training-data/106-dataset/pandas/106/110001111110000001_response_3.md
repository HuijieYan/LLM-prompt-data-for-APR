Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring at the line "df.drop(["a", "b"])". This line is trying to drop columns "a" and "b" from the DataFrame "df", but these columns do not exist in the index.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method. It seems that the method is trying to iterate over an object `targets` that is actually `None` and hence, it is raising a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over a `NoneType` object.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the value of `targets` before trying to iterate over it.
2. Handle the case where `targets` is `None` and return an appropriate value or raise an error to notify the calling code.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    if tgt_values is None:
        raise ValueError("Target values are None")

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for `tgt_values` to ensure it is not None before trying to use it. If it is None, we raise a ValueError to notify the calling code.
