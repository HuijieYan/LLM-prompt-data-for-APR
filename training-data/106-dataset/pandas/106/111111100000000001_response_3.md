The problematic function is `get_indexer_non_unique` in the `Index` class. The issue seems to be that the function is trying to access attributes and methods using incorrect syntax, and there are some missing imports.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The `ensure_index` function is being called without importing it.
2. The `np` module is being used without importing NumPy.
3. The code is trying to access `target.asi8` and `target._ndarray_values` as attributes and methods, but it should be calling these as functions/methods instead.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and make sure that we are using the correct syntax to access attributes and methods. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.indexes.base import ensure_index

class Index(IndexOpsMixin, PandasObject):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
    def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
        target = ensure_index(target)
        pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
        if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
            return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
        
        if self.is_categorical():
            tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
        elif self.is_all_dates():
            tgt_values = target.asi8()
        else:
            tgt_values = target._ndarray_values()
    
        indexer, missing = self._engine().get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
