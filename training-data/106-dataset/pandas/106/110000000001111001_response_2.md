The potential error in the provided code is that the function `get_indexer_non_unique` is not handling the if-else conditions correctly. The code inside the function is trying to handle different data types and conditions, such as handling categorical data, dates, and other non-unique values, within a single if-else block without proper separation.

The code is also not using the `self` parameter properly, as it's not providing the expected results when `self` is modified after calling `_maybe_promote`.

To fix the bug, we can revise the if-else conditions for handling different data types and conditions separately. Additionally, we should ensure that `self` and other variables are used consistently and appropriately within the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import Index, ensure_index
import numpy as np

def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In this corrected code, we have fixed the if-else structure to handle different data types and conditions separately. We also ensured that the `self` parameter and other variables are used consistently and appropriately within the function.
