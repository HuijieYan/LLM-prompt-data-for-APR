The error occurs when the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `DatetimeIndex` class encounters a `TypeError` because the variable `targets` is being used without being defined. This suggests that there is a variable renaming issue within the function that causes `target` to be renamed as `targets` at some point, resulting in a `NoneType` error when it is called later in the function.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the variable names used consistently throughout the function.
2. Make sure that the correct variable `target` is used at all places, and there are no typos such as `targets`.
3. Ensure that all variables are properly assigned and used as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer_non_unique`:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    # Correctly ensure the index if needed
    target = ensure_index(target)
    
    # Use self to ensure promotion
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    
    # Check if the promotion occurred
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    # Check if the target is categorical
    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    # Use asi8 if the target is all dates
    elif target.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    # If it is neither categorical nor all dates, use ndarray values
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values
    
    # Call the _engine.get_indexer_non_unique method with target values
    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code:
- The correct variable `target` is consistently used throughout the function.
- The asi8 method is called correctly as `target.asi8()`.
- The `is_all_dates` attribute is accessed as `target.is_all_dates`.
- The `get_indexer_non_unique` method from the `_engine` is called with `tgt_values`.

By fixing the variable renaming and ensuring that the correct methods and attributes are accessed, the issue causing the `TypeError` should be resolved.
