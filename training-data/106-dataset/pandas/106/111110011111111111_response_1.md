The test case provided is related to an error that occurs when dropping columns from a DataFrame with a non-unique DatetimeIndex without specifying the target columns. The error message indicates a TypeError, specifically "'NoneType' object is not iterable."

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `Index` class. This is evident from the error traceback indicating the `get_indexer_non_unique` method.

The TypeError occurs because the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is trying to iterate over a NoneType object, which is not iterable. This may be due to incorrect data type handling or invalid data passed to the function.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the method is handling the input data correctly and that the logic to handle different data types, including non-unique DataFrame Index, is properly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` method:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif ptarget.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = ptarget.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = ptarget._data
    
    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
In the corrected code, the following changes have been made:
1. `ptarget` is used instead of `target` to ensure correct handling of the input DataFrame Index.
2. The condition for checking `is_all_dates` is corrected to use `ptarget` instead of `self`.
3. The data type of `tgt_values` is handled appropriately depending on the type of `ptarget`.
4. The `asi8` method is called on `ptarget` to convert the values to integers for non-datetime objects.

After applying these changes, the `get_indexer_non_unique` method should handle different types of input data correctly and resolve the TypeError caused by incorrect data type handling.
