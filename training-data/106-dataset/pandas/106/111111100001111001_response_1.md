The test case depicts the buggy function `get_indexer_non_unique`, which is a method of the `Index` class. This method is intended to return an indexer array and an array of booleans indicating missing elements, by handling different cases based on the characteristics of the target input.

However, in the given test case, the function does not appear to be handling the different cases correctly. The function is using the values and types of the target and self, then attempting to manipulate its inputs. Given the input attributes, the analysis of the runtime values and types before the return of the buggy function illustrates that the processing within the function is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic related to the `is_all_dates` attribute. This logic seems to be incorrectly using the attribute without invoking it as a method. Additionally, there is an inconsistency in the handling of the `is_categorical` attribute of the target input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the different cases based on the characteristics of the target input. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional logic to properly use the `is_all_dates` method, as well as ensuring that the `is_categorical` attribute is correctly accessed and used.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer_non_unique` is as follows:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if target.is_categorical():
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values
    
    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In this corrected code:
1. The `is_all_dates` and `is_categorical` attributes are correctly used as methods by invoking them with parentheses.
2. The conditional logic on the characteristics of the target input has been updated to handle the different cases appropriately.
