The buggy function get_indexer_non_unique() is intended to take an index-like array target, promote it if necessary using _maybe_promote(), and then extract the indexer and missing data using _engine.get_indexer_non_unique(). However, it is not performing all these steps correctly.

The input parameter 'target' is being correctly changed to an Index object through the ensure_index() function, but the conversion is unnecessary because the type of 'target' is already Index. Also, the function _maybe_promote() is not used correctly. It should be used to potentially promote the target, but in the current implementation, it is being used to promote 'self' and 'target' always, which is unnecessary and leads to unnecessary object creation and get_indexer_non_unique() calls.

To fix this issue, the conditions within the function should be adjusted to use the correct logic for checking if promotion is necessary. Additionally, the behavior for handling missing or incorrect input types should be added to improve robustness.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    if not isinstance(target, Index):
        raise ValueError("target must be Index type")

    if self is not target and not isinstance(target, self.__class__):
        raise ValueError("target must be the same type as the index")

    if target.is_categorical():
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif target.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.astype('datetime64[ns]').asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
