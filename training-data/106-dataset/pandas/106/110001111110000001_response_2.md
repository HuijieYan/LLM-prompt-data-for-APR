The error message indicates a 'TypeError' and suggests that a 'NoneType' object is not iterable. This likely means that the 'targets' variable is None at the point where it is being used as an iterable (e.g., in a 'for' loop or with the 'set' function).

Upon analyzing the problematic function 'get_indexer_non_unique', it appears that the error might be occurring due to the 'tgt_values' variable being set incorrectly. The function first checks if the 'target' is categorical or if it contains all dates, and based on that condition, it determines the 'tgt_values'. However, there seems to be a typo or missing code where 'tgt_values' is being assigned.

To fix this bug, we will need to ensure that 'tgt_values' is set correctly based on the conditions provided in the function. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the 'target' is None, to avoid the 'NoneType' error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'get_indexer_non_unique':

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    if target is None:
        raise ValueError("Target index is None")

    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)

    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    else:
        if self.is_all_dates():
            tgt_values = target.asi8()
        else:
            tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine().get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added a check for 'None' in the 'target' variable to avoid the 'NoneType' error.
- Fixed missing parentheses for the function calls 'self.is_all_dates' and 'target.asi8' to correctly trigger the functions.
- Fixed the function call 'self._engine()' to ensure it is called as intended.

These changes should address the bug and prevent the 'TypeError' encountered in the test case.
