The error is occurring in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `pandas.core.indexes.base` module. The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable" is confusing and not directly related to the actual issue in the code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code where the `tgt_values` variable is assigned. It seems that the logic for determining `tgt_values` based on the type of `target` is incorrect, leading to the erroneous behavior.

The bug is likely occurring because when `target` is not categorical and the index is not all dates, the `_ndarray_values` attribute is accessed, which may not exist or be compatible with the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug:
1. Check for the type of `target` and handle the cases of categorical data and all dates separately.
2. Handle the case when `target` is not categorical and the index is not all dates to correctly determine `tgt_values`.
3. Ensure that the correct `tgt_values` is passed to the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique` method.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical_target:
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target.values  # Access the correct attribute for non-categorical and non-all-dates index

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected function, we handle the non-categorical and non-all-dates index case by using the `values` attribute of the `target` instead of `_ndarray_values`. This should resolve the bug and prevent the confusing error message from occurring.
