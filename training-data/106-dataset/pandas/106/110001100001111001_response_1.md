The buggy code is the `get_indexer_non_unique` method in the `base.py` file of the pandas library. 

The potential error in the code is that the condition, `self.is_all_dates` is not being evaluated correctly within the `if` statement. Instead of accessing the `is_all_dates` attribute of the `self` object, it is calling it directly on the `target` object, which is incorrect.

This is likely causing issues because it leads to incorrect evaluation of the condition and therefore incorrect assignments and operations within the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the correct checks and method calls need to be made on the appropriate objects. Specifically, the condition for checking `is_all_dates` should be evaluated on the `self` object. Additionally, the correct method or attribute needs to be called based on the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if self.is_categorical():
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition `self.is_categorical()` and `self.is_all_dates()` checks are called on the `self` object instead of the `target`.
- The `target.asi8` is replaced with `target.asi8()` to correctly call the `asi8` method on the `target` object.
