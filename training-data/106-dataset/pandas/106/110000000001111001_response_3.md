The error in the provided function seems to be related to the `self.is_all_dates` attribute. The function is trying to access `self.is_all_dates` as if it's an attribute of the `target` object, which results in an error because `target` is an array and does not have an `is_all_dates` attribute.

To fix this, the function needs to access the `is_all_dates` attribute of the `self` object instead of the `target` object. It seems that the function is trying to check if the index is of type datetime, so it should check the type of the index rather than the type of the target variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)

    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(self):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif isinstance(self, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        tgt_values = self.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = self._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_categorical` function now takes `self` as an argument to determine if the index is categorical.
- The check for datetime type has been modified to use `isinstance` with `pd.DatetimeIndex` to check if `self` is a datetime index.
- The `tgt_values` is determined based on the type of the `self` index.
- The function should now work correctly without the attribute error.
