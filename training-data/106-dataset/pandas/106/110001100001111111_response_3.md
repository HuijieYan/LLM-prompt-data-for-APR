Based on the provided test case and the associated error message, it appears that the bug is located in the 'get_indexer_non_unique' method of the 'pandas.core.indexes.base' module. The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable" suggests that there is an issue with the iteration or processing of a 'NoneType' object within this method.

The provided information also includes the runtime values and types of various variables within the 'get_indexer_non_unique' method. It's evident that there is a misinterpretation or processing error for a 'NoneType' object which leads to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, it's crucial to ensure that the method handles 'NoneType' objects appropriately. As the provided context doesn't include the entire code, it's essential to consider refactoring the logic around the variables 'self._engine' and 'tgt_values' to handle potential 'NoneType' scenarios.

Here's the corrected 'get_indexer_non_unique' method that addresses the handling of 'NoneType' objects:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    if self._engine is not None:  # Check if self._engine is not None
        indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
    else:
        # Handle the 'NoneType' appropriately
        raise ValueError("_engine is None")
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to ensure that the '_engine' attribute is not 'None' before invoking the 'get_indexer_non_unique' method on it. If the '_engine' is 'None', it raises a ValueError to notify that the '_engine' is None and handle this scenario appropriately in the calling code.
