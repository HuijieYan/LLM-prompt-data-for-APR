The test case `test_drop_with_non_unique_datetime_index_and_invalid_keys` defines a dataframe `df` with a non-unique datetime index and then attempts to drop specific labels that do not exist in the index. This results in a `KeyError` when calling the `drop` method on the dataframe with the non-existent labels.

The error message indicates that the code fails at `pandas/_libs/index.pyx:307` due to a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.

On analysis of the provided problematic function `get_indexer_non_unique`, it appears that the issue lies in the statement `stargets = set(targets)`. The variable `targets` seems to be undefined or None, leading to the TypeError when trying to create a set from it.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to validate the input parameter `target` and ensure it is not None before trying to create a set from it.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    if target is not None:  # Add a check for None
        pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
        if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
            return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

        if is_categorical(target):
            tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
        elif self.is_all_dates:
            tgt_values = target.asi8
        else:
            tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

        indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
    else:
        return None  # Return a default value or handle as appropriate
```

In the amended code, we first check if the `target` is not None before performing any operations on it. If it's None, a default value is returned or it is handled as appropriate. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring due to input validation issues.
