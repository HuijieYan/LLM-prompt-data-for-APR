The error occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function when the `tgt_values` variable is not being assigned properly. The bug is likely related to the incorrect assignment and retrieval of the `tgt_values` variable, leading to a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

To fix this bug, you need to make sure that the `tgt_values` variable is assigned properly based on the type of the `target`. You should also handle cases where the type of `target` is different, such as categorical or all dates.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target.values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected function, I've added `()` to the `self.is_all_dates` to call this as a method. Additionally, I modified `tgt_values = target._ndarray_values` to `tgt_values = target.values`, as it's more appropriate to use the `values` attribute for retrieving the values of the index.

These changes should ensure that the `tgt_values` variable is assigned correctly and the TypeError should be resolved.
