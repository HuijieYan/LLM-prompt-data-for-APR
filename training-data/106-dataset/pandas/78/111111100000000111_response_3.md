The issue arises in the `_reduce` function of the `SubclassedDataFrame` class. The problem is that the `sum` operation returns a pandas Series instead of the expected SubclassedSeries, which breaks inheritance from pandas DataFrames.

The bug is located in the `_reduce` function of the `SubclassedDataFrame` class in the file `core/frame.py` of the pandas library. The issue occurs when the `constructor` is not being used to create a new instance, resulting in the return of a pandas Series instead of a SubclassedSeries.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_reduce` function to use the `constructor` to create a new instance, ensuring that the correct SubclassedSeries is returned. We can do this by replacing the line:

```python
result = Series(result, index=labels)
```

with:

```python
if constructor is None:
    result = Series(result, index=labels)
else:
    result = constructor(result, index=labels)
    # Alternative:
    # result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)
```

This change ensures that the `constructor` (SubclassedDataFrame) is used to create a new instance, returning the expected SubclassedSeries.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if constructor is None:
        result = Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)
        # Alternative (since constructor will create a SubclassedDataFrame):
        # result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)

    return result
```
