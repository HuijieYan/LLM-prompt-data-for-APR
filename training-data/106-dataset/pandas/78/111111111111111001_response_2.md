The error is occurring in the `test_subclassed_boolean_reductions` test function, where it asserts that the result of the reduction operation should be an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`, but the assertion fails.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `_reduce` method of the `SubclassedDataFrame` class. The function is supposed to perform reductions on a DataFrame, and it seems to be returning a boolean Series. This Series is used in the test, but the test expects a different type of series, leading to the assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `_reduce` method does not return the expected type of series and does not handle the reduction operation properly.

To fix the bug, the `_reduce` method should be updated to appropriately handle the reduction operation and return the correct type.

Here's the corrected `_reduce` method:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if numeric_only:  # Handling numeric reduction
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        result = data.apply(op, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    else:  # Handling other types of reduction
        result = self.apply(op, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    return result
```

In this corrected method, we handle numeric reduction separately and apply the operation on numeric data. For non-numeric reduction, we simply apply the operation on the DataFrame itself. This ensures that the correct type of result is returned, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
