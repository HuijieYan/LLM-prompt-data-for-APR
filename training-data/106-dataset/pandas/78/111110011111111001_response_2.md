The error occurs in the assert statement of the test function. The test function tries to use the `isinstance` method to check if the result is an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`. However, the buggy function is not producing the expected output.

The potential error location within the buggy function is when the result is created based on the `filter_type` and `axis` values. 

The bug occurs because the logic within the `_reduce` function is not properly handling the `filter_type` and `axis` values when determining the result. As a result, the expected output is not being generated, causing the test functions to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_reduce` function needs to be revised to properly handle the `filter_type` and `axis` values to generate the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same...
```

By revising the logic to handle the `filter_type` and `axis` values properly, the corrected code should now produce the expected output when used in the test function, resolving the bug.
