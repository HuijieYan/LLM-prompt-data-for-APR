The bug is likely located within the `_reduce` function of the `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame` class. The function is intended to apply a reduction operation, such as sum or mean, to the DataFrame while correctly handling axis, data types, and index creation.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect return type of the reduction operation. Specifically, the `_reduce` function seems to be returning a pandas Series instead of the expected SubclassedSeries, which is causing assertions to fail in the test cases.

Potential Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the logic within the `_reduce` function to ensure that the correct constructor (`_constructor_sliced`) is used to create the output. This involves checking whether the `constructor` is None and using the appropriate constructor to create the result as a SubclassedSeries.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Check if the constructor is None
    if constructor is None:
        # Use the subclassed constructor to create the result
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)
    else:
        # Use the original constructor to create the result
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

By making this change, the `_reduce` function should now correctly return a SubclassedSeries instead of a pandas Series. This should address the bug related to incorrect return types and ensure that the assertions in the test cases do not fail.
