The error appears to be occurring when the `sum()` function is applied to a subclassed DataFrame. The issue seems to be related to the `_reduce` function in the DataFrame class, which is responsible for performing reductions like sum, mean, etc.

The problem is most likely arising from the fact that the `result` is being initialized as a regular `pandas.Series` instead of the expected `SubclassedSeries`. This is causing the assertion failure in the test case because the `result` is not being instantiated as a `tm.SubclassedSeries`, which is expected by the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_reduce` function to instantiate the result as a `SubclassedSeries` or `SubclassedDataFrame` based on the type of constructor present.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    def _get_data(axis_matters):
        if filter_type is None or filter_type == "numeric":
            data = self._get_numeric_data()
        elif filter_type == "bool":
            if axis_matters:
                # GH#25101, GH#24434
                data = self._get_bool_data() if axis == 0 else self
            else:
                data = self._get_bool_data()
        else:  # pragma: no cover
            msg = (
                f"Generating numeric_only data with filter_type {filter_type} "
                "not supported."
            )
            raise NotImplementedError(msg)
        return data

    result = f(self.values)

    if hasattr(result, "dtype") and is_object_dtype(result.dtype):
        try:
            if filter_type is None or filter_type == "numeric":
                result = result.astype(np.float64)
            elif filter_type == "bool" and notna(result).all():
                result = result.astype(np.bool_)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):

            # try to coerce to the original dtypes item by item if we can
            if axis == 0:
                result = coerce_to_dtypes(result, self.dtypes)

    if constructor is not None:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `constructor` is not None. If it's not None, we use it to instantiate the result as a `SubclassedSeries` or `SubclassedDataFrame` based on the type of constructor. If it's None, we fall back to `self._constructor_sliced` to ensure that the correct subclassed object is returned.
