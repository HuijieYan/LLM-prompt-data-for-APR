The error occurs in the `test_subclassed_boolean_reductions` function, where it is trying to assert that the result of calling `all()` or `any()` on a `SubclassedDataFrame` instance is an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`. However, the assertion fails.

The potential error location is within the `_reduce` method, where the result is being returned. The bug seems to be in the `_reduce` method's handling of the `constructor` when returning the result. It appears that the method might not be correctly constructing the result as an instance of `Series` or `SubclassedSeries`.

The bug occurs because the `_reduce` function is not correctly handling the constructor for creating the result. This results in the incorrect type being returned, even though the data is calculated correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the constructor is correctly used to create the result as an instance of `Series` or `SubclassedSeries`, depending on the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    result = f(values)

    if constructor is not None:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, after obtaining the result, it makes use of the `constructor` to correctly create the result as an instance of `Series` or `SubclassedSeries`.
