The bug occurs when performing boolean reductions on a subclassed DataFrame, as the expected output is a subclassed Series, but the actual output is a regular Series. This is due to the `_reduce` function, which doesn't handle the creation of subclassed Series properly.

The bug is located in the `_reduce` function of the provided code. This function is responsible for reducing the DataFrame to a Series, and it should return a subclassed Series if the DataFrame is subclassed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_reduce` function to correctly handle the construction of the Series and ensure that it returns a subclassed Series when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    if constructor is None:
        result = Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)
        # alternative (since constructor will create a SubclassedDataFrame):
        # result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we modified the part where the Series is constructed. If the constructor is available, we use it to create the subclassed Series. Otherwise, we directly create a regular Series. This change ensures that the subclassed Series is returned when reducing the DataFrame.
