Potential error location: The if-elif-else statements in the _isna_old function seem to be the source of the bug.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of different data types within the if-elif-else statements. The function seems to be checking for various data types and then calling different methods based on the type of the input object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle different data types more systematically and ensure that the correct methods are called based on the type of the input object. Additionally, the condition checks should be managed in a way that doesn't lead to conflicting logic.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _isna_old(obj):
    """
    Detect missing values, treating None, NaN, INF, -INF as null.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray or object value

    Returns
    -------
    boolean ndarray or boolean
    """
    if pd.api.types.is_scalar(obj):
        return libmissing.checknull_old(obj)
    elif isinstance(obj, pd.MultiIndex):
        raise NotImplementedError("isna is not defined for MultiIndex")
    elif isinstance(obj, (pd.Series, np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        return libmissing.checknull_old(obj)
    elif isinstance(obj, pd.core.generic.NDFrame):
        return obj._data.isna(func=_isna_old)
    elif isinstance(obj, list):
        return libmissing.checknull_old(np.asarray(obj, dtype=object))
    elif hasattr(obj, "__array__"):
        return libmissing.checknull_old(np.asarray(obj))
    else:
        return obj is None
```
In the corrected code, the function checks for the type of the input object and then calls the appropriate method to check for missing values. The handling of different data types is more cohesive and less prone to conflicting logic.
