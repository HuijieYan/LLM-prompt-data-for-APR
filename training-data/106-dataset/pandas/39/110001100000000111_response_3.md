1. The test case involves creating a dataframe, removing a specific column in-place, and then performing an operation on a separate variable that was created using the removed column. The issue is that the in-place operation seems to be affecting the variable that was created using the removed column.

2. The potential error location in the code is the "add_special_arithmetic_methods" function, specifically where the inplace methods are being wrapped and called.

3. The bug is caused by the inplace methods updating the dataframe without proper checks, resulting in unexpected behavior when attempting to perform operations on a variable that was created using the removed column.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the inplace methods to preserve the original dataframe when performing the operation. This can be achieved by creating a copy of the dataframe before performing the operation in an inplace method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """

    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """

        """
