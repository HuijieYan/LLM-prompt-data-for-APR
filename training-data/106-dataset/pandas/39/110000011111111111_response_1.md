The bug is likely occurring in the `_wrap_inplace_method` function, which is used to create an in-place wrapper for the special arithmetic methods. The error messages from the test functions suggest that the in-place operations are not producing the expected results, resulting in DataFrame shape mismatches.

The bug is likely caused by the inconsistency in creating the in-place wrappers for the special arithmetic methods. This inconsistency leads to incorrect in-place operations when the methods are called.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the in-place wrappers are created correctly for each special arithmetic method. This involves properly aligning the input and updating the inplace operation result. The method used to create in-place wrappers needs to be revisited and modified to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )
    
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)

            # Update the inplace operation result
            inplace_result = result.reindex_like(self, copy=False)._data
            
            # Ensure proper alignment of inputs
            inplace_result = inplace_result.align_like(self, try_shorthand=True)

            # Update the inplace data with the result
            self._update_inplace(inplace_result, verify_is_copy=False)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    # Additional check for inplace methods
    inplace_methods = [
        "__iadd__",
        "__isub__",
        "__imul__",
        "__itruediv__",
        "__ifloordiv__",
        "__imod__",
        "__ipow__",
        "__iand__",
        "__ior__",
        "__ixor__",
    ]

    for method_name in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[method_name] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[method_name.replace('i', '')])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

With this correction, the in-place arithmetic operations should now produce the expected results and resolve the DataFrame shape mismatches reported in the test cases.
