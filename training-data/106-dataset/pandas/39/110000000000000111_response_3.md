The problem seems to be occurring due to the inplace operations in the function `add_special_arithmetic_methods`. The inplace operations are updating the dataframe incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug is caused by the `inplace=True` argument in the `df.drop("target", axis=1, inplace=True)` line. When this operation is performed, the dataframe is updated in place, but the `y` variable (which is a separate reference to the "target" column) behaves unexpectedly. It seems that the inplace operation is affecting the `y` variable, which is unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the inplace operations from the `_wrap_inplace_method` method. This method seems to be causing the unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

By removing the `_wrap_inplace_method` and the inplace operations, we eliminate the potential cause of the bug related to the `inplace=True` behavior. This will ensure that the dataframe and the variables referencing its columns behave as expected, without unexpected side effects.
