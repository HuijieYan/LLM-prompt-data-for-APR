The bug appears to be related to the `__ixxx__` operations (inplace operations) in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function. The error message from the test function indicates that the DataFrame shape is different from the expected value, which suggests that the inplace operation is not being performed correctly.

The reason behind the bug could be the implementation of the `_wrap_inplace_method` function. It seems that the new_methods dictionary is being updated with the inplace methods, but there might be an issue with the inplace operation logic within the function.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the inplace methods perform the correct operation on the input DataFrame. This may involve checking the logic for inplace operations and how they update the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            # Perform the inplace operation on the input DataFrame
            result = method(self, other)

            # Update the DataFrame inplace with the result
            self._update_inplace(result, verify_is_copy=False)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    inplace_methods = ["__iadd__", "__isub__", "__imul__", "__itruediv__", "__ifloordiv__", "__imod__", "__ipow__", "__iand__", "__ior__", "__ixor__"]
    
    # Update new_methods with inplace methods
    for inplace_method in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[inplace_method] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[inplace_method.replace('i', '')])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)

```

In the corrected code, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function has been modified to correctly perform the inplace operation on the input DataFrame. The new inplace methods are added to the `new_methods` dictionary, and then the `_add_methods` function is called to update the class with the new methods. This should address the issue with the inplace operations not being performed correctly.
