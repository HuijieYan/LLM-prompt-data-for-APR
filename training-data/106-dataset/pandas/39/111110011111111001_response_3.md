The error message indicates that the DataFrame `df` and the expected DataFrame `expected` are different, specifically in shape. This could be due to the in-place operations not being performed correctly, which is the responsibility of the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the inplace operations are not properly being added to the class. This could be causing the incorrect behavior in the test cases.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the inplace methods are correctly defined and added to the class. This includes properly wrapping the method and adding it to the new_methods dictionary. Additionally, the `_add_methods` function should be reviewed to ensure that the new inplace methods are being added to the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        Return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            self._update_inplace(
                result.reindex_like(self, copy=False)._data, verify_is_copy=False
            )
            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    inplace_methods = {
        "__iadd__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__add__"]),
        "__isub__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__sub__"]),
        "__imul__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mul__"]),
        "__itruediv__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__truediv__"]),
        "__ifloordiv__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__floordiv__"]),
        "__imod__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mod__"]),
        "__ipow__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__pow__"]),
        "__iand__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__and__"]),
        "__ior__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__or__"]),
        "__ixor__": _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__xor__"]),
    }

    new_methods.update(inplace_methods)

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In this corrected code, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function properly wraps the method for inplace operation and adds it to the `inplace_methods` dictionary. This dictionary is then merged into the `new_methods` dictionary, ensuring that the inplace operations are correctly added to the class.
