The bug is occurring in the method `add_special_arithmetic_methods` within the `pandas/core/ops/methods.py` file. This method is intended to add special arithmetic methods to a class, but it seems to be incorrectly defining and implementing inplace operators.

The bug occurs because the `_wrap_inplace_method` function is not properly updating the instance's data after performing the inplace operation.

To fix the bug, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function should be modified to ensure that the inplace update is correctly applied to the class's instance data.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` method:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )
    
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """
        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)

            # inplace operation, updating the instance directly
            self._update_inplace(result)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f
    
    inplace_methods = ["__add__", "__sub__", "__mul__", "__truediv__", "__floordiv__", "__mod__", "__pow__", "__and__", "__or__", "__xor__"]

    for method_name in inplace_methods:
        inplace_method = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[method_name])
        new_methods[f"__i{method_name.strip('__')}__"] = inplace_method
    
    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the `_wrap_inplace_method` function to directly update the instance data through the `_update_inplace` method. We have also simplified the addition of inplace methods by iterating over a list of method names and adding them dynamically.

With these changes, the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function should add the special arithmetic methods with properly implemented inplace operators.
