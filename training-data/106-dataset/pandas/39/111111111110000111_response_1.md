The error in the provided function is occurring due to the incorrect behavior of the `inplace` operation in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function. 

When performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation in-place, the operation should modify the original DataFrame (`df`) accordingly. However, the code is currently not updating the DataFrame as expected.

To fix this bug, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the inplace operation. The corrected method should update the DataFrame in-place after performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            
            # Update the DataFrame in-place after performing the operation
            self[other.name] = result

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    new_methods.update(
        dict(
            __iadd__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__add__"]),
            __isub__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__sub__"]),
            __imul__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mul__"]),
            __ipow__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__pow__"]),
        )
    )

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

By updating the DataFrame in-place within the `_wrap_inplace_method` function, the bug should be resolved, and the DataFrame modifications should be reflected correctly.

This correction should ensure that the inplace operators update the DataFrame as expected, fixing the bug and aligning the function's behavior with the expected functionality.
