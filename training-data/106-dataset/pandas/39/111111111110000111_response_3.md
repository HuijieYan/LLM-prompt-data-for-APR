The function `add_special_arithmetic_methods` is meant to add special arithmetic methods to a class. The bug seems to be related to the inplace operations, particularly the methods `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`, `__idiv__`, and so on.

The bug appears to be related to the `inplace` logic and the update of the dataframe. This is causing the dataframes to have different shapes, leading to assertion errors in the test cases. The bug lies in how the inplace methods are being applied and the subsequent update of the dataframes.

To fix the bug, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function needs to be updated to correctly implement inplace operations. This may involve using the `update` method instead of the `_add_methods` function.

The corrected function would look something like this:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )
    
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            self.update(result)
            return self
    
        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f
    
    inplace_methods = ["__iadd__", "__isub__", "__imul__", "__itruediv__", "__ifloordiv__", "__imod__", "__ipow__", "__iand__", "__ior__", "__ixor__"]
    
    for inplace_method in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[inplace_method] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[inplace_method.replace("i", "")])
    
    cls.__dict__.update(new_methods)
```

This updated code ensures that the inplace operations correctly update the dataframe and maintains the shape and structure while performing the specified operation.
