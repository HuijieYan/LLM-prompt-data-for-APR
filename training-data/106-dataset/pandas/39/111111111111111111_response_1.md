The problem here is that the `df.drop` method, when used with `inplace=True`, is creating an incorrect dataframe, which is causing the subsequent operations to fail.

The bug is likely in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function where the `DataFrame` is created and methods are defined. The problem could be occurring in the `_add_methods` function in the same file, where the new methods are added to the class.

The issue seems to be related to the modification of the dataframe in place, which is causing the subsequent operations to be applied to the modified dataframe incorrectly, leading to failure in the test.

To fix this problem, you should consider ensuring that the inplace drop operation is completed correctly and does not affect the subsequent operations on other columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """
        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            # Correctly updating the inplace drop operation
            self = self.drop(labels=other.name, axis=1)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    new_methods["__iadd__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__add__"])
    new_methods["__isub__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__sub__"])
    new_methods["__imul__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mul__"])
    new_methods["__itruediv__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__truediv__"])
    new_methods["__ifloordiv__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__floordiv__"])
    new_methods["__imod__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mod__"])
    new_methods["__ipow__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__pow__"])

    new_methods["__iand__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__and__"])
    new_methods["__ior__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__or__"])
    new_methods["__ixor__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__xor__"])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

The change here is to properly handle the inplace action in the `_wrap_inplace_method` and apply the drop operation correctly before returning the modified dataframe.

This fix should address the issues identified in the test cases and resolve the bug.
