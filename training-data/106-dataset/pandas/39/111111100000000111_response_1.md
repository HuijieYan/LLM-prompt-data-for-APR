The issue is related to the behavior of inplace operations in Pandas, specifically in the `df.drop` method. When the `inplace=True` argument is used, the method removes the specified column from the DataFrame in-place. However, the variable `y` still seems to be affected by the change, even though it is a separate variable from the DataFrame.

The identified function `add_special_arithmetic_methods` is related to in-place arithmetic operations. The issue might lie in how the in-place operations are being implemented in this function, and it could potentially cause unexpected behavior when combined with the Pandas inplace operations.

The bug is likely occurring due to the in-place operations defined in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function. The wrapped inplace methods are not updating the DataFrame as they should, or they might be inconsistently modifying the DataFrame.

To address the bug, the in-place methods should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they correctly update the DataFrame. Additionally, the behavior of the inplace operations in combination with other operations, such as the `df.drop` method, should be considered to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    inplace_methods = [
        "__iadd__", "__isub__", "__imul__", "__itruediv__",
        "__ifloordiv__", "__imod__", "__ipow__",
        "__iand__", "__ior__", "__ixor__"
    ]

    for method in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[method] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[method.strip('i')])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In the corrected code, a loop is used to iterate through the inplace methods. Each method is then updated with the corresponding wrapped inplace method. This should ensure that the inplace methods behave consistently and correctly update the DataFrame when used in combination with other operations.
