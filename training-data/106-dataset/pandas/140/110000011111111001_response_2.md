The error message indicates a KeyError at line `idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])` in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. This suggests that the bug is related to accessing columns of the DataFrame `result` using their indices.

The buggy function attempts to iterate over the indices of the DataFrame columns and check if each column is of object dtype. However, it seems that the indices are not guaranteed to start at 0 and be continuous, which leads to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can use the `result.columns` directly to iterate over the columns and check their dtype. This will ensure that we are checking all columns correctly without relying on their positional index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for column in result.columns:
        if is_object_dtype(result[column]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(result[column].values, convert_numeric=False)
            result[column] = converted

    return result
```
