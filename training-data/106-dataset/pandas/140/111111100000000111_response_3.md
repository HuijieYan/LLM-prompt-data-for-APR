Potential error location:
The error is likely related to the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, which is used to coerce dates when stacking can easily have object dtypes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The issue seems to be related to the conversion of datetime-like columns, where the function may not be handling the conversion properly, leading to a KeyError in the apply function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `_recast_datetimelike_result` function should be modified to handle datetime-like columns properly and avoid any KeyError issues when used in conjunction with the `apply` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[result.columns[n]] = converted  # Update the column with the converted values

    return result
```
