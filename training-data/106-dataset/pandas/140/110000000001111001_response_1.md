The error in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is that it is trying to directly access columns using their integer index, which leads to incorrect processing of the data.

The bug is occurring because the function is assuming that the DataFrame columns will be accessed using integer indices, but the actual indices are not integers, they are of type `Int64Index`. This is causing the function to fail when trying to access and convert the object type columns in the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the column access using the column names instead of integer indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = pd.to_numeric(result[col], errors='coerce')
        result[col] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `select_dtypes` to select only the columns with object data type.
- We then iterate over these object type columns directly, converting their values to numeric using `pd.to_numeric` with the `coerce` option to handle non-convertible values.
