The test case is trying to apply a lambda function to a DataFrame grouped by column "a" and then create a Series with a single value "spam" and an index label of 42. The bug occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function in the pandas library.

The error message indicates a `KeyError: 0` occurred in the function `get_item`. This indicates that there is an issue with accessing items in the DataFrame, potentially related to the conversion of datetime-like objects within the DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the `obj_cols` variable is being generated based on identifying object type columns using `is_object_dtype`. However, this approach may not be handling datetime-like columns properly, leading to the KeyError when attempting to access elements of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correctly identify columns that contain datetime-like objects and handle their conversion appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time-like objects in the original, then coerce dates as we are stacking, which can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : pd.DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
    """

    result = result.copy()

    dtypes = result.dtypes
    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_datetime64_any_dtype(dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )
        result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result
```
