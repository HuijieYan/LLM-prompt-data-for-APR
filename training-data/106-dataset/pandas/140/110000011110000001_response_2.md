The test case `test_apply_datetime_issue` is attempting to group by the "a" column and apply a lambda function that creates a series with the value "spam" and index 42. The bug occurs when one of the columns in the DataFrame is a datetime object and the column labels are different from standard int values in the range of the number of columns. This triggers a KeyError within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function.

The error occurs because the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is attempting to modify the DataFrame `result` by iterating over the object columns and converting them using the `maybe_convert_objects` function. However, in the test case, the column "b" has a datetime object (group_column_dtlike) and is being used as a key for the groupby operation.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function to handle datetime objects properly and prevent it from modifying non-object column types unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype` to check for datetime and timedelta column types instead of `is_object_dtype`.
- In the iteration over `obj_cols`, we only attempt to convert the column if it is of object type, avoiding unnecessary modification of non-object column types.
- This approach ensures that the function only attempts to modify datetime or timedelta columns that are of object type, which resolves the error seen in the test case.
