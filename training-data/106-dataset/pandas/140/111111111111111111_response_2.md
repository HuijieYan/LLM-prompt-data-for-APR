The error occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The bug seems to be related to the `obj_cols` variable, which identifies the columns that have object data types. In this case, it incorrectly identifies the first column as having an object data type, which leads to a `KeyError` later in the code.

The reason behind the bug is that `obj_cols` is being calculated incorrectly, likely due to a mistake in the logic of identifying object data types. This leads to the `KeyError` when trying to access the first column in the `result` DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the logic for identifying object data types in the `obj_cols` list needs to be corrected. It should accurately check for object data types and include only those columns in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx, col in enumerate(result.dtypes) if is_object_dtype(col)
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we're using `enumerate(result.dtypes)` to iterate through the columns and their data types. Then we check if each column has an object data type and include it in the `obj_cols` list accordingly. This should ensure that only columns with object data types are included, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
