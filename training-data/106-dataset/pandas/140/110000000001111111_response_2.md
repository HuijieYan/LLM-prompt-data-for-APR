The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the for loop that attempts to coerce date/time like values in the DataFrame.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the for loop is not handling the date/time column properly, leading to a KeyError. This is related to having a datetime column in the DataFrame.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the date/time column separately and ensure that the coercion is done correctly for this type of data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas.api.types as pdtypes

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if pdtypes.is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if pdtypes.is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            result.iloc[:, n] = pd.to_datetime(result.iloc[:, n])

    return result
```
