The test function `test_apply_datetime_issue` tries to group by column "a" and then apply a function that returns a Series with index [42]. The expected behavior is to obtain a DataFrame with the index "a" and column 42 containing the values returned by the apply function.

The error message indicates a KeyError at the line `result = df.groupby("a").apply(lambda x: pd.Series(["spam"], index=[42]))`, suggesting that the apply function is not generating the expected output.

The potential error location within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is the conversion of object type columns. In particular, the `result.iloc[:, n] = converted` line may be causing the error.

The bug occurs because the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function attempts to reassign the partially modified DataFrame back to itself. This can cause inconsistencies, especially since the `iloc` function creates a view of the DataFrame rather than a copy. As a result, attempting to modify the original DataFrame through this view can lead to unintended behavior, such as the KeyError observed in the error message.

To fix this bug, a deep copy of the DataFrame should be used instead, and the modified copy should be returned.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import possibly_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result_copy = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result_copy.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result_copy.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = possibly_convert_objects(result_copy.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False)

        result_copy.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result_copy
```

With this correction, the function now returns a modified copy of the input DataFrame, which prevents unintended side effects and potential errors.
