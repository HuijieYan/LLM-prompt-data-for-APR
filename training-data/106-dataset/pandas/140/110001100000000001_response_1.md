Potential error location: The potential error is occurring in the loop that iterates through the obj_cols and attempts to convert the values to numeric using `maybe_convert_objects`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because `maybe_convert_objects` function does not exist in the pandas library. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Replace the `maybe_convert_objects` with a correct function or method that will achieve the desired conversion.

Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # Convert object columns to numeric
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = pd.to_numeric(result.iloc[:, n], errors='coerce')
        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
