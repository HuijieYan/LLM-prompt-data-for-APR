The error occurs when the `apply` method is called on the dataframe `df`. Specifically, the `apply` method involves the creation of a new Series with an index `[42]`. This index is expected to match the column labels of the resulting dataframe `result`. However, the function `_recast_datetimelike_result` fails to handle this mismatch between the index and the column labels, leading to a KeyError related to the index value `0`.

The potential location of the error is within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, where the loop over `obj_cols` and the subsequent attempt to replace the original values may cause issues with the index and column label alignment.

The correction for this issue involves ensuring proper alignment between the index created in the `apply` method and the column labels of the resulting dataframe. This can be achieved by resetting the index of the resulting dataframe before returning it.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    
    # Reset index to ensure alignment with column labels
    result.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

    return result
```
