Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the loop that iterates through the object columns and tries to convert them using 'maybe_convert_objects' function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the loop is iterating through the columns and trying to convert them without considering the column's data type.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking if the column data type is object before attempting to convert it.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects

# this is the fixed function
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
