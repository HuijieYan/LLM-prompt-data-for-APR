The error is related to an issue with the `apply` method when used in combination with `groupby` and a DataFrame containing a datetime column. The error occurs when converting the datetime-like column to another type, causing a KeyError.

Based on the error message and the provided function, the potential location for the bug is within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly when converting the object data type columns.

The bug occurs because the function `_recast_datetimelike_result` is attempting to coerce date/time columns to a different data type, which results in a KeyError when the apply method is called on a DataFrame with a datetime column.

To fix this bug, the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function should first check whether a given column is a datetime-like column and only apply the conversion to non-datetime-like columns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if not is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected function, a check for datetime-like columns is added to ensure that only non-datetime columns are converted. This should prevent the KeyError when the `apply` method is called on a DataFrame with a datetime column.
