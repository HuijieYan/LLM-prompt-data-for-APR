1. The test case `test_apply_datetime_issue` is attempting to apply a lambda function on a DataFrame grouped by a particular column, and then creating a new Series with a specific index. The issue seems to be related to the presence of a datetime column in the DataFrame.

2. The error message suggests that the problem is occurring within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function in the `generic.py` file.

3. The error occurs because the function is iterating over object type columns and attempting to convert the values. This iteration includes the datetime column as well, causing the KeyError due to an incorrect value being generated as part of the conversion process.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the datetime column separately and avoid unnecessary iterations and conversions. By doing so, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.series import maybe_convert_objects
from pandas import DataFrame

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx, dtype in result.dtypes.items() if is_object_dtype(dtype) and dtype.name != 'datetime64[ns]'
    ]
    
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we updated the selection of object columns to exclude the datetime column. This modification should prevent the KeyError from occurring and provide the expected behavior even with datetime columns in the DataFrame.
