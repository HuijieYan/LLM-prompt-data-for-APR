The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the for loop where it's trying to convert object columns to datetime data types. The bug is likely occurring because of the changes in the internal representation of the DataFrame object in pandas 0.25.1 compared to 0.24.2.

To fix the bug, the for loop that converts object columns to datetime data types should be modified to use the proper index and column names. It should also handle the case where the column dtype is already datetime, and ignore it during conversion. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the input DataFrame `result` does not have any object columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes).any():
        result = result.copy()

        obj_cols = [
            idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
        ]

        # See GH#26285
        for n in obj_cols:
            if is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
                # Skip if the dtype is already datetime
                continue
            
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result[result.columns[n]].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result[result.columns[n]] = converted
    return result
```

The modified function checks if there are any object dtype columns in the input `result`, and only then proceeds with the conversion. It also handles the case where the dtype is already datetime and skips the conversion for such columns.
