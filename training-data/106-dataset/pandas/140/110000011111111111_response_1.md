The test case `test_apply_datetime_issue` provides a DataFrame with columns "a" and "b". The "b" column contains dates in datetime format. The test then applies a lambda function to create a Series with index [42], which causes the error.

The potential error location is the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly in the loop that iterates through the object columns.

The reason for the bug is that in the loop, the `obj_cols` variable is created with indices of object columns. Then, in the subsequent loop, the conversion is not handled correctly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access index 0.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion of objects and adjust the indices properly. We can iterate through the DataFrame's columns, check for object data types, and convert them accordingly, without modifying the original DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype, maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time-like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for i in range(len(result.columns)):
        if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[i]):  # Check for object datatype
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, i].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, i] = converted

    return result
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the DataFrame's columns and check for object data types. If an object data type is found, we convert the values using `maybe_convert_objects` and then assign the converted values back to the DataFrame. This should resolve the KeyError issue and fix the bug.
