The issue seems to be related to the `apply` function failing when there is a datetime column in the dataframe. The specific error message is "KeyError: 0."

The problematic function `_recast_datetimelike_result` is intended to coerce dates when there is a date/time-like column in the DataFrame. However, it seems that the function is not handling the datetime columns correctly, leading to the KeyError issue.

It is likely that the `result.iloc[:, n] = converted` line in the function is not handling datetime columns properly, resulting in the KeyError when the `apply` function is called later.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the datetime columns correctly and ensure that they are converted properly without causing any KeyError.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for col in result.select_dtypes(include=['datetime']):
        result[col] = maybe_convert_objects(result[col], convert_numeric=False)

    return result
```

In the corrected function, we are iterating through the datetime columns in the DataFrame and using `maybe_convert_objects` to convert the datetime objects properly. This should resolve the issue related to the KeyError when using the `apply` function.
