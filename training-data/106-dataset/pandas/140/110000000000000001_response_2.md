Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the for loop where it loops through the object columns and attempts to convert them using maybe_convert_objects.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The error could be caused by using the maybe_convert_objects function improperly.
2. The loop may not correctly update the DataFrame due to incorrect indexing.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the apply method to apply the maybe_convert_objects function to the object columns, instead of using a for loop.
2. Ensure that the indexing is correct to update the DataFrame with the converted values.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype, is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.common import maybe_convert_objects
from pandas import DataFrame

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()
    
    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

    result[obj_cols] = result[obj_cols].apply(maybe_convert_objects, convert_numeric=False)

    return result
```
