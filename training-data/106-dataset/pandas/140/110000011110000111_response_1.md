The test case `test_apply_datetime_issue` is trying to apply a lambda function to a DataFrame and create a new Series using the `pd.Series` constructor with the `index` parameter set to a single value. This is causing an error, as the `pd.Series` constructor expects the index to have unique values.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly when trying to retrieve the values at a specific index, which is resulting in a `KeyError: 0`.

The bug is occurring because the `pd.Series` constructor is being used with an index that has a single value, which causes Panda to attempt to retrieve the value at index 0. This causes an error, as the index should have unique values.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use a unique index with the `pd.Series` constructor.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

This fix ensures that a unique index is used when creating the series, thereby preventing the KeyError that was occurring.
