The test case is trying to use the `apply` function on a DataFrame grouped by the 'a' column, and then return a single column DataFrame using `pd.Series` with index `[42]`. The buggy function `_recast_datetimelike_result` is likely causing an issue due to the way it handles datetimelike objects, which leads to a KeyError.

The error occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, where the `obj_cols` list contains the index `0`, and the `converted` array contains only one value. So when the function tries to access `result.iloc[:, n]` it uses `n=0`, resulting in a KeyError because the required index is not available in the dataframe.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the loop in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function operates on the correct columns and indices without causing a KeyError.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if len(result.iloc[:, n]) > 0:
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the loop now checks if the length of `result.iloc[:, n]` is greater than 0 before trying to access it. This ensures that only existing indices are accessed, preventing the KeyError.
