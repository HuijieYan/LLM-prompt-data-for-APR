The error occurs when the `apply` function is called on the dataframe groupby object. It then calls the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, which handles converting date/time like objects in the dataframe. The issue arises from the way the `obj_cols` are calculated and then applied on the `result` dataframe. 

1. The test case is passing a datetime object as a column value to the dataframe and then applying a groupby operation based on another column. This is a valid use case scenario.

2. The potential error location is identified within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, where the `obj_cols` are used to iterate over the columns of the dataframe.

3. The bug occurs because the `obj_cols` are being identified incorrectly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access index 0 of the dataframe. This is due to the way `obj_cols` are being calculated from the dataframe `result`.

4. To fix the bug, the `obj_cols` should be recalculated based on the actual object columns in the dataframe.

5. Corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx, dtype in enumerate(result.dtypes) if is_object_dtype(dtype)
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `obj_cols` are calculated based on the `result.dtypes` to identify the object columns correctly. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring when trying to access specific columns in the dataframe.
