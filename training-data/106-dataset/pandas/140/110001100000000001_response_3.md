Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the for loop where it is attempting to convert the object dtypes to numeric dtypes.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring because the for loop is attempting to convert object dtypes to numeric dtypes without checking if the dtype is already numeric.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the for loop to check if the dtype is already numeric before attempting to convert it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if not is_numeric_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
