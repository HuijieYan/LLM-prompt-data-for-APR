The issue described in the GitHub post indicates that the `apply` function on a grouped DataFrame with a datetime column is throwing a KeyError in Pandas 0.25.1, while it runs as expected in Pandas 0.24.2.

The potential error location within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is the for loop where it is attempting to convert object types to numeric types for datetime-like columns. It seems that this conversion is causing issues when the `apply` function is called on the grouped DataFrame.

The error is likely occurring because the conversion of datetime-like columns to numeric types is interfering with the grouping and applying of functions to the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function to handle datetime-like columns differently in order to avoid the KeyError when using the `apply` function on the grouped DataFrame.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            continue  # Skip datetime-like columns

        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to skip the conversion step for datetime-like columns, which should prevent the KeyError from occurring when using the `apply` function on a grouped DataFrame with datetime columns.
