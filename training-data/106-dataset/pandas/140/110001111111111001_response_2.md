The error occurs when the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function tries to access the `result.dtypes[idx]` value, as it looks for an index that doesn't exist.

The bug is happening because the function is looping through the `obj_cols` and trying to reassign values based on the index. The original code assumes that there is at least one datetimelike column, but in the case of the test, there isn't.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the function to check the length of `result.columns` and only perform the reassignment if there are columns present.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    if len(result.columns) > 0:  # Check if there are columns present
        result = result.copy()

        obj_cols = [
            idx
            for idx in range(len(result.columns))
            if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
        ]

        # See GH#26285
        for n in obj_cols:
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

This updated code first checks if there are columns present in the result before performing any operations that depend on column indices. If there are no columns present, it skips the reassignment process, avoiding the KeyError that was occurring in the buggy code.
