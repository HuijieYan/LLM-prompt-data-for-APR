The error occurs when the `result` DataFrame has datetime columns, and the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is not handling them properly, leading to a `KeyError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the following block of code:

```python
for n in obj_cols:
    converted = maybe_convert_objects(
        result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
    )

    result.iloc[:, n] = converted
```

The bug occurs due to the `converted` variable being assigned without considering that it could have datetime columns.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `maybe_convert_objects` function should be handling datetime columns properly, but it is not. This leads to a mismatch in the dtype of the columns, causing the `KeyError` in subsequent operations.

To fix the bug, we need to handle datetime columns properly in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. This can be achieved by checking if the converted dtype is a datetime dtype and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )
        
        if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
        else:
            # Handle non-datetime columns
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result
```
