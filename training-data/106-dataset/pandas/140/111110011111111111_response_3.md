The error occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function where it tries to create `obj_cols` using a list comprehension. It seems that the `is_object_dtype` function is not working as expected. This function should check if the data type is an object, but it is probably returning incorrect results, causing the KeyError when trying to access the index using `result.dtypes[idx]`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `is_object_dtype` function is not correctly identifying the object data type in the dataframe. This could be due to changes in the pandas library between versions 0.24.2 and 0.25.1.

To fix this bug, we need to find a reliable way to identify the object data type correctly and then create the `obj_cols` using the correct indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if result.dtypes[idx] == 'object'
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
