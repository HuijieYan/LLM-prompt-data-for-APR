The error message indicates that a KeyError is being raised at `pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper.pxi:998`. This indicates that the bug is likely within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, specifically within the obj_cols list comprehension.

The error is occurring because the index `[0]` is being used in the `obj_cols` list comprehension, and then being used as an index to access the `result.dtypes` Series. However, using the number `0` as an index is resulting in a KeyError because there is no column in the DataFrame with an index label of `0`. 

The bug likely occurred due to changes in the behavior of pandas between versions 0.24.2 and 0.25.1, which caused the KeyError to be raised in the more recent version.

To fix the bug, we may need to handle the case where the `obj_cols` list is empty, or handle the indexing differently to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    if obj_cols:
        for n in obj_cols:
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
    
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the `obj_cols` list is not empty before iterating through it. This avoids the KeyError that was occurring when trying to access an index that doesn't exist.
