Potential error location: The error occurs when the `result` DataFrame is being processed within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. Specifically, the error is triggered in the line `obj_cols = [idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])]`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug arises from the fact that the function is assuming `result` to have at least one datetimelike column, and is trying to convert the datetimelike column to ensure it is not of object dtype. However, the assumption fails when the `result` DataFrame contains no datetimelike columns, resulting in the `obj_cols` list being empty and consequently causing the `KeyError` during further processing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `obj_cols` list is empty, and if so, skip the conversion step and return the original `result` DataFrame.
2. Ensure that the function only performs datetimelike conversion if there are datetimelike columns present in the `result` DataFrame.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    if any(result.dtypes.isin([np.datetime64, np.timedelta64])):
        obj_cols = [
            idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
        ]

        for n in obj_cols:
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

The corrected code includes a check to determine if the `result` DataFrame contains any datetimelike columns before attempting to convert the datetimelike columns. If no datetimelike columns are present, the function skips the conversion step and returns the original `result` DataFrame.
