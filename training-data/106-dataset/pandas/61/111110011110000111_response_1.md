The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be part of a larger class `Series` that handles one-dimensional arrays with axis labels. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing, but it contains conditional statements and type checks that might be leading to unexpected behavior. The test cases are trying to test the function with different types of indices and failing to raise `ValueError` as expected.

The error message indicates that the function is not raising `ValueError` when it should.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the conditional statements for handling different types of keys might not be covering all possible scenarios. Additionally, the function contains multiple return statements based on different conditions, and it's not clear whether the control flow guarantees that only one return statement will ever be reached.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be refactored to handle different types of keys more uniformly, ensuring all possible cases are covered and a clear path for the program execution is established. Furthermore, the function should only reach one return statement at the end.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                sub_key = key[0]
                if isinstance(sub_key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(sub_key)
                else:
                    raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
                indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
                return self.iloc[indexer]
            else:
                return self._get_values(key)
        
        # handle other cases like list, ndarray, etc.
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This refactored code provides a more comprehensive and unified approach to handling different key types, ensuring that the correct type-specific actions are taken and the correct type-specific return operations are executed. This refactored code should resolve the issues encountered in the test cases.
