The potential error location in the problematic function is in the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index))` block. This block is trying to handle various types of keys for indexing the Series, but the logic seems to be incorrect.

The error occurs because the code is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing the Series, but the logic is incorrect in handling non-list or non-array keys.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to reorganize the conditional statements and handle the different types of keys separately to ensure the correct indexing behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            return self._slice(key)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
                # handle the case of list, numpy array, Series, and Index
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                # handle other types of keys by reindexing
                return self.reindex(key)
```
