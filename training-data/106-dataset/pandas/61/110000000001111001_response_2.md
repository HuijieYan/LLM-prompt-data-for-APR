The given function is responsible for slicing and indexing a Series object based on the input key. However, there are multiple issues with the function. 

Firstly, the function has multiple handling cases for different types of keys such as slices, DataFrame, tuples, etc. However, in many of these cases, the function uses methods like `_get_values_tuple`, `_get_values`, `loc`, `iloc`, and `reindex`, which are not actually defined within the context of the function, leading to potential AttributeErrors.

Secondly, the function has variables named `self._slice`, `self._get_values_tuple`, `self._get_values`, `self.loc`, `self.iloc`, and `self.reindex` that are supposed to be methods or attributes of the Series class, but they appear to be custom methods and attributes. This suggests that the function has been implemented incorrectly, as it is trying to use methods and attributes that don't exist within the Series class.

Finally, the error message which states "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported" suggests that there might be a type check missing to handle the DataFrame index case.

To fix these issues, the function should be refactored to use the correct methods and attributes of the Series class for slicing and indexing. Additionally, the function should include appropriate type checks to handle the different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.

Here's the corrected function without changing its signature:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check for DataFrame key
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        return self[key]  # Using slice directly for indexing
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self.loc[key]  # Using .loc with tuple for indexing
    else:  # For other types of keys like list, np.ndarray, Index etc.
        return self[key]
```

In this corrected function, we have removed the custom methods and attributes and used the existing methods and attributes of the Series class. We have also included an appropriate type check for DataFrames and used direct indexing or `.loc` when needed for different types of keys.
