The issue in the `_get_with` method seems to be with the conditional checks for the type of `key` and the corresponding function calls. The code seems to be overly complicated and may not be handling each type of `key` correctly.

It seems that the function is trying to handle different data types for the `key` parameter, such as slices, tuples, and different types of indexes.

To fix the issue, we need to simplify the logic and handle each type of `key` in a straightforward and distinct manner. We can use separate if-else conditions for different types of `key` and call the appropriate method for each type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._slice(key)
                else:
                    return self._get_values(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, we have separated out the different types of `key` and handled them directly, calling the appropriate method for each type. This should resolve the bugs and allow the function to handle different types of `key` correctly.
