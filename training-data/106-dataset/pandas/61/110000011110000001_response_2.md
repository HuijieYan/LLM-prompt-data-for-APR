The error message is indicating that the test case is expecting a ValueError to be raised, but it is not being raised. This suggests that the `_get_with` function is not working as expected, leading to the test failure.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of multidimensional keys when indexing. The function should be able to handle multidimensional key indexing, but it's currently failing to do so.

The reason behind the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of multidimensional key indexing. The function might not be equipped to handle such cases correctly, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle multidimensional key indexing. This might involve modifying the conditional statements and logic related to the key type checking and indexing operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        return self._get_values(key)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
                return self._get_values(key[0])
            else:
                raise
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code includes proper handling of different key types and ensures that multidimensional key indexing is handled appropriately, which should resolve the issue and prevent the ValueError from being raised as expected in the test case.
