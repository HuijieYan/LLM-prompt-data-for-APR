The error in the function `_get_with` is likely due to the conditional statements not properly handling certain types of input. The function is intended to return a value based on the type of key provided, but the conditional checks are not comprehensive, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements need to be revised to properly handle various types of input such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, and boolean indexing.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except (ValueError, KeyError):
            return self._get_values(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

In this corrected version, all possible types of `key` are handled properly using `if-elif` conditions, and for any unsupported key types, a `ValueError` is raised to provide a clear error message.
