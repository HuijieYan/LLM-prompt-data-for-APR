Potential error location: The `key` parameter is checked for its type and based on the type, different actions are taken. The code appears to be handling different types of input appropriately, but the handling might be causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, especially with regards to the different types it might have and the subsequent actions taken.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the handling of different types of `key` is appropriate for the expected behavior.
2. Ensure that error messages are informative and helpful for users encountering unexpected input or behavior.
3. Consider refactoring the function to make it more understandable and maintainable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):  # Handle 1-tuple without MultiIndex
                return self._get_values(key[0])
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
