The error message indicates that the `idxr` function is not handling the multidimensional key `nd3` properly and is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

Upon reviewing the code, the function `_get_with(self, key)` is being used by the test function as `idxr` for indexing objects. The issue seems to be related to how this function handles multidimensional keys.

The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling the multidimensional nature of the `nd3` key, causing it to not raise the expected `ValueError` when encountering a multidimensional key.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with(self, key)` needs to be updated to properly handle multidimensional keys, such as `nd3`, by throwing a `ValueError` when such keys are encountered.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            # a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Add handling for multidimensional keys
    if len(np.array(key).shape) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With these changes, the function will now properly handle multidimensional keys and raise a `ValueError` as expected when encountering such keys. This should resolve the bug identified by the test cases.
