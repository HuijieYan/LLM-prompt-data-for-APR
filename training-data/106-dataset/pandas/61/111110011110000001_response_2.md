The error message indicates that the code is failing to raise a ValueError when `idxr[nd3]` is called in the test function. It seems that the test function is expecting an exception to be raised, but the buggy function is not raising it.

Looking at the logic of the `_get_with` function, it seems that the error might be occurring due to incorrect handling of multidimensional key access. The function might not be properly checking for the dimensions of the key being used for indexing.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_get_with` function is not properly handling multidimensional keys. The function should check the dimensions of the key being used for indexing and raise a ValueError if it is not 1-dimensional. This behavior is essential to match the requirements expected by the test function.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to explicitly check the dimensions of the key before proceeding with the indexing operation. If the dimensions are not 1, then a ValueError should be raised. Additionally, the function should undergo rigorous testing with different types of keys and indexing scenarios to ensure its correctness.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) and key.ndim != 1:
        raise ValueError("Index data must be 1-dimensional")
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
            return self.iloc[indexer]
        else:
            return self._get_values(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # TODO: de-dup with tuple case handled above?
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
            # [slice(0, 5, None)] will break if you convert to ndarray,
            # e.g. as requested by np.median
            # FIXME: hack
            return self._get_values(key)

        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the dimensionality of the key used for indexing and raise a ValueError when necessary. This will resolve the issue with the test case failing to raise an exception.
