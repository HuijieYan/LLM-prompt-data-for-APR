The error message indicates that the function is not raising the expected `ValueError` exception when encountering multidimensional key indexing. This suggests there is an issue with the function `_get_with`.

Upon analyzing the code, it's clear that the function `_get_with` is attempting to handle indexing based on the type of key provided. However, the code is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle multi-dimensional key indexing correctly and consistently. This can be achieved by checking the dimensions of the input key and raising a `ValueError` if it is not 1-dimensional.

Here's the corrected code for the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if np.ndim(key) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Index data must be 1-dimensional")

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    # other conditions and handling of different key types go here

    # remaining code as it is
```

By checking the dimensions of the key and ensuring it is 1-dimensional, the function will now raise a `ValueError` as expected when encountering multi-dimensional key indexing.
