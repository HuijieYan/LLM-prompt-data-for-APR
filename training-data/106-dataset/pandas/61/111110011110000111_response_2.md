The error message in the test function indicates that the buggy function `_get_with` is not handling multidimensional keys correctly. The error occurs when the function is indexed with a 3-dimensional array, causing it to fail to raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the part where it attempts to handle a multidimensional key. It seems that the function does not properly handle multi-dimensional keys, leading to the test failures.

The reason for the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not have proper handling for multidimensional keys, leading to unexpected behavior when the function is indexed with a multidimensional array.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to properly handle multidimensional keys. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the dimensions of the key are compatible with the Series or DataFrame being indexed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) and key.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")
    # remaining code for handling other types of keys
```

With this correction, the function will raise a `ValueError` when indexed with a multidimensional key, as expected. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test functions.
