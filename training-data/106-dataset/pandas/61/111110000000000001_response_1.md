The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. 

The issue here is that the function is trying to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.) and is not doing it in a clear and concise way. As a result, the function is becoming convoluted and hard to understand.

To fix this bug, the function needs to have a clearer logic for handling different types of keys. Each type of key should be handled in a separate conditional block, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
