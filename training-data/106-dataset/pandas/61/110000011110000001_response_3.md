The error message from the test function indicates that the `idxr[nd3]` call did not raise a `ValueError` as expected. This suggests that the buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the input `nd3` correctly, resulting in the test failure.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the logic for handling different types of keys is not comprehensive enough. The function contains checks for slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, np.ndarray, Series, and Index types, but it may be missing a specific check for the input `nd3` which is a 3-dimensional numpy array.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when `nd3` is a 3-dimensional numpy array. This could involve adding a specific check for this case and returning an appropriate error or implementing a way to handle 3-dimensional arrays if that is a valid use case for the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim > 2:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    # ... (existing code for other key types)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the function checks if the input key is a numpy array and has more than 2 dimensions. If so, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. This provides a more comprehensive handling of different types of keys and should resolve the issue with the test cases failing.
