In the provided code, the `_get_with` function seems to have issues when processing different types of keys. The function checks the type of the key using `isinstance` and then performs different operations based on the type. However, there are some issues with the way the keys are being processed, resulting in the wrong output.

The possible reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could include incorrect handling of different key types, leading to unexpected behavior. Also, there might be incorrect assumptions about the structure of the input keys.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` can be modified to explicitly handle different key types, ensuring that the appropriate operation is performed on each type of key. This can be achieved by using conditional checks for each key type and then processing the key accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.dtype in ['integer', 'float']:
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
                indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
                return self.iloc[indexer]
            else:
                return self._get_values(key)
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the function appropriately handles different key types and executes the required operation based on the key type. This should address the issues observed in the original `_get_with` function.
