The bug in the function is likely to be caused by the incorrect use of methods such as `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `_get_values`. The function attempts to handle different data types and index types, but it may not handle them correctly.

To fix the bug, the function may need to be updated to properly handle the different data types and index types that are encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
