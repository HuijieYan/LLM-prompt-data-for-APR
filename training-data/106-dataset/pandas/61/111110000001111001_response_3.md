The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing based on the input `key`, including slices, tuples, and various index types. The issue arises when the key is an ndarray, and the function does not handle this case properly, resulting in an error.

The potential error location in the code is when the key is being checked for its type in the if-elif-else ladder. Since the function is unable to handle ndarrays, it leads to an error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle ndarrays in a way that makes sense for the function's purpose. One way to handle ndarrays is to convert them into a format that the function can properly process, such as converting them into lists or other suitable index types.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    # Modify the section below to handle ndarrays
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert the ndarray to a list
        return self.loc[key]
    # End of modification
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
            return self.iloc[indexer]
        else:
            return self._get_values(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
            return self._get_values(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The modifications made to the function involve adding a specific case to handle ndarrays. In this case, ndarrays are converted to lists using the `tolist()` method, and then the `loc` method is used to retrieve the values based on the modified key. This modified approach ensures that ndarrays are properly handled within the function.
