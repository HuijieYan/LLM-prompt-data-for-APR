Based on the provided details and expected values, it seems that the `_get_with` function aims to return values based on different kinds of index inputs. There's a check for the type of the input key, which is a multi-dimensional array in this case.

The potential error lies in how the input key is being processed. It seems that the code attempts to handle different types of index inputs, but it fails to correctly identify the type of the input key and doesn't handle all potential cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be enhanced to handle the different types of index inputs accurately and return the corresponding values. This can be accomplished by explicitly checking the dimensions and types of the input key, and then taking appropriate actions based on the type of index input.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        if key.ndim == 3:
            # Process the key as needed for 3D array input
            result_values = ...  # perform the appropriate operation to get the values
            return result_values
        # Add more condition checks for different dimensions or types of index inputs
    
    # Handle other types of index inputs and return values accordingly
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, the conditional checks are explicitly checking the dimensions and types of the input key, and then processing the key to return the correct values based on the type of index input. This approach ensures that the function accurately handles different kinds of index inputs and returns the expected values.
