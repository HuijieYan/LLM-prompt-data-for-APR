The problematic function `_get_with` is intended to handle indexing operations based on different data types such as slices, DataFrames, and tuples. It seems that the function is not entirely handling all the cases correctly, which is leading to various test failures.

Upon analyzing the test case, it seems that the function is not properly handling multidimensional indexing operations and is not raising the expected `ValueError` when multidimensional indexing is attempted.

The bug appears to be related to the portion of the code that attempts to handle multidimensional keys. The function is not properly identifying multidimensional keys and is not raising the expected `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify multidimensional keys and raise a `ValueError` when such keys are encountered. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for the number of dimensions of the key and raising a `ValueError` if it is greater than one.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    elif key.ndim > 1:  # Check for multidimensional key
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, a new condition `elif key.ndim > 1:` has been added to check for multidimensional keys. If a multidimensional key is detected, a `ValueError` is raised.

Please note that the corrected code assumes the availability of a `.ndim` attribute to identify the number of dimensions in the key. If the exact method for identifying the number of dimensions varies based on the data type of `key`, this part of the code should be adjusted accordingly.
