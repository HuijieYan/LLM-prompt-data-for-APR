The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>` error in the test function. The `_get_with` function appears to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, boolean, etc. The bug might be related to the handling of multidimensional keys, which is the focus of the test function.

The reason behind the bug might be the incorrect handling of multidimensional key indexing, leading to the function failing to raise a `ValueError` when it should. This failure likely causes the test function to fail.

One approach to fixing the bug in the `_get_with` function is to specifically handle the case where the key is multidimensional and raise a `ValueError` in that scenario. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected when encountering multidimensional keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        raise ValueError("Multidimensional keys are not supported")
    # handle other key types here

    # existing code for handling other key types
```

By explicitly raising a `ValueError` for multidimensional keys and handling other key types accordingly, the bug in the function should be fixed, and the test function should pass without the `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>` error.
