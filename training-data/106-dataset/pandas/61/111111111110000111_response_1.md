The error is occurring in the `test_getitem_ndarray_3d` function of the `test_indexing.py` file. This error is happening because the `idxr` function is trying to access a multidimensional array `nd3`, which is not supported.

Looking at the `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file, it seems that the issue is with handling the indexing keys. The function has multiple conditional statements to handle different types of keys, but it lacks proper handling for multidimensional arrays (`ndarray`) like `nd3` used in the test function. 

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle this scenario. One approach to fix the bug is to add a conditional check for multidimensional arrays and raise a ValueError indicating that multidimensional arrays are not supported for indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")
    
    # existing code for handling other types of keys...
```

By adding this conditional check, the function will now raise a `ValueError` when attempting to index with a multidimensional array, preventing the error encountered in the test function.
