Potential error location: The error may be located in the conditional statement that checks if the 'repeats' parameter is a scalar.

Reason for the bug: The current function does not correctly handle the case when 'repeats' is a sequence of integers. It tries to perform operations on the 'repeats' parameter based on whether it is a scalar or a sequence, but the implementation is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use a different approach to handle both scalar and sequence cases for the 'repeats' parameter. This may involve using list comprehensions or a vectorized operation to repeat the strings in the given array.

Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    0    a
    1    b
    2    c
    dtype: object

    Single int repeats string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
    0    aa
    1    bb
    2    cc
    dtype: object

    Sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
    0      a
    1     bb
    2    ccc
    dtype: object
    """
    if np.isscalar(repeats):
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        # Repeat each string based on the corresponding value in the repeats array
        result = arr.apply(lambda x: x * repeats[arr[arr == x].index[0]])
        return result
```
