The bug seems to be related to the use of the `NAType` when calling the `bytes.__mul__` and `str.__mul__` inside the `str_repeat` function. This error is then causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

The issue arises when trying to perform multiplication operations on a `<NA>` value, which is an indicator of missing data in a Series with string dtype. This is because multiplication is not defined for these data types.

One way to fix this bug is to skip the operation for `<NA>` values and return `<NA>` for them. We can do this by using an if condition at the beginning of the `rep` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    0    a
    1    b
    2    c
    dtype: object

    Single int repeats string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
    0    aa
    1    bb
    2    cc
    dtype: object

    Sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
    0      a
    1     bb
    2    ccc
    dtype: object
    """
    
    def rep(x, r):
        if pd.isna(x):
            return pd.NA
        try:
            return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
        except TypeError:
            return str.__mul__(x, r)

    repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
    result = libops.vec_binop(np.asarray(arr), repeats, rep)
    return result
```

In this corrected code, a check for `<NA>` values is added inside the `rep` function. If the value is `<NA>`, the function returns `<NA>` without attempting the multiplication. This should address the issue and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
