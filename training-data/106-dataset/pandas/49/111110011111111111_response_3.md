The error occurs in the `str_repeat` method when handling sequences of repeats. It tries to iterate over the elements of the input array in the `libops.vec_binop` function, but encounters a TypeError when `repeats` contains a None value.

The potential error location is within the `str_repeat` function, specifically in the `rep` function that handles the multiplication of strings.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `rep` function is not handling the None values correctly when trying to perform string multiplication.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `rep` function to handle None values by returning None without attempting string multiplication. Additionally, we need to use a custom function to handle None values instead of relying on the default behavior of the `__mul__` method for strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    if np.isscalar(repeats):
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        def rep(x, r):
            if r is None:
                return None
            else:
                return x * r

        return arr.zip(repeats).map(lambda x, r: rep(x, r))
```

In the corrected code, we handle None values in the `rep` function and use the `map` method to apply the custom function to each pair of elements from the input array and the repeats sequence. This approach allows us to handle None values without encountering TypeErrors.
