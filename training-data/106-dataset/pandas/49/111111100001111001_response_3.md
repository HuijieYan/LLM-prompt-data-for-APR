The bug in the provided function is causing an error because it references a non-existent method `is_scalar()` without properly importing it. Additionally, it also references `np` and `libops`, which are not explicitly defined or imported within the given function. 

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Import the necessary modules and methods such as `numpy` for `np` and `scalar` check method for `is_scalar()` before using them in the function.
2. Ensure that the method `_na_map()` and the internal methods `scalar_rep()` and `rep()` are correctly defined and accessible within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming is_scalar is part of some library, here it is being mocked
def is_scalar(value):
    return True

def _na_map(f, arr, na_result=None, dtype=object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def scalar_rep(x, repeats):
    try:
        return x * repeats
    except TypeError:
        return x * repeats

def rep(x, r):
    try:
        return x * r
    except TypeError:
        return x * r

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    if is_scalar(repeats):
        return _na_map(lambda x: scalar_rep(x, repeats), arr, dtype=str)
    else:
        repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
        result = [rep(x, r) for x, r in zip(arr, repeats)]
        return result
```
