Potential error location: The error might be in the section where the function is trying to handle the case when "repeats" is a scalar value. The function seems to be using the "is_scalar" method which is not a standard Python function.

Reason behind the bug: The "is_scalar" method is not a standard Python function, so it is causing the error. It seems like the intention of this check is to determine whether the "repeats" parameter is a scalar or a sequence of values, but the approach used here is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using "is_scalar", we can use a different approach to determine whether the "repeats" parameter is a scalar or a sequence of values. One way to approach this is to use Python's built-in "isinstance" function to check if "repeats" is of type int or a sequence type (such as list or numpy array).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    0    a
    1    b
    2    c
    dtype: object

    Single int repeats string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
    0    aa
    1    bb
    2    cc
    dtype: object

    Sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
    0      a
    1     bb
    2    ccc
    dtype: object
    """
    if isinstance(repeats, int):  # check if repeats is a scalar
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
```
