Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the two nested functions, `scalar_rep` and `rep`, where a TypeError is being handled by either returning `bytes.__mul__(x, r)` or `str.__mul__(x, r)`.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `__mul__` method on the `bytes` or `str` objects. The `__mul__` method is used for multiplication, but it is being used for string repetition, which is causing the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using the `__mul__` method, the `str` or `bytes` objects should be multiplied directly by the `repeats` value to achieve the desired string repetition.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar

# this is the corrected function
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    0    a
    1    b
    2    c
    dtype: object

    Single int repeats string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
    0    aa
    1    bb
    2    cc
    dtype: object

    Sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
    0      a
    1     bb
    2    ccc
    dtype: object
    """
    if is_scalar(repeats):
        return arr * repeats
    else:
        repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
        result = np.multiply.outer(arr, repeats).ravel()
        return result
