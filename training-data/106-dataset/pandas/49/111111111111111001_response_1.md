The error occurs inside the `str_repeat` function due to the fact that it is calling a helper function `rep` which multiplies strings by a scalar value. However, it does not handle the case when the input contains NA (Not Available) values. This is evident from the error message which states that `Type Error` occurred while multiplying a 'NAType' with an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the input value is NA. One possible approach is to use pandas' `str.repeat` method directly, which already handles the NA values properly. We can modify the `str_repeat` function to use `str.repeat` method for non-scalar input values.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
   """
    return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
```

By using the `str.repeat` method directly, we can avoid the error caused by handling NA values explicitly. This will simplify the function and make it more robust.
