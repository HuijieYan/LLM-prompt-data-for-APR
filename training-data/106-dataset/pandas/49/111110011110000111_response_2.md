The error message is related to the `str_repeat` method, which is called by the `test_repeat_with_null` test case. The error occurs when attempting to repeat a sequence of strings, one of which is a `NAType`, causing a TypeError.

The bug is located in the implementation of the `str_repeat` function, specifically in the `rep` function where it tries to repeat the strings using the `__mul__` method from the `bytes` and `str` classes. This causes a TypeError when dealing with `NAType` (a missing value) as it is not compatible with these operations.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not handle missing values properly when repeating a sequence of strings. It tries to use the `__mul__` method from `bytes` and `str` classes regardless of the type of the input.

To fix the bug, the `str_repeat` function needs to be updated to handle missing values properly when repeating a sequence of strings. It should check for missing values and avoid using the `__mul__` method from `bytes` and `str` classes when encountering missing values.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    0    a
    1    b
    2    c
    dtype: object

    Single int repeats string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
    0    aa
    1    bb
    2    cc
    dtype: object

    Sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series

    >>> s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
    0      a
    1     bb
    2    ccc
    dtype: object
    """
    if pd.api.types.is_scalar(repeats):
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)

    result = arr.copy()
    for i, repeat in enumerate(repeats):
        if repeat is not None:
            result[i] = result[i] * repeat
    return result
```

In this corrected implementation, we first check if the `repeats` parameter is scalar. If it's scalar, we use the built-in `str.repeat` method provided by pandas. If not, we iterate through the sequence of `repeats` and multiply the strings by the corresponding repeat value, avoiding the use of `__mul__` from `bytes` and `str` classes when encountering `NAType` (missing values). This should fix the bug and handle missing values properly when repeating a sequence of strings.
