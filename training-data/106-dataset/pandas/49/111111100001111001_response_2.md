The issue appears to be with the `str_repeat` function. The problem arises from the fact that the code checks if `repeats` is a scalar or not. If it's a scalar, it uses a local function `scalar_rep` to apply a multiplication operation, and if it's not a scalar, it uses a local function `rep` to do a vectorized operation. However, the `scalar_rep` and `rep` functions are not defined properly and the logic inside them seems to be incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the `scalar_rep` and `rep` functions are not properly defined, and even if they were, the logic inside them seems to be incorrect.

To fix the issue, we can directly use the `rep` function to handle both scalar and non-scalar cases. If `repeats` is a scalar, we will convert it to an array and then use the `rep` function to handle both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import lib

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    def rep(x, r):
        try:
            return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
        except TypeError:
            return str.__mul__(x, r)

    repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
    result = lib.map_infer(arr, lambda x: rep(x, repeats))
    return result

# Test Cases
s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
print(s)
s1 = s.str.repeat(repeats=2)
print(s1)
s2 = s.str.repeat(repeats=[1, 2, 3])
print(s2)
```
