Potential error location: The issue seems to be with how the function is handling the repeats parameter, as it should be either a single int or a sequence of ints, but the way it is being processed is causing the bug.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the repeats parameter. The function should be able to handle both a single int and a sequence of ints, but the current implementation is not doing that effectively.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if repeats is a scalar or a sequence and handle it accordingly.
2. Use a conditional statement to differentiate between a single int and a sequence of ints.
3. Use the np.repeat function to handle the repetition of strings based on the repeats parameter.

# Corrected code
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    if isinstance(repeats, int):
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats=repeats)
```
