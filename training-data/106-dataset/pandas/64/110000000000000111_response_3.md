The issue appears to be with the `__init__` method, which is the constructor method for a class. The problem seems to be related to the functionality of specifying column names to output to Excel. The bug causes the method to output all columns in the dataframe, regardless of the specified column names.

The potential error location in the `__init__` method is where it checks for the presence of specified columns in the dataframe and raises KeyError if the specified columns are not found. This logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the incorrect output.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect logic in the section where it checks for specified columns in the dataframe. It appears that the condition checking for the presence of columns in the dataframe may not be accurate, leading to an incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the presence of specified columns in the dataframe needs to be revised. Additionally, the code where it sets `self.df = df` appears to be redundant and may need review.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
            raise KeyError("Specified columns not found in the dataframe")

    self.columns = cols if cols is not None else self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
