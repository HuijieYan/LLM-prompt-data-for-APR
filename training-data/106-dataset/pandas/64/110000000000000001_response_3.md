The potential error in the code is that the 'self.df' attribute is being reassigned within the conditional block, which means that the initial assignment of 'self.df = df' is redundant.

The bug occurs because the 'self.df' attribute is being reassigned in the conditional block, which means that the initial assignment of 'self.df = df' is redundant. Additionally, the conditional check for the presence of all specified columns in the dataframe using the intersection operator '&' is not necessary and can be simplified.

To fix the bug, we can remove the redundant assignment of 'self.df = df' within the conditional block and simplify the conditional check for the presence of all specified columns in the dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable

class ClassName:
    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
                raise KeyError("Not all specified columns are found in the dataframe")

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
