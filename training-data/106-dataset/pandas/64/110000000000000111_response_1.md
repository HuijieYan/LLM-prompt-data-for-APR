The issue seems to be related to the `to_excel` function in Pandas 1.0.0. The user is expecting that only the specified columns (`['col_a', 'col_b']`) should be written to the excel file, but all columns are being written instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if cols is not None` block. It seems like the logic to check and write only the specified columns is not working as expected.

The reason behind the bug could be a problem with the condition check and assignment of `self.df` within the `if cols is not None` block. It seems like the logic to select and assign only the specified columns is not correctly implemented.

One possible approach to fix the bug could be to modify the logic within the `if cols is not None` block to correctly select and assign only the specified columns to `self.df`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    
    if cols is not None:
        # Select only the specified columns
        selected_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col in cols]
        self.df = df[selected_cols]
    else:
        self.df = df
    
    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, the logic within the `if cols is not None` block has been modified to correctly select and assign only the specified columns to `self.df`. This should address the issue where all columns were being written to the excel file instead of just the specified columns.
