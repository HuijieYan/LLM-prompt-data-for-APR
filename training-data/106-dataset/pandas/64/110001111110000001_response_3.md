The bug seems to be present in the `to_excel` function, which writes a DataFrame to an Excel file. The error message indicates a mismatch in the shape of the expected and read frames.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug might be related to the logic for writing a subset of columns to the Excel file. The `columns` parameter is used to specify the subset of columns to be written. However, the bug may be causing an incorrect subset of columns to be read back from the Excel file, leading to a shape mismatch.

The DataFrame `write_frame` is created with three columns ("A", "B", "C"), but only columns "A" and "B" are specified for writing to the Excel file. Then, when reading the file back, it may be trying to read all three columns rather than just "A" and "B", leading to the shape mismatch.

To fix the bug, the `columns` parameter should be taken into consideration when reading the Excel file back. The read operation should only consider the specified subset of columns.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:

        # all missing, raise
        if not set(cols).issubset(df.columns):
            raise KeyError("passed columns are not ALL present in the dataframe")

        self.df = df[cols]  # Subset the DataFrame with specified columns

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The provided correction handles the subset of columns correctly while reading the Excel file back, ensuring that only the specified subset of columns is considered, fixing the shape mismatch issue.
