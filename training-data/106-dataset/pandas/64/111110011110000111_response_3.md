The buggy code is a class method within the `ExcelFormatter` class. The method is meant to format a DataFrame to a list of ExcelCells, but it seems to have issues in handling the columns parameter, which is leading to unexpected behavior in the test cases.

The potential error location within the method is the handling of the `cols` parameter. It attempts to filter the DataFrame based on the specified columns but does not work as intended, as it leads to unexpected output in the test cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of the `cols` parameter. The code is attempting to filter the DataFrame using the specified columns, but it does not do so correctly, resulting in all columns being included in the output.

To fix the bug, the method should correctly handle the `cols` parameter and filter the DataFrame based on the specified columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable, List

class ExcelFormatter():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,  # corrected type for cols parameter
        header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,  # corrected type for index_label parameter
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):  # check if all specified columns are present
                raise KeyError("Specified columns are not all present in the DataFrame")
            self.df = df[cols]  # filter the DataFrame based on specified columns

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected function includes the following changes:
1. Updated the type of `cols` parameter to `Optional[Sequence[str]]` to ensure it accepts a sequence of column names.
2. Updated the type of `index_label` parameter to `Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]]` to allow for a single string or a sequence of strings.
3. Properly filtered the DataFrame based on the specified columns in the `cols` parameter. The corrected approach ensures that only the specified columns are included in the output.

By applying these changes, the function should now correctly handle the `cols` parameter and filter the DataFrame based on the specified columns, addressing the bug.
