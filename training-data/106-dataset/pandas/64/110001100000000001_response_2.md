The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checking for the presence of all columns in the dataframe. There is a mismatch in the logic of the condition which is causing the KeyError to be raised incorrectly.

The bug is occurring because the condition checking the presence of all columns in the dataframe is not written correctly. It is causing the KeyError to be raised inappropriately, even when all the specified columns are present in the dataframe.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to re-write the condition checking for the presence of all columns in the dataframe. This condition should accurately check for the presence of all specified columns in the dataframe and handle the situation accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable

class ClassName:
    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            if not set(cols).issubset(set(df.columns)):
                raise KeyError("Specified columns are not all present in the dataframe")
        
        self.columns = list(self.df.columns)
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
