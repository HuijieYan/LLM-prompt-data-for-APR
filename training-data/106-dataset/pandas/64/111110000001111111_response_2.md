The issue seems to be related to the specification of column names to be written to Excel, which is not working as expected in pandas 1.0.0.

The potential error location is the `__init__` method within the `ExcelFormatter` class, where the columns specified for writing are not being properly handled.

The bug is likely occurring because the code is not correctly checking and processing the specified columns to be written to the Excel file. This is leading to all columns in the DataFrame being written instead of the specified columns.

To fix the bug, the code within the `__init__` method should be modified to properly handle the specified columns for writing to Excel. This can be done by checking if the specified columns are present in the DataFrame and only writing those columns.

Below is the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        if cols is not None:
            df = df[cols]
        self.df = df
        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the specified columns for writing to Excel and only write those specified columns.
