The problematic function is actually the `__init__` method of a class, which seems to be related to reading and writing Excel files using the Pandas library.

The error message from the test function indicates a DataFrame shape mismatch, specifically stating that the expected shape is (3, 2) while the actual shape is (3, 3).

The potential error location within the `__init__` method is the section where the columns are being set based on the provided DataFrame. There might be an issue with handling the columns when setting up the object, which is leading to this shape mismatch error.

The bug is likely occurring because the columns are being set incorrectly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual shapes of the DataFrame.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the columns are correctly handled when setting up the object. This may involve reviewing the logic for setting the columns and correcting any mistakes in the logic.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the class:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    if cols is not None:
        cols_exist_in_df = set(cols).issubset(df.columns)
        if not cols_exist_in_df:
            raise KeyError("All passed columns are not present in the dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]
    else:
        self.df = df

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that all the passed columns are present in the DataFrame before setting `self.df` to the subset of columns. This should address the mismatch error and improve the functionality of the `__init__` method.
