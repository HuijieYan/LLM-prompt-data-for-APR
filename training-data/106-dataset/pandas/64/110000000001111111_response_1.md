The issue is likely occurring in the conditional check for 'cols' not being None. If 'cols' is specified, the intention is to check if all the specified columns are present in the dataframe and then update the 'self.df' variable accordingly. However, the current implementation is incorrect and does not achieve this intended behavior.

The potential bug in the code is that the check `if cols is not None:` is missing before performing the subsequent checks related to 'cols'.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if 'cols' is not None before performing any operations related to 'cols'.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not set(cols).issubset(df.columns):
            raise KeyError("Specified columns are not all present in the dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected code adds the necessary conditional check to verify if 'cols' is not None before proceeding with the operations related to 'cols'. If 'cols' is not None, it then checks if all the specified columns are present in the dataframe and updates 'self.df' accordingly.
