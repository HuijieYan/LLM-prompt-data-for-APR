The error in the code seems to occur when trying to write a subset of columns to an Excel file using the `to_excel` method. The error message indicates a shape mismatch in the DataFrames, suggesting that all columns are being written to the Excel file instead of just the specified subset.

The issue seems to originate from the `__init__` function of the `ExcelFormatter` class. Specifically, the condition for handling the `cols` parameter is causing the bug. The intention of this condition is to check and enforce that only the specified columns are present in the DataFrame before writing to the Excel file. However, the condition logic is incorrect and is leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition for handling the `cols` parameter needs to be revised. Additionally, it's important to validate against the subset of columns specified and only write those columns to the Excel file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            # Validate against the subset of columns specified
            if not set(cols).issubset(df.columns):
                raise KeyError("Specified columns are not all present in the dataframe")
            # Use only the subset of columns for writing to the Excel file
            self.df = df[cols]

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, the `cols` parameter is validated against the subset of columns present in the DataFrame, and only the subset of columns specified will be used for writing to the Excel file. This should address the issue of writing all columns to the Excel file instead of the specified subset.
