The `__init__` method for the `ExcelFormatter` class appears to be designed to initialize various attributes of the class instance based on the provided parameters. However, there are potential issues in the method that may lead to it not working as intended.

The input parameter `cols` is being checked against the presence of columns in the dataframe, but the logic seems to be incorrect. Additionally, the `self.df` attribute is reassigned based on the columns, which can lead to inconsistencies in the logic. The conditional behavior when `cols` is not `None` does not seem to be correctly implemented.

The conditional logic related to processing `cols` and checking its presence in the dataframe should be thoroughly reviewed and modified to ensure that the correct behavior is achieved.

A potential fix for these issues might involve iterating over the provided `cols` and checking for their presence in the dataframe. This can ensure that columns are correctly matched and that the attributes of the class instance are updated accordingly.

The corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `ExcelFormatter` class is as follows:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        missing_cols = [col for col in cols if col not in df.columns]
        if missing_cols:
            raise KeyError(f"The following columns are missing in the dataframe: {missing_cols}")

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
Note: The corrected code may need to be further adapted and tested based on the broader context of the class and its usage.
