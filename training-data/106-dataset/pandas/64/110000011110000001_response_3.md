The error occurs when the `test_write_subset_columns` function is called. This function is responsible for writing a DataFrame to an Excel file and then reading it back, after which it checks if the original and the read DataFrame are equal. The error message indicates that the shapes of the DataFrames are different.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the bug is in the `__init__` method of the class that should handle Excel writing. The main issue is with handling the specified columns.

The bug occurs because the initial dataframe is being reassigned to `self.df` twice, with the second reassignment effectively undoing the filtering done by selecting specific columns. This causes a mismatch in the shape of the dataframes when reading back the excel file.

To fix this issue, it's important to ensure that the columns list is properly applied to the dataframe when writing to the Excel file so that only the selected columns are included.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    if cols is not None:
        self.df = df[cols]  # filter the dataframe using the specified columns
    else:
        self.df = df

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, when the `cols` parameter is provided, it filters the dataframe `df` using the specified columns before assigning it to `self.df`. This ensures that only the selected columns are included in the dataframe.
