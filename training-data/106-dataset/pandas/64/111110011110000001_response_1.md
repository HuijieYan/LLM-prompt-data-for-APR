The error message from the test function indicates that there is a mismatch in the shape of the DataFrames. The expected DataFrame has shape (3, 2) while the read DataFrame has shape (3, 3).

Upon analyzing the provided function `ExcelFormatter.__init__`, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of column subsets. The code tries to handle missing or incorrectly specified columns, but this logic might be causing the mismatch in DataFrame shapes.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling column subsets needs to be reviewed. It's possible that the condition for checking the presence of columns in the DataFrame is causing issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `ExcelFormatter.__init__` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
import pandas as pd
import pytest
import pandas._testing as tm
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable

class ExcelFormatter():
    # ... (other code)

    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None

        self.df = df
        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The above code should address the issues related to column handling and should prevent the shape mismatch error observed in the test function.
