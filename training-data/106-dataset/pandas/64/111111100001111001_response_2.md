The `__init__` method in the `ExcelFormatter` class is currently checking if the columns specified in the `cols` parameter are present in the DataFrame. If not, it raises a KeyError or enforces a key error. However, it is also reassigning `self.df` to `df` which means that any changes to the DataFrame in the conditional block will not affect the main DataFrame being processed.

This results in the incorrect functioning of the function because, for all the input cases, the DataFrame that is later used is assigned incorrectly or multiple times, leading to an unsatisfactory outcome.

To fix this, we can remove the reassignment of `self.df = df` in the conditional block and remove the unnecessary condition checking. By doing this, unnecessary reassignments are avoided, and updates to the DataFrame will be directly applied to the main DataFrame being processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
        df = df.data
    
    self.df = df
    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
With these changes, the function should now work correctly for the given test cases.
