The error occurs when trying to calculate the `value_counts` of an empty Series with dtype `'Int64'`. This leads to a ValueError related to a reduction operation on a zero-size array.

The potential error location within the `IntegerArray` class is the `_values_for_argsort` method. Specifically, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` appears to be problematic as it tries to perform an operation on an empty array.

The bug occurs because the `_values_for_argsort` method does not handle the case of an empty array properly. When the input data is empty, attempting to find the minimum value of the array and subtracting 1 from it results in a ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to handle the case when the input array is empty. If the array is empty, we can return an empty array or return an appropriate default value without performing any operations.

Here's the corrected `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```
