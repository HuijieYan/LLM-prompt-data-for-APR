Potential Error Location: The potential error is occurring at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` where we are trying to assign a new value to the masked elements of the data array.

Reason for Bug: The bug is occurring because the function is trying to modify the original data array directly without creating a copy. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, we need to create a copy of the data array and then modify the copy instead of the original array. This will ensure that the original array remains unchanged.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
