The buggy function is causing an error when the `value_counts` method is called on a Series with empty values of dtype "Int64". The error occurs at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` inside the `_values_for_argsort` method.

The error is caused because `data` is an empty array, and when trying to find the minimum value using `data.min()`, it results in a ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `data` is not empty before attempting to find the minimum value and modify the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```
