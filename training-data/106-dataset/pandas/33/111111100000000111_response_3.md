The bug seems to be occurring in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. The bug is likely to be caused by the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`, which is trying to update the values based on the mask, but it seems to be causing issues when trying to compute the minimum of an empty array in the context of `value_counts()`.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_values_for_argsort` method to handle the case when the array is empty or when all values are missing. We can modify the function to return an empty array when there are no valid values in the array.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Return values for sorting.

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray
            The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
            within the array.

        See Also
        --------
        ExtensionArray.argsort
        """
        if np.all(self._mask):
            return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)  # Return an empty array if all values are missing
        else:
            data = self._data.copy()
            data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
            return data
```
This modification checks if all values are missing and returns an empty array of the appropriate dtype in that case. This should handle the issue observed in the test case.
