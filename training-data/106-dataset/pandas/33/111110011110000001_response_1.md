The error message occurs when trying to get the value counts of an empty Series with integer dtype. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError due to a zero-size array being passed to a reduction operation minimum which has no identity.

The potential error location is within the `_values_for_argsort` function, specifically at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line is trying to access an empty array `data` (due to the empty Series) and perform a reduction operation, which results in the ValueError.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_values_for_argsort` function does not handle the case of an empty array when applying the min operation. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case of an empty array before performing the min operation. If the array is empty, we can return an empty array without performing the min operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```
