The error message indicates a ValueError related to a reduction operation on a zero-size array. This suggests that the bug is likely in the `_values_for_argsort` function, specifically at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`, where it seems to be attempting a reduction operation on a zero-size array.

The bug occurs because when the `_mask` is empty (indicating there are no elements to mask), the operation `data[self._mask]` results in a zero-size array. Then when trying to perform the reduction operation `data.min()` on this zero-size array, it causes a ValueError.

To fix this bug, a check should be added to ensure that the `_mask` is not empty before performing the masking operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
