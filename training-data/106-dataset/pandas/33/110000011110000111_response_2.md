The error message is related to the `value_counts` method being called on an empty Series with dtype "Int64". The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method, specifically at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. The error message indicates a ValueError due to a zero-size array being passed to the `umr_minimum` function.

The issue occurs because when the input array is empty, `data.min()` returns `nan`, and subtracting 1 from it results in `nan` as well. This is causing the ValueError when trying to find the minimum of an empty array. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if the array is empty before attempting to find the minimum and subtracting 1 from it. If the array is empty, we should return an empty array without performing any operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:  # Check if the array is empty
        return np.array([])  # Return an empty array
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With this fix, the function will now return an empty array if the input data is empty, preventing the ValueError from occurring when attempting to find the minimum of the empty array.
