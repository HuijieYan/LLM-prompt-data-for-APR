The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. When attempting to perform the operation `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`, the error `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity` is raised. This error occurs because when the array `data` is empty (`array([], dtype=int64)`), taking the minimum of an empty array does not have a well-defined behavior because there is no "smallest" value.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the array `data` is empty separately, before trying to assign the minimum value minus 1 to elements indicated by the mask.

Here's the corrected function for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data  # If the data is empty, return it as is
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With this updated code, when the `data` array is empty, the function will return the empty array without trying to compute the minimum value, thus avoiding the error.
