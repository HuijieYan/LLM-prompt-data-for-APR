The error message indicates that there is an issue with the minimum operation (`data.min()`) in the `_values_for_argsort` method. This error occurs when trying to compute the minimum of an empty array.

It seems that the `self._data` is an empty array and when trying to set values at the indices specified by `self._mask`, it encounters a computation issue because the `self._data` array is empty.

To fix this issue, a check for the empty array should be added before performing the minimum operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        return self._data  # Return the empty array
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
