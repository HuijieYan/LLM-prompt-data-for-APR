The error occurs during the execution of the `value_counts()` method on a Series of dtype 'Int64'. The error message indicates a ValueError related to a zero-size array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_values_for_argsort()` method, specifically the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line is causing the ValueError related to a zero-size array because `data` is an empty array.

The bug occurs because, when the input `data` is an empty array, the result of `data.min()` is undefined. Therefore, trying to subtract 1 from this undefined result causes the ValueError.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the input `data` is empty before performing the operation. If it is empty, simply return the empty array without any modifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort()` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
```
