The error occurs because the `min` method is being called on an empty array in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This causes a ValueError when trying to perform the reduction operation on an empty array.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `data` array is not empty before trying to perform any operations on it. We can also change the return type annotation from `np.ndarray` to `Union[np.ndarray, Any]` to indicate that the return type could also be `Any` if the array is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Union

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> Union[np.ndarray, Any]:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    Union[np.ndarray, Any]
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With these changes, the function will now return the input `self._data` if it is empty, and perform the operation on `data` only if it is not empty, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
