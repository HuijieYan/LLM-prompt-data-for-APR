The test function `test_value_counts_empty` is trying to create a Series with an empty array and then call the `value_counts` method on the Series. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `argsort` method being called within the `value_counts` method.

The potential error location within the `_values_for_argsort` method is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the input array is empty, calling `data.min()` on an empty array returns `np.nan`. Then, trying to subtract 1 from `np.nan` results in the ValueError: "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity".

To fix this bug, it's necessary to check whether the array is empty before attempting to find the minimum value. If the array is not empty, then the minimum value can be obtained and used for further operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
```
