Potential error location: 

The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is attempting to assign a value to `data` based on a Boolean mask. It seems to be attempting to fill in the missing values with the minimum value in the data array minus 1.

Reasons behind the bug:

1. The `data.min() - 1` is not an appropriate value to fill in for missing data. It might not accurately represent the true missing values in the array.
2. Modifying the `data` array directly might not be the best approach, as it could lead to unexpected behavior when manipulating the array later on.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Instead of using `data.min() - 1` to fill in missing values, use a value that clearly represents missing or unknown data, such as numpy's `np.nan`.
2. Consider creating a new array to represent the transformed values, rather than directly modifying the original data array and using a mask for this purpose.

Corrected code:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
