The error occurs when the `data` variable in the `_values_for_argsort` function is an empty array and the `_mask` is also an empty array. Then, we try to perform an operation `data[self._mask]`, which results in a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_values_for_argsort` function to check if the array is empty before trying to perform the operation `data[self._mask]`. If the array is empty, we can return an empty array directly.

Also, since the function uses numpy (`np.ndarray`), we need to import the numpy library at the start of the file.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0 or len(self._mask) == 0:
        return np.array([])  # Return an empty array if either data or mask is empty

    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding a check for empty arrays at the start of the function, we can prevent the ValueError from occurring.
