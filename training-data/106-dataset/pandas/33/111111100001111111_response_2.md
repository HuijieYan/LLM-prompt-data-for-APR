The bug seems to be occurring inside the `_values_for_argsort` function. This function is intended to return values for sorting, maintaining the ordering between values within the array. 

The error message "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction" suggests that there is an issue with performing a reduction operation on a zero-sized array.

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be with the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. It appears that the code is trying to modify the `data` array based on the `_mask`, and the error might be occurring when the `_mask` array is empty.

To fix this bug, you can add a condition to check if the `_mask` array is empty. If it is not empty, then perform the operation, otherwise return the `data` array as is.

Below is the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(self._mask) > 0:  # Check if _mask array is not empty
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding the condition to check if the `_mask` array is not empty before performing the operation, the bug causing the "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction" should be fixed.
