The bug seems to be in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. The function is trying to assign a value to `data` based on the condition of `self._mask`, and it's likely causing issues when the arrays have different lengths.

To fix the bug and prevent this error, we can modify the function to use numpy's boolean indexing which is based on the boolean condition of `self._mask`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = np.nan  # Replace with NaN for missing values
    return data
```

In this correction, we use `np.nan` to represent missing values and update the `data` array using boolean indexing with `self._mask`. This will ensure that the arrays remain aligned and the potential issue of different lengths causing an error is avoided.
