The given test case involves a call to the `value_counts()` method on an empty Series with `dtype='Int64'`. This call raises a ValueError due to a zero-size array to reduction error.

The potential error location within the `IntegerArray` class is the `_values_for_argsort` method. The method tries to create a copy of the `_data` attribute and then assigns the minimum value of the data - 1 to the elements where the `_mask` is True. This could lead to issues when the `_data` array is empty, which is the case in the provided test scenario.

The bug occurs because the `_values_for_argsort` method does not handle the case of an empty `_data` array properly. When the `_data` array is empty, the operation `data.min() - 1` leads to an empty array of type `ndarray`, which causes the error.

To fix the bug, the `_values_for_argsort` method needs to handle the case of an empty `_data` array explicitly by returning an empty array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

The revised code first checks if the `_data` array is empty. If it is, the method returns an empty array of the same dtype as `_data`. Otherwise, it performs the transformation as before. This change ensures that the method handles the case of an empty `_data` array properly and prevents the error from occurring.
