The buggy function `_values_for_argsort` is trying to return the `data` array, which is a copy of `self._data`. It then tries to replace the elements where `self._mask` is True with the minimum value of `data` minus 1. However, this logic is flawed because it is not handling the case where `self._data` is an empty array and therefore has no minimum value. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self._data` is empty and return an empty array in that case. Otherwise, we can proceed with replacing the masked values as before.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```
