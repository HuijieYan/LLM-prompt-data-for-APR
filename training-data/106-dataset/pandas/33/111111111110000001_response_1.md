The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` due to a zero-size array being used in a reduction operation. The problematic function that leads to this error is `_values_for_argsort` in the `IntegerArray` class.

The reason behind this bug is that when the mask contains `True` (indicating missing values), the minimum value of the data array is used for those positions. If the entire data array is filled with missing values (i.e., the mask is all `True`), then the minimum operation results in a zero-size array, leading to the `ValueError` when using it in the reduction operation.

To fix this bug, the function `_values_for_argsort` needs to be modified to handle the case where the entire data array is comprised of missing values. One approach is to add a check at the beginning of the function to handle this scenario without performing the minimum operation if all values are missing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if self._mask.all():
        return data  # If all values are missing, return the unmodified data
    
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding the check `if self._mask.all(): return data` at the beginning of the function, the code will return the unmodified data array if all values are missing, avoiding the zero-size array issue and the associated `ValueError`.
