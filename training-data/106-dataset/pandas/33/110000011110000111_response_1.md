The error message indicates that a ValueError is raised due to a zero-size array being passed to the reduction operation minimum, which has no identity.

Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `pandas.core.arrays.integer` module. Specifically, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` raises the ValueError when `data` is a zero-size array.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_values_for_argsort` method is trying to modify the `data` array by setting values where `self._mask` is True to `data.min() - 1`. However, if `data` is a zero-size array, then calling `data.min()` would raise the ValueError because a zero-sized array does not have a minimum value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, you can check if the `data` array is empty before trying to manipulate it. If it's empty, then simply return an empty array.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

# corrected function
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
