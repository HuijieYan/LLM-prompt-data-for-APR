The error occurs when trying to find the minimum value from an empty array, which results in a ValueError: "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity". This demonstrates that the function is not handling the case of an empty array properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _values_for_argsort function to handle the case of an empty array. We should check if the array is empty and return an empty array without performing any operations in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:  # Adding a check for an empty array
        return self._data  # Return an empty array without any operations
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case of an empty array without causing a ValueError.
