Potential Error Location:
The error is likely in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. It seems that the intention is to replace the masked values with a value that is lower than the minimum value in the data array, but this approach is not implemented correctly.


Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code tries to assign a single value to multiple elements of the array data using the boolean mask self._mask, but this approach is not correct.


Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The correct approach would be to use numpy masked arrays or boolean indexing to replace the masked values with the desired value.


Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
