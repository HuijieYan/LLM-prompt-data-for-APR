The error message indicates that there is a ValueError when trying to perform a reduction operation on a zero-size array, specifically when trying to find the minimum value. The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` function.

The reason behind the bug is that when `data` is an empty array and `_mask` is also empty, the statement `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` will attempt to find the minimum value of an empty array, which raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `data` array is non-empty before attempting to find the minimum value and perform the assignment according to this condition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(data) > 0:  # Check if data is non-empty
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

This modification ensures that the minimum value is only calculated and used for assignment when `data` contains elements, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
