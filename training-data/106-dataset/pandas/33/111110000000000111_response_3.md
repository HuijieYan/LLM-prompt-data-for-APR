The error message "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction" suggests that there is an issue with performing a reduction operation on an empty array of type Int64.

The potential error location within the provided function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. If the `mask` array is empty, this line of code will cause an error when trying to perform a reduction operation on an empty array.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the `mask` array is empty, and it tries to perform an operation on the empty array, leading to the "zero-size array to reduction" error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `mask` array is empty before performing any operations on it. If the `mask` array is empty, we should return the `data` array as is without applying any transformations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
