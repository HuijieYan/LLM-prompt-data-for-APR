Potential error location: 
The potential error in the provided function is with the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. The intention seems to be to mask out certain elements in the `data` array, but it is currently not implemented correctly. 

Reason behind the bug:
The error occurs because the `self._mask` is intended to be a boolean mask that selects certain elements in the `data` array, but the code does not perform this operation effectively.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to use boolean indexing to mask out the elements in the `data` array based on `self._mask`.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
