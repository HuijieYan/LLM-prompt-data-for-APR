The error message is indicating a ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity. This means that the function _values_for_argsort is encountering an issue with attempting to find the minimum value in an empty array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the line:

```python
data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
```

This line is attempting to find the minimum value in the array 'data', and due to the fact that 'data' is an empty array, this is causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, a check needs to be implemented to handle the case of an empty array. One possible approach is to return an empty array if the input array is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the _values_for_argsort function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([])
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

This modification adds a check for an empty array. If the input array is empty, the function returns an empty array. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic.
