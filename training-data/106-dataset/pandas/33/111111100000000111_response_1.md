Potential error location: The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is causing the error. When the data array is empty, the `data.min()` returns NaN, and subtracting 1 from NaN results in another NaN, causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of an empty data array, leading to a NaN value being assigned to the empty array, which is not allowed and results in a ValueError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the data array is empty before attempting to perform any operations on it.
2. If the data array is empty, return an empty array directly without attempting any operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([])
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the data array is empty. If it is, we return an empty array directly. If not, we perform the necessary operations on the data array.
