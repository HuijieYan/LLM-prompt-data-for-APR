The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. It seems that when the `data` array is empty, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` results in a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`. This indicates that the minimum value cannot be calculated for an empty array.

To fix this issue, we can add a check for the length of the `data` array before performing the computation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(data) > 0:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding the check `if len(data) > 0:`, we ensure that the operation of calculating `data.min() - 1` is only performed when the `data` array is not empty. This should resolve the `ValueError` that occurred when the `data` array was empty.
