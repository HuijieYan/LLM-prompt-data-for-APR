Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. It seems like the intention is to treat missing values in the data as the minimum value in the array minus 1. However, this operation may cause unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with an empty array or a zero-size array.

Reasons Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the handling of missing values in the array. When the array is empty or of zero size, the operation `data.min() - 1` may result in unexpected behavior or raise an error, as observed in the GitHub issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case of empty or zero-size array separately, and avoid the operation that leads to the error. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to handle such cases.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if len(data) == 0:  # Handling empty array
        return data
    else:
        min_val = data.min()
        if min_val == np.nan:  # Handling the case where data only contains missing values
            return data
        else:
            data[self._mask] = min_val - 1
            return data
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the array is empty, and if so, we return the array as it is. We also handle the case where the entire array contains missing values. If the array is not empty and contains non-missing values, we then perform the operation to handle missing values as intended. This approach addresses the potential bug and ensures that the function handles empty arrays and arrays with missing values appropriately.
