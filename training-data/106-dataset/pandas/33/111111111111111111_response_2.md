Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` function of the `IntegerArray` class. Specifically, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is causing a `ValueError` due to an attempt to perform a reduction operation on a zero-size array.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_values_for_argsort` function is attempting to perform a reduction operation on the `data` array, which is empty, and this is causing the `ValueError`. It seems that the operation is trying to find the minimum value in an empty array, causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the empty array condition and handle it appropriately to avoid the reduction operation on an empty array.
2. Add a check before performing the reduction operation to ensure that the array is not empty and handle it gracefully if it is.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
