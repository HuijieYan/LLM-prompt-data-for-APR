Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`, where the intention is to replace masked values with the minimum value in the array minus 1.

Reasons for the bug:
1. It is not clear what `self._mask` represents. It seems like it might be a boolean mask indicating which elements of the array should be replaced, but this is not explicitly stated.
2. There is a potential issue with data types if `self._data` is not a numpy array.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that `self._mask` is appropriately defined and matches the shape of `self._data` to avoid any indexing issues.
2. Confirm the data types of `self._data` and ensure that the calculations are performed with appropriate data types.
3. Consider handling any potential edge cases, such as when `self._data` is empty or does not contain any valid values.

Corrected code:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
