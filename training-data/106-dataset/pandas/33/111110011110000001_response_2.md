The error occurs at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` in the `_values_for_argsort` function. This means that there is an attempt to assign a value to a zero-size array, which leads to the ValueError: "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity".

This error occurs because when the input array is empty, the `data.min()` operation returns an empty array (`np.array([])`) and subtracting 1 from it causes the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the input array is empty by checking its size before performing the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
