The error occurs when trying to execute the function `_values_for_argsort` in the `IntegerArray` class. The specific line where the error occurs is `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. The error message indicates that it's due to a zero-size array being used in a reduction operation minimum that has no identity.

The bug occurs because the `data` array is empty (`array([], dtype=int64)`), and the `min()` operation on an empty array is invalid as there is no minimum value to compare.

To fix this bug, we can add a check for the empty array before performing the `min()` operation. If the array is empty, we can return an empty array without attempting to perform the `min()` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
