The issue seems to be related to the handling of empty arrays in the `value_counts` operation for `Int64` types. The provided function `_values_for_argsort` is not directly related to the issue described in the bug report, but it seems to be used in the context where the error occurs.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line seems to be attempting to handle empty arrays or arrays with a mask, but it is not handling the `Int64` type properly.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the empty array case for the `Int64` type, resulting in a ValueError when the min() function is applied to an empty array.

To fix this bug, the function should handle empty arrays of `Int64` type gracefully. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for empty arrays before applying the min() function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data  # Return empty array if the input data is empty

    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for empty arrays before applying any operation. If the input data is empty, the function returns the empty array directly, avoiding the application of the `min()` function on an empty array. This should prevent the ValueError from occurring in the original context described in the bug report.
