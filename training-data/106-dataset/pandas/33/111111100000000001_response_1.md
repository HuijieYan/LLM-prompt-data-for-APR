Potential error location:
In the function `_values_for_argsort`, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is attempting to assign a single value (`data.min() - 1`) to multiple elements of the array `data` based on the boolean mask `self._mask`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is likely causing the bug because it is trying to assign a single value to multiple elements based on a boolean mask, which may not work as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we should use boolean indexing to update the values in `data` based on the mask `self._mask`. This can be achieved by using boolean indexing to select specific elements of the array `data` and then assigning a new value to those selected elements.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
