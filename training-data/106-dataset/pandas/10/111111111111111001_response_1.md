The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates a problem with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment, specifically when trying to assign 2 input values to the 1 output value where the mask is true.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the boolean array being used as a mask for indexing is not aligned with the length of the new values being assigned. This mismatch in length causes the ValueError when trying to perform the assignment.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the mask aligns with the length of the new values before performing the assignment.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, the `mask` is first checked to ensure that it aligns with the length of the new values. If `new` is an array and its length matches the length of the mask, only the elements at the `True` positions of the mask are selected for assignment. This ensures that the mask and the values to be assigned align properly.
