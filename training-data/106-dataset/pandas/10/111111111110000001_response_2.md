The error seems to be occurring in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment, where the input values are not aligning properly with the output values based on the mask.

The potential error location is the line `new_values[mask] = new` in the `putmask` method.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `mask` and `new` arrays are of the same shape and align properly for the boolean array indexing assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
        mask = mask[:len(new)]  # Align mask length with new values

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if len(new) == np.sum(mask):  # Ensure new array aligns with mask
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        raise ValueError("Incompatible lengths: new and mask")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

This corrected code ensures that the mask and new values align properly for boolean array indexing assignment, and it also includes additional checks for compatible lengths between the new array and the mask.
