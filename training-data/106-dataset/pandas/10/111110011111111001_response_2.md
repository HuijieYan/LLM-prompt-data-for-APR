The error message indicates that there is a problem with the assignment operation using a boolean array index. 

Looking at the `putmask` method, the issue appears to be with the line `new_values[mask] = new`, where `new_values` is a NumPy array and `mask` is a boolean array. The error suggests that the assignment operation is trying to assign multiple values to a single output value where the mask is true.

This can occur due to an incorrect shape or size of the `mask` array causing mismatches in the assignment operation.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `mask` array and the array that it's indexing (`new_values`) are of the same shape and size.
2. Verify that the `mask` array is correctly representing the intended indices for the assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == np.sum(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new  # Ensuring mask and new_values have the same shape
    else:
        raise ValueError("Size of new array should match the number of True elements in the mask")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the size of the `mask` array matches the number of elements in the `new` array that correspond to `True` values in the mask. This should resolve the assignment issue.
