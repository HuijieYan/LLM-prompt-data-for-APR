The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment, specifically when trying to assign 2 input values to the 1 output value where the mask is true.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the statement `new_values[mask] = new` which is trying to assign multiple values to a single index within the `new_values` array, using a boolean mask.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `new_values` array and the `mask` array are not aligned properly for assignment.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to use boolean indexing to assign `new` at the appropriate locations in `new_values`.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new
    
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

This modification utilizes boolean indexing to directly assign the `new` values to the appropriate locations within the `new_values` array, as determined by the `mask`. This should resolve the issue of trying to assign multiple values to a single index.
