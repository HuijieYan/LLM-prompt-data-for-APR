The bug is caused by the use of boolean array indexing in the `putmask` method, specifically in the line `new_values[mask] = new`. The error message "ValueError: NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 3 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" indicates that there is an issue with assigning the values to the boolean mask.

This bug occurs because the `new`, `mask`, and `new_values` arrays have different lengths or dimensions, resulting in the assignment error. This might occur under various circumstances, such as when the `new` array has fewer elements than the `mask`, or when the `new_values` and `mask` have different shapes.

To fix this bug, the `putmask` method should ensure that the `new` and `mask` arrays have the same length and that the `new_values` array and `mask` array have the same shape before attempting the assignment.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if len(new) == len(mask):
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
        
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray):
            new = new[mask]
        
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
    else:
        # Handle the case when new and mask arrays have different lengths
        raise ValueError("Length of 'new' and 'mask' arrays must be the same.")
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the length of `new` is the same as the length of `mask`. If not, a `ValueError` is raised. Then, we reshape the `mask` array to match the shape of `new_values`. Finally, the corrected code performs the assignment `new_values[mask] = new` if the conditions are met.
