The error occurs in the `putmask` function within the `ExtensionBlock` class. It seems that the error is related to how the `new_values` array is being manipulated when applying the mask.

The error message indicates a problem with NumPy boolean array indexing. Specifically, it states that the assignment cannot assign 2 input values to the 1 output value where the mask is true.

This suggests that when trying to assign values to `new_values` based on the `mask`, the dimensions of the arrays are not aligning correctly. This could be due to a mismatch in the dimensions of the `new_values`, `mask`, and `new` arrays.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the dimensions of the arrays are compatible for the boolean indexing assignment. It may require reshaping, transposing, or modifying the arrays to align with each other properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function within the `ExtensionBlock` class:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if transpose:
        new_values = new_values.T  # Transpose if required

    new = _safe_reshape(new, mask.shape)  # Ensure new has the same shape as the mask

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, additional checks and operations are included to ensure that the dimensions of the arrays are aligned properly before performing the boolean indexing assignment. This should resolve the issue related to NumPy boolean array indexing.
