The error is occurring in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment when updating the values based on the mask.

The reason behind the bug is that when the `putmask` method is trying to update the values based on the mask, it is encountering an issue with the boolean array indexing assignment.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the boolean array indexing is handled correctly and the assignment of new values to the masked locations is done properly.

Here's the corrected `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values.copy() if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(new_values)]
```

The key correction here is to ensure that `new_values` is copied when `inplace` is `False`, to handle the update of the original values correctly. Additionally, the return statement should use `self.make_block(new_values)`.

With these corrections, the `putmask` method should work correctly for updating the values based on the provided mask and new values.
