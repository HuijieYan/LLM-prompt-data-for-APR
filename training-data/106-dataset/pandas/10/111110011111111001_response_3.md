The error in this case occurs because the `putmask` function attempts to assign the values to a specific position based on a mask, but the logic within the function is faulty, leading to a `ValueError` when trying to assign new values based on the mask.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `putmask` function to correctly handle the assignment based on the mask. The function should take into account the behavior of the mask and the shape of the new values to ensure proper assignment.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    
    # Adjust the shape of the mask if necessary
    if mask.ndim < new_values.ndim:
        mask = np.expand_dims(mask, axis=axis)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(new_values)]
```

In this corrected function, we have added a step to ensure that the mask's shape is compatible with the shape of `new_values` by using `np.expand_dims` if necessary. This modification ensures that the assignment based on the mask works correctly and avoids the ValueError that occurred in the previous implementation.
