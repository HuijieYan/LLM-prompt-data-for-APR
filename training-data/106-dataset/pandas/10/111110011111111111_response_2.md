The error occurs when the `putmask` function tries to update the `new_values` array using a boolean mask. The error message indicates that the boolean array indexing assignment is causing a problem when the mask is true.

The issue is likely caused by a mismatch in the lengths of the boolean mask and the `new` array. It seems that the boolean mask is not aligned with the `new` array, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the boolean mask and the `new` array have the same length before applying the indexing assignment.

Here's the corrected `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    if len(new) == len(mask):  # Ensure the lengths match before applying the mask
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
    else:
        # Handle the case where the lengths of mask and new do not match
        raise ValueError("The lengths of the mask and new values do not match.")
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to verify that the lengths of the boolean mask and the `new` array match before applying the mask. If the lengths do not match, the function raises a ValueError. This approach ensures that the boolean mask and the `new` array are aligned before updating `new_values`.
