The potential error in the given function is that the function is trying to call `self.make_block()` instead of referring to the `make_block()` function defined outside the class. Additionally, in the return statement, the function is trying to return a list of a single "Block" object, which is unnecessary as it can directly return the "Block" object itself.

The bug occurred because the function is calling a method `make_block` on `self`, which doesn't exist, and then returning a list of `Block` objects instead of just returning a single `Block` object.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `make_block` function defined outside the class, and then simply return the "Block" object without putting it into a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> "Block":
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return make_block(new_values)  # calling make_block function and directly returning the Block object
```
