The error message indicates a problem with the assignment of values to the `new_values` array within the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. This is likely the location of the bug.

The error occurs because the assignment `new_values[mask] = new` tries to assign multiple values from the `new` array to the `new_values` array using a boolean mask, but the lengths of the arrays don't match. This results in the "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 2 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" error.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the assignment of values to align with the boolean mask. One possible approach is to use boolean indexing to assign values to the `new_values` array based on the `mask`.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
    ) -> List["Block"]:
        """
        See Block.putmask.__doc__
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
        
        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
        
        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
        
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new_values[mask] = new
        else:
            new_values[self.values == mask] = new
        
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, we assign the values from `new` to `new_values` using boolean indexing based on the `mask`. This ensures that the values are assigned correctly and align with the boolean condition.

After making this change, the `putmask` method should work as expected without causing the "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment" error.
