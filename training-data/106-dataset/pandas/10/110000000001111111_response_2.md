The issue seems to be related to the `putmask` method of the `Block` class, which is causing a ValueError due to the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. The issue is occurring when the `mask` is used to index `new_values` and assign the `new` array to it.

The bug occurs because the `new` array has fewer values than the masked values in `new_values`, resulting in a ValueError. This is likely due to how the `mask` and `new` arrays are being handled.

To fix this bug, we can adjust the logic in the `putmask` method to handle the case where the `new` array does not have the same number of elements as the masked values in `new_values`. One possible approach is to resize the `new` array to match the size of the masked values before performing the assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    else:
        new = np.resize(new, new_values[mask].shape)

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

This corrected code first checks if the length of the `new` array matches the length of the `mask`. If not, it resizes the `new` array to match the shape of the masked values in `new_values` before performing the assignment. This should prevent the ValueError from occurring.
