The bug seems to be related to the `putmask` function in the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message mentions a ValueError related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. This indicates that there is an issue with assigning values to a NumPy boolean array using the mask.

The potential error location is the line `new_values[mask] = new` within the `putmask` function.

The bug occurred because the `putmask` function was trying to assign multiple values to a NumPy boolean array using the mask, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `putmask` function to iterate through the indices where the mask is True and then assign the new values one by one.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    for i in range(len(new_values)):
        if mask[i]:
            new_values[i] = new.pop(0)

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

Now the `putmask` function iterates through the indices where the mask is True and assigns the new values one by one, resolving the ValueError related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.
