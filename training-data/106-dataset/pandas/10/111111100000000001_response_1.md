The potential error in the `putmask` function is that the `make_block` method is being called incorrectly using `self.make_block` instead of passing it as an argument to the `make_block` function.

The bug occurs because the `make_block` function is a standalone function, not a method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. Therefore, it should be called directly as `make_block` with the appropriate arguments passed to it.

To fix the bug, the call to the `make_block` method should be replaced with a call to the `make_block` function, passing `self` as the first argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [make_block(new_values, self.placement)]
```
