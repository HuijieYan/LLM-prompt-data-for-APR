The issue seems to be related to the `putmask` method of the `Block` class, which is used by the `update` method of the `Series` class in Pandas. 

The error message "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 3 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" suggests that there is an issue with boolean array indexing assignment, possibly due to the `dtype="string"` in the Series.

The buggy function `putmask` in the `ExtensionBlock` class can be refactored to handle the `dtype="string"` issue and address the boolean array indexing assignment error.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    # convert new to array to handle dtype="string"
    new = np.array(new, dtype=self.dtype)

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values = np.where(mask, new, new_values)

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected version, `new` is converted to a NumPy array using the dtype of the Block, which should handle the `dtype="string"` issue. Additionally, boolean indexing assignment is achieved using `np.where` to avoid the previous error.
