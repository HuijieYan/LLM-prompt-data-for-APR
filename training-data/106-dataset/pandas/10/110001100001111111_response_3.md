The bug is occurring in the `putmask` function of the `ExtensionBlock` class. It appears that the error is caused by the use of boolean array indexing assignment with the new values. The error message "ValueError: NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 3 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" indicates that the shape of the boolean array used for indexing is not compatible with the shape of the new values array.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the dimensions of the boolean mask array and the new values array are compatible. This can be achieved by reshaping the mask array with the same shape as the new values array before performing the boolean array indexing assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)  # Reshape the mask array

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

By reshaping the mask array to match the shape of the new values array, the boolean array indexing assignment should no longer raise the ValueError.
