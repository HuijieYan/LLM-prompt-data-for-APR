Potential error location:
The error is occurring when trying to use boolean array indexing to assign new values to the existing values of the array. This is happening in the `putmask` function inside the `ExtensionBlock` class.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is happening because the boolean array indexing is not aligning correctly with the existing values or the new values in the array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The boolean array indexing needs to be handled more carefully, ensuring that the dimensions align properly and the assignment of new values follows the expected behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    # Modify the new_values based on the mask using the boolean array indexing
    if new.ndim == 1:
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new_values[mask] if not inplace else new_values[mask].copy()

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
In the corrected code, the boolean array indexing assignment is handled based on the dimension of the `new` array. If the `new` array has only one dimension, it directly assigns the new values. If the `new` array has more than one dimension, the assignment is handled in a more nuanced manner to ensure proper alignment and behavior.
