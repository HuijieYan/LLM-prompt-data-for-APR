Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class in the `blocks.py` file. The error is related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment not being able to assign multiple input values to a single output value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the behavior of the `update` method when using the nullable dtypes (e.g., dtype="string"). The `putmask` method is attempting to perform NumPy boolean array indexing assignment which is not compatible with the new nullable dtypes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the dtype and handle NumPy boolean array indexing assignment accordingly for the nullable dtypes.
2. Convert the nullable dtypes to their equivalent non-nullable dtypes for the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_10/pandas/core/internals/blocks.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ExtensionBlock(Block):
    """
    Block for holding extension types.

    Notes
    -----
    This holds all 3rd-party extension array types. It's also the immediate
    parent class for our internal extension types' blocks, CategoricalBlock.

    ExtensionArrays are limited to 1-D.
