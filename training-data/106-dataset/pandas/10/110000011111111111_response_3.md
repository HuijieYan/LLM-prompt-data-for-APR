The error message indicates that there is an issue with boolean array indexing assignment in the `putmask` function. The error occurs when the number of input values does not match the number of output values where the mask is true.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the boolean array indexing and assignment properly. When updating a Series with nullable dtypes, such as string, Int64, or boolean, the `putmask` function is not able to handle the assignment when the mask is a boolean array.

To fix this bug, the `putmask` function should properly handle the boolean array indexing assignment. This can be achieved by ensuring that the size of the new values matches the size of the mask when performing the boolean array indexing assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if mask.shape != new.shape:
        raise ValueError("The size of new values does not match the size of the mask.")

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

With this fix, the boolean array indexing assignment in the `putmask` function will handle the size mismatch properly, and the bug should be resolved.
