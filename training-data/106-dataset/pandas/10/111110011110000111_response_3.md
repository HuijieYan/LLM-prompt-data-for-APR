The error is occurring in the `putmask` function of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates that the issue is related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment when using nullable dtypes (such as "string").

The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of nullable dtypes within the `putmask` function. The function is not properly handling the masking and assignment with nullable dtypes, leading to a ValueError when trying to update the values.

To fix the bug, the `putmask` function needs to be modified to properly handle nullable dtypes, such as "string" and "Int64". This may involve adjusting the masking logic and the way values are assigned based on the mask.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
# corrected putmask function
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values.copy() if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if isinstance(new_values, pd.StringArray):
        new_values.pandas_array[mask] = new
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

The `putmask` function is now modified to check for the type of `new_values`. If it's a `pd.StringArray`, it uses `pandas_array` to update the values, otherwise, it directly updates using indexing. This approach ensures that the assignment works correctly for nullable dtypes such as "string."

By applying these changes, the `putmask` function should now work correctly with nullable dtypes, and the ValueError encountered in the test cases should be resolved.
