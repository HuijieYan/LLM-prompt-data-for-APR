The buggy function `putmask` tries to modify the values of an object based on a mask. The code seems to be written for a class method, as it has the `self` parameter, but it is defined outside of any class, which is not valid in Python.

It's likely that this function needs to be inside a class, so the `self` parameter can be used to access the data and methods of the class instance. The function also tries to call `self.make_block`, but given that it's outside a class, this code will not work.

Therefore, the fix involves moving this function inside a class and accessing the method via the class instance, or modifying the class it belongs to with the correct method.

Here's the corrected code in the context of a class:

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, values, make_block):
        self.values = values
        self.make_block = make_block
    
    def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
    ) -> List["Block"]:
        """
        See Block.putmask.__doc__
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    
        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]
    
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
    
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this example, I've added a `Block` class and moved the `make_block` method into it. This way, the function has access to `self.make_block` and can use it properly.
