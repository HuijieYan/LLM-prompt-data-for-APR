The bug in this code is caused by the line `new = new[mask]`. This line attempts to index the array `new` based on the boolean array `mask`. However, this can cause errors if `new` is not a numpy array or if the lengths of `new` and `mask` are different.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `new` is a numpy array and if its length is equal to the length of the `mask` array. If both conditions are met, we can proceed with the indexing operation. Otherwise, we can raise an error or handle the situation gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    elif len(new) != len(mask):
        raise ValueError("Length of 'new' must be equal to length of 'mask'.")

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
