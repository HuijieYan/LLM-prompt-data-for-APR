The buggy function is `putmask` within the `ExtensionBlock` class. 

Based on the input parameter values and types in Buggy Cases 1-3, this function is supposed to modify the `self.values` array by replacing the elements at the indices where `mask` is True with the corresponding elements from the `new` array. 

The error in the current implementation is in the line:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```
This is erroneous as the indexing with `mask` and assigning `new` to these indices does not work correctly with the array types such as `StringArray`, `IntegerArray`, and `BooleanArray` as `_extract_bool_array` converts these arrays to a `np.ndarray` without preserving their original state, thereby not being able to index `new_values` properly.

To fix this issue, we need to first convert the `mask` to an actual boolean array. Then, we can use boolean masking to update the `new_values`.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = np.asanyarray(mask, dtype=bool)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    target_indices = np.flatnonzero(mask)
    new_values[target_indices] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
