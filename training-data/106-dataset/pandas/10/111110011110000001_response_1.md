The error message indicates that there is an issue with boolean array indexing assignment within the `putmask` function of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error occurs when attempting to assign new values to the array using boolean indexing.

The bug seems to stem from the way boolean indexing is being applied to the `new_values` array. It appears that the boolean mask and the new values are not aligning correctly, leading to a ValueError due to mismatched lengths.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the boolean mask and the new values have the same length and align properly for the assignment.

Here's the corrected `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        raise ValueError("Length of new values must match the boolean mask.")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected function, we check for the length of the `new` array and ensure that it matches the length of the boolean `mask` before applying the boolean indexing assignment. If the lengths do not match, a ValueError is raised to indicate the issue. This fix ensures that the boolean mask and the new values align properly, addressing the bug encountered in the original function.
