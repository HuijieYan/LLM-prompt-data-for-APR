The error message indicates that there is an issue with the assignment of values to the `new_values` array within the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class, specifically with boolean array indexing.

The bug seems to be due to the mishandling of boolean array indexing in the `putmask` method. The way the boolean array is used as an index to assign new values to `new_values` results in a ValueError, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, you can modify the assignment line `new_values[mask] = new` in the `putmask` method to use boolean indexing properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    # Apply the mask to new_values using boolean indexing
    new_values[mask] = np.where(mask, new, new_values[mask])
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

With this correction, the boolean indexing is applied correctly to update `new_values` according to the given `mask` and `new` values. This should resolve the ValueError and ensure the `putmask` method functions properly.
