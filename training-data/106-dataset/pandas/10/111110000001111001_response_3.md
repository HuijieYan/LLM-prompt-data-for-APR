The buggy function `putmask` takes five parameters: mask, new, inplace, axis, and transpose. The method appears to be designed to apply a mask to the current block values and update them with new values where the mask is true. However, the implementation contains a bug that causes it to modify the original `self.values` array instead of working on a copy when `inplace` is set to `True`.

The error is occurring due to the incorrect usage of the inplace flag. When `inplace` is `True`, the method directly modifies `self.values` which is not intended. The method should create a copy of `self.values` and operate on that copy instead.

To resolve this bug, the following adjustment should be made:

1. If `inplace` is True, perform `new_values = self.values.copy()` to create a new copy of the values array.
2. If `inplace` is False, use `new_values = self.values` to set the copy of the values array.
3. Update the new values in `new_values` based on the mask condition.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    if inplace:
        new_values = self.values.copy()
    else:
        new_values = self.values
    
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
