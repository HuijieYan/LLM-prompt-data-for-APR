The error message indicates that the `update` method is calling the `putmask` method, which in turn is trying to assign multiple values to a NumPy boolean array where the mask is true. This is resulting in a ValueError.

The issue likely lies within the `putmask` method in the `ExtensionBlock` class as indicated by the error message.

The problem occurs because the boolean array indexing assignment is unable to handle the new nullable dtypes such as string and Int16, which have pd.NA values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the putmask method such that it handles the new nullable dtypes correctly, and does not attempt to assign multiple values to the NumPy boolean array where the mask is true.

Here's the corrected code for the putmask method in the ExtensionBlock class:

```python
def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

        # Make a copy of the values if inplace is False
        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

        # Update the values based on the mask and the new values
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]

        # Make sure the mask has the same shape as the values
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

        # Assign the new values to the locations specified by the mask
        new_values[mask] = new

        # Return a new Block with the updated values
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected method, we ensure that we handle the new nullable dtypes correctly, and we make sure that the assignment to the boolean array is done in a way that avoids the ValueError.

With this fix, the Series.update() method should work as expected for all dtypes, including the new nullable dtypes like string and Int16.
