The bug is occurring in the `putmask` function within the `Block` class. The error message suggests that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment when the mask is true.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the new nullable dtypes properly. When the mask is true and the dtype is string or Int16, it tries to assign multiple values to a single output value, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `putmask` function correctly handles the new nullable dtypes. We can achieve this by checking the dtype of the values before performing the assignment and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if new_values.dtype.kind == 'O' or pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(new_values):
        for i, v in enumerate(mask):
            if v:
                new_values[i] = new[i % len(new)]
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we first check the dtype of `new_values`. If it is a string or object dtype, we iterate over the mask and assign values one by one. Otherwise, we perform the assignment as before. This should handle the new nullable dtypes correctly and resolve the ValueError issue.
