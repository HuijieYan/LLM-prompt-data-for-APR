Potential error location:
The potential error in the function is with the line `new_values[mask] = new`. This is where the bug is likely occurring.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `new` array is not being reshaped to match the shape of the `new_values` array before being assigned to `new_values` using the mask.

Approach to fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `new` array is reshaped to match the shape of the `new_values` array before using the mask to assign its values to `new_values`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    
    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new = _safe_reshape(new, new_values.shape)  # Reshape new array to match new_values shape
    
    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
