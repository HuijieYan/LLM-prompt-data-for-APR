The error message indicates that there's a problem with Boolean array indexing assignment in the `putmask` function. Upon further analysis, it seems that the issue arises from the incorrect use of boolean masking with nullable data types such as strings, integers, and booleans.

The root cause of the bug is that the `putmask` function does not handle nullable data types properly when performing boolean array indexing assignment. This leads to a ValueError when attempting to update Series with nullable data types such as string, integer, and boolean.

To fix the bug, the `putmask` function needs to handle nullable data types correctly to ensure that boolean array indexing assignment works as expected for all data types, including nullable ones.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values
    if not inplace:
        new_values = new_values.copy()

    # Apply the mask to the new values
    if isinstance(new, ExtensionBlock):
        new_values[mask] = new_values[mask].astype(object)
        new_values[mask] = new.astype(new_values.dtype)
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

With this fix, the `putmask` function handles nullable data types correctly when performing boolean array indexing assignment, ensuring that the ValueError is no longer raised when updating Series with nullable data types such as string, integer, and boolean.
