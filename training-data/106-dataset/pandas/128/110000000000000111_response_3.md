The error is related to the default encoding used by the `open` function when called by `read_json`. The issue occurs because the `open` function uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding, which may not always be UTF-8.

To fix this issue, we can explicitly specify the `encoding` parameter in the `open` function within the `read_json` method to ensure that it always uses UTF-8 encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` method:

```python
# Corrected read_json function
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly setting UTF-8 as the default encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    [Rest of the function remains unchanged]
    """
```

By explicitly setting the `encoding` parameter to `'utf-8'` in the `read_json` method, we ensure that the default encoding used for reading JSON files is always UTF-8, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.
