The error seems to be related to the encoding being used when a file is opened by the `read_json()` method. The default encoding should be UTF-8, but in some cases, it may not be used correctly, resulting in incorrect reading of the file.

The potential error location is the way the file is opened within the `read_json()` function. It uses the built-in `open()` method without specifying the encoding, which can lead to the default encoding of the system being used, potentially resulting in incorrect character decoding.

The bug occurs because the `open()` method defaults to the system's preferred encoding if the encoding parameter is not specified. This can lead to inconsistent behavior across different systems.

To fix this bug, the `open()` method should be called with the `encoding='utf-8'` parameter to ensure that the file is opened with the correct encoding, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.

Here is the corrected code for the `read_json()` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding=None,
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    # Replace the following line
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )
    
    # with
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding='utf-8', compression=compression
    )
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

By explicitly specifying the encoding as 'utf-8' when opening the file, we ensure consistent behavior across different systems and avoid potential encoding-related issues.
