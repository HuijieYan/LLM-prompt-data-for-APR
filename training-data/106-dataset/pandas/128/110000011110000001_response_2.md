The error is in the `read_json` function, specifically in the handling of the `encoding` parameter. The error message indicates a problem with the column names when comparing the result with the expected DataFrame.

The issue is likely due to the encoding mismatch between writing and reading the JSON file. The function `read_json` needs to handle the encoding properly to read the content of the JSON file correctly.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the encoding parameter is passed correctly to handle the special characters in the JSON file.
2. Check if the `encoding` parameter is properly handled when opening the file for reading.

Here's the corrected `read_json` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Set default encoding to utf-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    compression = _infer_compression(path_or_buf, compression)
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    with open(filepath_or_buffer, mode='r', encoding=encoding) as file:
        # Read the JSON file using the specified encoding
        data = json.load(file)

    if chunksize:
        return data

    if should_close:
        filepath_or_buffer.close()

    return data

# ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

In this correction:
- The default encoding for reading the JSON file is set to 'utf-8' to handle special characters.
- The file is opened and read using the specified encoding to ensure that the content is read correctly.

With these changes, the `read_json` function should be able to handle the special characters in the JSON file properly and the test case should pass without any encoding-related issues.
