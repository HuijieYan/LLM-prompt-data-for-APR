The issue here is that the `read_json` function does not use utf-8 as the default encoding when opening the file, which can lead to encoding issues when reading JSON files. This bug occurs because the function uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding, which may not always be utf-8.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `read_json` function uses utf-8 encoding by default when opening the file, regardless of the system's preferred encoding. This can be achieved by explicitly setting the `encoding` parameter in the `open` method to 'utf-8' when opening the file.

Here is the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # explicitly setting utf-8 as the default encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (other parameters and documentation remain unchanged)

    # update the code to use encoding='utf-8' when opening the file
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

By explicitly setting the `encoding` parameter to 'utf-8' in the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function, we ensure that utf-8 encoding is used by default when opening the JSON file, addressing the original issue.
