The test case is trying to write a JSON file with Unicode characters and then read it using the `read_json` function. However, when comparing the DataFrame columns, it fails because the columns are different due to the presence of Unicode characters.

The potential error location within the `read_json` function is the decoding of the JSON file. It seems that the encoding or decoding of Unicode characters is not handled correctly.

The reason for the bug is likely that the default encoding or decoding method used when writing and reading the JSON file does not support Unicode characters properly. This leads to a mismatch in the data when comparing the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly specify the encoding when opening the file for writing and reading. This will ensure that the Unicode characters are handled correctly during the file operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly specify the encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    Rest of the function remains the same
    """
    # Existing implementation remains the same
```

By explicitly specifying the encoding as 'utf-8' when opening the JSON file, we ensure that the Unicode characters are handled correctly during writing and reading operations. This should resolve the issue with comparing the DataFrame columns and the test case should pass without errors.
