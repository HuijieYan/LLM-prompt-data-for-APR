The issue is related to the encoding of the file read by `pd.read_json()`. The problem arises when the default encoding of the system is not UTF-8, causing the pandas library to use a different encoding despite the documentation stating that it should use UTF-8 by default.

The problem lies in the `path_or_buf` parameter handling, specifically in the function `_infer_compression(path_or_buf, compression)` or `get_filepath_or_buffer(path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression)` within the pandas library. This is where the encoding for reading the file is determined based on the system's preferred encoding.

To fix the bug, the `pd.read_json()` function should explicitly specify the `encoding` parameter as 'utf-8' when opening the file.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    <rest of the function remains unchanged>
    """
    # Existing code remains unchanged from here
```

By explicitly setting the `encoding` parameter to 'utf-8', the bug related to using the system's default encoding for file reading can be resolved. This change ensures that the pandas library will always use UTF-8 encoding when reading JSON files, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.
