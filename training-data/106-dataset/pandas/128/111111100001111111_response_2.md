The bug occurs in the `read_json` function of the provided code. It seems that the bug is causing the function to not use the correct default encoding (utf-8) when the encoding parameter is not given and the file is opened with the `open` method.

The reason for the bug is that the `read_json` function is not explicitly setting the encoding to utf-8 when opening the file, which causes it to use the system's default encoding instead. This behavior is not consistent with the documentation, which states that utf-8 should be used as the default encoding when the encoding parameter is not provided.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to explicitly set the encoding to utf-8 when opening the file inside the `read_json` function. This will ensure that utf-8 is used as the default encoding, as specified in the documentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Set encoding to utf-8 by default
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    """
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Update the code to explicitly specify encoding as utf-8 when opening the file
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding='utf-8', compression=compression
    )

    json_reader = JsonReader(
        filepath_or_buffer,
        orient=orient,
        typ=typ,
        dtype=dtype,
        convert_axes=convert_axes,
        convert_dates=convert_dates,
        keep_default_dates=keep_default_dates,
        numpy=numpy,
        precise_float=precise_float,
        date_unit=date_unit,
        encoding='utf-8',  # Set encoding to utf-8 by default
        lines=lines,
        chunksize=chunksize,
        compression=compression,
    )

    if chunksize:
        return json_reader

    result = json_reader.read()
    if should_close:
        filepath_or_buffer.close()

    return result
```

With this fix, the `read_json` function should now consistently use utf-8 as the default encoding, as expected according to the documentation.
