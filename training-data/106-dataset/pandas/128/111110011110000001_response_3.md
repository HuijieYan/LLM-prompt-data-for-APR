The test case is attempting to read a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then compare the result with an expected DataFrame. The error message indicates that the columns of the actual DataFrame and the expected DataFrame are different. The issue is related to the encoding of the file, as the test case sets the file's encoding to "utf-8" when writing, but it tries to read the file with a different encoding due to the monkeypatching of `"_bootlocale.getpreferredencoding"` to "cp949".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `encoding` parameter. The `read_json` function doesn't consider the `encoding` parameter properly when reading the JSON file, leading to the mismatch in column names.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the `encoding` parameter correctly, causing issues when reading the contents of the JSON file. This leads to the mismatch in column names between the actual and expected DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the `read_json` function should explicitly use the `encoding` parameter when reading the file to ensure that the file is read with the correct encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding="utf-8",  # Set the default encoding to utf-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # Existing code ...

    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    # Existing code ...
```

By explicitly using the `encoding` parameter when getting the file buffer in the `read_json` function, the function will use the correct encoding when reading the JSON file, resolving the mismatch in column names and fixing the bug.
