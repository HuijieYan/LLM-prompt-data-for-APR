The test case is trying to write a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then read it back using the `read_json` function. However, the error message indicates that the column names are different between the expected DataFrame and the actual result.

The potential error in the `read_json` function could be related to the encoding and decoding of the JSON file. It seems that the function is not handling non-ASCII characters properly when reading the JSON file.

The bug is occurring because the `read_json` function is not encoding and decoding the JSON file using the appropriate character encoding.

To fix the bug, the `read_json` function should explicitly specify the encoding as 'utf-8' when reading the JSON file.

Here's the corrected `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Specify 'utf-8' encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (other function code remains the same)

    # Replace this line
    # filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
    #     path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    # )
    # with
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    # ... (rest of the function code remains the same)
```

By explicitly specifying the encoding as 'utf-8' when reading the JSON file, the function should be able to handle non-ASCII characters properly and resolve the error.
