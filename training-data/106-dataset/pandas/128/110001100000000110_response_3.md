The issue with the function `read_json` is that when encoding parameter is not given, it calls built-in `open()` method to open a file and `open()` uses return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding which can be something not utf-8.

Here is the corrected `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding="utf-8",  # Default encoding set to utf-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    (Rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """
```

The default encoding parameter has been set to "utf-8" to ensure that the function uses utf-8 as the default encoding for reading JSON files. This addresses the issue where the function was using a different default encoding based on the system configuration.
