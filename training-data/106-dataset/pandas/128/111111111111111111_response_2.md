The test case "test_readjson_unicode" is trying to verify the behavior of the function read_json when the file encoding is not explicitly specified. The test creates a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then uses read_json to read it into a DataFrame.

The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different, which suggests that the function is not handling the file encoding correctly when reading the JSON file.

It is likely that the error is occurring when the function tries to read the JSON file without explicitly specifying the file encoding, causing it to use the default encoding provided by the system, which may not be utf-8.

The bug is occurring because the read_json function is not explicitly specifying the file encoding when opening the JSON file. This can lead to incorrect decoding of non-ASCII characters.

To fix the bug, the read_json function should explicitly specify utf-8 as the file encoding when opening the JSON file to ensure that non-ASCII characters are correctly decoded.

Here's the corrected code for the read_json function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly specify utf-8 as the file encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters remain unchanged)
    encoding : str, default is 'utf-8'
        The encoding to use to decode py3 bytes.
    ...
    """
    # Existing code remains unchanged
```

By explicitly specifying utf-8 as the file encoding, the read_json function will ensure that non-ASCII characters are correctly decoded from the JSON file.
