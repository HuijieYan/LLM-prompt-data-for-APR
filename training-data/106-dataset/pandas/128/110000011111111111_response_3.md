The error message indicates that the "£©µÀÆÖÞßéöÿ" string is being interpreted incorrectly, resulting in different DataFrame columns than expected.

The potential error location within the `read_json` function is likely related to the handling of the file encoding. In the test case, the file is written using UTF-8 encoding, but the `read_json` function may be using a different encoding when reading the file, leading to incorrect interpretation of the unicode characters.

The bug is occurring because the `open` method inside the `read_json` function uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding, which may not be UTF-8 in all cases.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when opening the file for reading inside the `read_json` function. This will ensure that the file is read using the correct encoding, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.

Below is the corrected version of the `read_json` function with the update to explicitly specify the UTF-8 encoding when opening the file:

```python
# corrected function
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # specify UTF-8 encoding explicitly
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By explicitly specifying the `encoding` parameter in the `open` function, we ensure that the file is read using the correct UTF-8 encoding, thus resolving the issue with incorrect interpretation of unicode characters.

This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that `read_json` consistently uses UTF-8 encoding for file reading, as specified in the documentation.
