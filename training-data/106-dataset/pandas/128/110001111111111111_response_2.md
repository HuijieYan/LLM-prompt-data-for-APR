The test case creates a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then attempts to read it using the `pd.read_json()` function. It uses a monkeypatch to set the preferred encoding to 'cp949', which leads to an encoding mismatch issue.

The potential error location is in the `read_json()` function, specifically in the usage of the `open()` method without specifying the encoding. This causes the default encoding to be determined by `locale.getpreferredencoding()`.

The error occurs because the `open()` method, when used without specifying the encoding, determines the encoding based on the system's preferred encoding, which may not always be 'utf-8'. This leads to an encoding mismatch when trying to read the file containing non-ASCII characters.

To fix the bug, the `open()` method should be called with the `encoding='utf-8'` parameter when reading the JSON file to ensure that the data is correctly decoded as UTF-8, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json()` function:

```python
def read_json(path_or_buf=None, orient=None, typ="frame", dtype=None, convert_axes=None, convert_dates=True, keep_default_dates=True, numpy=False, precise_float=False, date_unit=None, encoding=None, lines=False, chunksize=None, compression="infer"):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    Parameters...
    """

    # ... (omitted code)

    with get_filepath_or_buffer(path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression) as filepath_or_buffer:
        json_reader = JsonReader(
            filepath_or_buffer,
            orient=orient,
            typ=typ,
            dtype=dtype,
            convert_axes=convert_axes,
            convert_dates=convert_dates,
            keep_default_dates=keep_default_dates,
            numpy=numpy,
            precise_float=precise_float,
            date_unit=date_unit,
            encoding=encoding,
            lines=lines,
            chunksize=chunksize,
            compression=compression,
        )

        if chunksize:
            return json_reader

        result = json_reader.read()

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `open()` method has been replaced with `get_filepath_or_buffer()` which handles the file opening with the specified encoding. This change ensures that the file is opened with the correct encoding, resolving the encoding mismatch issue.
