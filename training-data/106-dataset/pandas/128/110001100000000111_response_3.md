The error seems to be related to the default encoding not being set to UTF-8 when using `pd.read_json()` without specifying the encoding explicitly.

The potential error location within the code is the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function, where the encoding parameter is not being set to the default value of 'utf-8'.

The reason behind the bug is that the default encoding is not explicitly set to 'utf-8', causing the function to rely on the system's preferred encoding, which may not always be 'utf-8'.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly set the default encoding to 'utf-8' when opening the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def read_json(
        path_or_buf=None,
        orient=None,
        typ="frame",
        dtype=None,
        convert_axes=None,
        convert_dates=True,
        keep_default_dates=True,
        numpy=False,
        precise_float=False,
        date_unit=None,
        encoding='utf-8',  # setting default encoding to utf-8
        lines=False,
        chunksize=None,
        compression="infer",
    ):
        """
        Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
        (Remaining code remains the same)
        """
```

By explicitly setting the default encoding to 'utf-8' in the function signature, we ensure that the function uses 'utf-8' as the default encoding when opening the file, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
