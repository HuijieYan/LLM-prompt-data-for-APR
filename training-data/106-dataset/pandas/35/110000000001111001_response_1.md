The error in the provided function is that it uses a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not a standard Python decorator and is not defined in the code. 

Additionally, the function is trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` but then tries to pass it as an argument to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This is not the correct usage of weak references.

To fix the bug, the `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be replaced with a proper decorator or removed altogether if it's not necessary.

The correct implementation of the function without the decorator and with proper usage of weak references would be as follows:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

It's important to note that the correct usage of weak references depends on the context and how the object is being used later in the code.
