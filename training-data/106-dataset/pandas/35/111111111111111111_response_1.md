The error occurs in the `@cache_readonly` decorated function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` it requires, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The bug is likely occurring because the weak reference to `self` is being dropped prematurely or not handling weak references properly.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be handled correctly within the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely and is accessible to the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
