Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the _engine method, where a weak reference of self (period) is created but not used properly leading to the issue of weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The weak reference of self (period) is not being utilized correctly, leading to a None value being passed to the _engine_type method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference of self (period) is being passed correctly to the _engine_type method.
2. Check for any other potential issues related to weak references and ensure they are being used properly within the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cache'):
            self._cache = {}
        if func.__name__ not in self._cache:
            self._cache[func.__name__] = func(self)
        return self._cache[func.__name__]
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
