Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring within the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely.
2. Modify the _engine function to properly handle the weakly referenced PeriodIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```
In the corrected code, the weakref is properly passed to the _engine_type function, along with the length of the PeriodIndex and the PeriodIndex itself. This should prevent the issue of getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex within the PeriodEngine.
