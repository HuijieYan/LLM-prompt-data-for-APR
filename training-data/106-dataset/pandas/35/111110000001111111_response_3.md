Potential error location: The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to a `PeriodIndex` instance, but it's not being used properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance is not being maintained properly, causing it to be dropped before intended.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is being maintained properly.
2. Check if there are any issues with the weak reference being created or accessed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
