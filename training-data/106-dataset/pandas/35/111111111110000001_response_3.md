The error message indicates an AttributeError stating that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that there is an issue with the 'PeriodEngine' in the '_engine' method. It is likely that the PeriodEngine is not being properly initialized or constructed, leading to a NoneType object being returned instead of the expected engine object.

The reason behind this bug could be that the method '_engine' is not properly instantiating the PeriodEngine.

To fix this bug, the _engine method should be updated to properly instantiate the PeriodEngine and return the engine object.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine_type._invariants()
    return engine_type
```
