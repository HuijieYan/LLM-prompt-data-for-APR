The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of weakref.ref(self) in the _engine function. This is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine getting a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, the weakly referenced PeriodIndex should be maintained until the intended usage. This can be achieved by modifying the _engine function to store the weakly referenced PeriodIndex and utilize it when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to self, the PeriodIndex will be maintained until it is used by the PeriodEngine, resolving the bug.
