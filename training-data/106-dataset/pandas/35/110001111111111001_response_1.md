The error message indicates an 'AttributeError' in the 'pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.is_monotonic_increasing' method, which is caused by a 'NoneType' object that has no attribute 'view'. This points to a potential issue in the '_engine' method of the 'PeriodIndex' class.

The bug likely occurs because the '_engine' method is returning a 'NoneType' object instead of an instance of 'PeriodEngine' class, which leads to an 'AttributeError' when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix the bug, the '_engine' method should be modified to return an instance of the 'PeriodEngine' class instead of 'NoneType'.

```python
# Corrected function
from weakref import ref

def _engine(self):
    period = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```
