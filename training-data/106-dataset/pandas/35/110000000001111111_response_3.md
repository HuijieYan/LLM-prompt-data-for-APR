The bug seems to be related to the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` method. It appears that the `period` variable should be holding a weak reference to `self`, but it is assigned `weakref.ref(self)` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
import weakref

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change should ensure that a weak reference to the `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` method, preventing the reference cycle issue and potential memory leaks.
