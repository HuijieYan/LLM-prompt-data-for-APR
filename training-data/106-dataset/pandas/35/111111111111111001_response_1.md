Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. 

Reasons Behind the Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the _engine function is returning self._engine_type, but the implementation of _engine_type seems to be incorrect, resulting in a 'NoneType' object error when attempting to call the view function on it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to fix the _engine function to return a valid object instead of NoneType when calling the view function on it. This might involve checking the implementation of _engine_type, ensuring it's correctly instantiated and returning the expected object type.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine
```
