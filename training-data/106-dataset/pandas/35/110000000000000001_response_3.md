Potential error location: 
The function is trying to use a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not defined.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The decorator `@cache_readonly` is not defined in the given code, which is causing the function to fail.
2. It seems like the intention was to use a caching mechanism, but the decorator `@cache_readonly` is missing.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `@cache_readonly` decorator or use a different caching mechanism to achieve the intended functionality.
2. Use the correct approach for caching the result of the `_engine` method.

Corrected code:

```python
import functools

def cache_readonly(func):
    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        return func(self)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In the corrected code, we have defined the `cache_readonly` decorator using `functools.lru_cache`, and applied it to the `_engine` method using `@cache_readonly` decorator. This will effectively cache the result of the `_engine` method and solve the bug.
