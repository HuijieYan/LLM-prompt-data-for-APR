1. The test case involves creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then trying to access the level values and check if they are monotonic. However, when attempting to do so, an AttributeError is raised, indicating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_engine` method, specifically the line that returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The occurrence of the bug is due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before it is intended. Therefore, the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the index values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Ensuring that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the operation that involves accessing the index values.
   b. Validating the PeriodIndex reference and handling it accordingly within the `_engine` method to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain weak reference to self
    if period() is not None:  # Validate the weak reference
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise Exception("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is None.")
```
