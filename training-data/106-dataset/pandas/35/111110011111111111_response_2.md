The error occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is responsible for returning an instance of the `_engine_type` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not properly being passed to the `_engine_type` class. As a result, the `_engine` function's weak reference isn't being maintained, leading to a `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref(self)` should be properly used to maintain the weak reference to `self` when passing it to `_engine_type`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we obtain the original object referenced by the weak reference, fixing the attribute error that was occurring.
