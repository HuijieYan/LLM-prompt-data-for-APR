The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The purpose of using weak references is to avoid circular references that could lead to memory leaks when the reference count of an object is never decremented to zero. However, the usage of a weak reference seems unnecessary here, and this could be the source of the bug.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to create a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference. After modifying the function, it should return an instance of the `_engine_type` using `self` as an argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the correct `self` instance is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, and it uses a strong reference without the need for weak references.
