The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This is likely due to the way weak references are being handled in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class.

The potential error location is within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically in the weak reference handling.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be properly maintained in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored and accessed when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period else None
```

By adding the check `if period else None`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and any potential `None` values are accounted for.

This fix should address the bug and prevent the `NoneType` attribute error.
