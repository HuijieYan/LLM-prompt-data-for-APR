The error "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" occurs when using the `pct_change` function with the `freq` parameter set to 'BM'. The issue seems to stem from the reindexing of the data after calculating the percentage change.

The potential error location in the code is around the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. It seems that the reindexing process is causing the duplicate axis error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the reindexing is trying to realign the data based on the frequency 'BM' which is resulting in a duplicate axis.

To fix the bug, we can modify the reindexing process for the `pct_change` function. Instead of reindexing the result directly, we can use the `asfreq` method to align the index with the frequency specified. Then, we can proceed with the percentage change calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    data_asfreq = data.asfreq(freq)
    
    rs = data_asfreq.div(data_asfreq.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

With this corrected code, the `pct_change` function should work as expected and the error related to the frequency set as 'BM' should be resolved. Additionally, it no longer reindexes the result directly, but uses the `asfreq` method for alignment before calculating the percentage change.
