The error is occurring because the `pct_change` method is trying to reindex the result, but the index is not unique. This is likely due to the `freq` parameter and the use of `reindex_like` in the code.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `pct_change` method to handle the frequency correctly and ensure that the index is unique.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        if freq is not None:
            data = self.asfreq(freq)
        else:
            data = self

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    return rs
```

In this code, we check if the `freq` parameter is not `None`, and if so, we use `asfreq` to resample the data with the specified frequency. This should ensure that the index is unique and prevent the "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" from occurring.
