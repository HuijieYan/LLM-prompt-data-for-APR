The test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` is calling the `pct_change` method on a Series with specified frequency. The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis.

It seems that the problem is occurring in the `pct_change` method's `reindex_like` function. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates.

The bug is happening because the `reindex_like` function is attempting to reindex the `rs` Series with the having a `freq` argument specified, and the `common_idx` index also has duplicate values (as indicated by the error message).

To fix the bug, we can remove the duplicate values from the index before using it in the `reindex` method. We can achieve this by using the `drop_duplicates` method on the index.

```python
# this is the corrected function after fixing the bug
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    
    # Drop duplicate values from index before reindexing
    rs = rs.reindex(data.index.drop_duplicates())
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

This code should fix the issue by ensuring that `rs` is reindexed with an index that does not contain duplicate values.
