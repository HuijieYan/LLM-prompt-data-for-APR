The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates. This suggests that the problem lies with the reindexing step within the `pct_change` function.

The reason for this bug is that the `reindex_like(data)` call within the `pct_change` function is causing a ValueError due to reindexing from a duplicate axis.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the reindexing logic to handle duplicate axis values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.reindex(self.index)
        if freq is None:
            mask = rs.isna()
            rs = rs.mask(mask)
        return rs
```

In the corrected code, the `reindex_like(data)` call has been replaced with `rs = rs.reindex(self.index)`. This change ensures that reindexing is performed using the index of the `rs` variable, avoiding the duplicate axis issue. Additionally, the `mask` function has been used to handle NaN values in the `rs` variable.
