Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the calculation of the 'rs' variable, specifically in the division operation using the 'div' method and the subsequent subtraction operation. 
Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The bug is likely caused by issues in the calculation of 'rs' due to incorrect data manipulation and usage of methods like 'div' and 'shift'. The result of these operations is leading to unexpected values and data types, such as 'inf' and 'NaN' values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the input data and parameters to ensure that they are appropriately processed by operations like 'div' and 'shift'.
2. Check for potential data inconsistencies or anomalies that could lead to unexpected results.
3. Review the 'div' and 'shift' methods to ensure that they are being used correctly with the appropriate data types and parameters.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    # Check if fill_method is None
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        # Apply fillna method to fill missing values
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    # Perform division operation to calculate percentage change
    rs = data.divide(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, fill_value=None)) - 1
    # Reindex based on 'data' 
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    # Mask NaN values in the result
    mask = rs.isna()
    rs[mask] = np.nan
    
    return rs
```
In the corrected code:
- The fillna method is used with 'value' and 'method' arguments to fill missing values.
- The division operation now uses the 'divide' method instead of 'data.div' to ensure correct computation.
- NaN values are masked using the 'isna' method and replaced with 'np.nan' in the result.
