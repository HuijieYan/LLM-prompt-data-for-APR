The error message states that the function "pct_change" is throwing a "ValueError" because it cannot reindex from a duplicate axis. This error is occurring in the "reindex_like" function, specifically in the line "rs = rs.reindex_like(data)".

The potential error location within the "pct_change" function is the "reindex_like" method, which is trying to reindex the result ("rs") to the shape of the original data ("data").

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "reindex_like" method is unable to handle duplicate axis in the index.

To fix the bug, the "reindex_like" method needs to be modified to handle duplicate axis in the index by first checking if the index is unique before attempting the reindex operation.

Here's the corrected code for the "pct_change" function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected function, the line "rs = rs.reindex_like(data)" has been removed, and the "reindex_like" operation has been replaced with a direct calculation of the "rs" series. This modification avoids the reindexing operation that was causing the "ValueError" due to duplicate axis in the index.
