Potential error location: The error might be inside the `data` and `rs` variables. Since these variables are of type Series, there might be some data mismatch or type issue happening during the division operation between them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by the mismatch in data types or incorrect calculations in the `pct_change` function, resulting in NaN or inf values being present in the output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensuring that the data in the Series object is of the same type and properly aligns with the calculation of percentage change.
2. Checking for any division by zero or unexpected values that might result in inf or NaN.

Code for the corrected function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=fill_method, limit=limit)  # Using pct_change method directly
    if freq is not None:  # Checking if freq is specified
        rs = rs.asfreq(freq)  # Apply freq if specified

    return rs
```
