The error message indicates that the problem occurs when trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates. This error is triggered by the `reindex_like` function, specifically when creating a new Series, which duplicates the date "2019-11-18".

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `pct_change` function, specifically in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `reindex_like` function is producing a new Series with duplicate values, which is not allowed.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the new Series produced by `reindex_like` does not contain duplicate values by considering the handling of the `freq` parameter when invoking `pct_change`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        
        if freq is not None:
            rs = rs.reindex(data.index, method=None)
        else:
            rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        
        if freq is None:
            mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```

In the corrected code, I added a condition to handle the `freq` parameter and adjust the reindexing operation accordingly. If `freq` is not None, it reindexes using the data index and sets the method to None. Otherwise, it reindexes like the original data.
