The error message indicates that there is an attempt to reindex using an axis with duplicates, which is not allowed.

Potential error location: The issue might be arising from the `reindex_like` method which tries to reindex `rs` similar to `data`. If `data` and `rs` have different indices, it can lead to trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `reindex_like` method is not handling duplicate indices properly when attempting to reindex `rs` similar to `data`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Before attempting to reindex `rs` similar to `data`, verify if `data` and `rs` have the same indices. If they do not, handle the duplicate indices appropriately.
2. Use the `drop_duplicates` method on the index before reindexing to ensure there are no duplicates.
3. It's also important to ensure that the index on which the reindexing operation is being performed is unique.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    
    # Ensure that the index of 'rs' is unique
    if not rs.index.is_unique:
        rs = rs.reindex(rs.index.drop_duplicates())

    # It's important to handle the case where 'freq' is None to avoid errors
    if freq is None and 'np' in globals():
        mask = pd.isna(rs.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
