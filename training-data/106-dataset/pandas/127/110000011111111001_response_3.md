The error message is indicating that there is an attempt to reindex data on an axis with duplicates, resulting in a ValueError. Looking at the function `pct_change`, we can see that the issue is likely related to the reindexing step (`rs.reindex_like(data)`).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the reindexing is being performed using a `DatetimeIndex` with duplicate values. This is causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `pct_change` function to handle the reindexing of the computed percentage change (`rs`) to avoid the duplication issue. We can achieve this by using the `series.index` attribute of the source data (`self`) to apply the correct index to the resulting percentage change series.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    # Reindex rs based on the index of the original data
    rs.index = self.index
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
