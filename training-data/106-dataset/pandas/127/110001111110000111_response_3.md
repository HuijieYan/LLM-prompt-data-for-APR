The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis. This suggests that the problem lies in the `pct_change` function, particularly in the `reindex_like` method.

The bug occurs because the `reindex_like` method is not handling duplicate indices properly, causing the ValueError to be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `reindex_like` method to handle duplicate indices gracefully. This can be done by checking if the index is unique, and if not, removing duplicate entries before reindexing.

The corrected code for the `pct_change` function is as follows:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs.index = data.index  # Set the index of rs to be the same as data
    mask = data.isna()  # Create a mask for NaN values in data
    rs[mask] = np.nan  # Set corresponding values in rs to NaN where data is NaN
    return rs
```

This corrected code sets the index of the resulting series `rs` to be the same as the index of the input data. It also creates a mask for NaN values in the input data and sets the corresponding values in `rs` to NaN where the input data is NaN.

With these modifications, the `pct_change` function should now handle duplicate indices correctly and not raise a ValueError.
