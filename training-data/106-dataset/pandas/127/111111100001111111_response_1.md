The code is throwing a ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis. This error occurs because the reindex_like method is trying to align the index of the result with the original data which may contain duplicate values in the index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the rs = rs.reindex_like(data) line, where reindex_like is attempting to align the index of the result with the original data.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the data index might not be unique, leading to the ValueError while trying to reindex the result with the same index.

To fix the bug, we can drop duplicate indices in the original data before calling the reindex_like method. This will ensure that the index is unique and resolving the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    data = data.loc[~data.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, before calling the reindex_like method, we have added the line `data = data.loc[~data.index.duplicated()]` to remove any duplicate indices in the original data before reindexing. This ensures that the index is unique and prevents the ValueError from occurring.
