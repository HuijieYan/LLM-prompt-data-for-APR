The bug in the `pct_change` function seems to be caused by the reindexing operation where the index contains duplicate values. This is consistent with the error message from the test function, which mentions "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" and the context of the test case which is related to reindexing.

One potential approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the index does not contain duplicate values before performing the reindexing operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if not data.index.is_unique:
        raise ValueError("Cannot reindex from a duplicate axis")
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = pd.isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, before reindexing the `rs` series, it checks if the index of `data` is unique. If it's not, it raises a `ValueError` similar to the one seen in the error message. This should prevent the reindexing from a duplicate axis and resolve the bug.
