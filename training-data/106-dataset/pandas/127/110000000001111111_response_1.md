The bug is located in the `pct_change` method in the `pandas` library. The error is occurring because when the `freq` parameter is set to 'BM' (business month end frequency) in the `pct_change` method, the reindexing operation fails due to duplicate axis.

This issue occurs because the `pct_change` method doesn't handle the 'BM' frequency properly, resulting in a ValueError due to reindexing from a duplicate axis.

To fix this bug, the `pct_change` method needs to be updated to handle the 'BM' frequency correctly. This can be done by modifying the reindexing operation to remove any duplicate axes before performing the reindexing.

Here is the corrected `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data, method='pad')
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

With this update, the reindexing operation (rs.reindex_like) now includes the `method='pad'` parameter, which handles the 'BM' frequency correctly and prevents the occurrence of duplicate axes, resolving the ValueError issue.
