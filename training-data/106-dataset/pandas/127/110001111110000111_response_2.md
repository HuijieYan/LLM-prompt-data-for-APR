The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis in the `pct_change` function. This suggests that the problem lies within the reindexing process of the `pct_change` function.

The problematic code seems to be causing this error due to reindexing with a duplicate axis. When the `pct_change` function is called with a frequency set, it performs a reindexing operation that results in the ValueError due to duplicate axis.

To fix this bug, the reindexing process needs to be adjusted to handle duplicate axis more effectively. Additionally, the method used for reindexing should be revised to avoid generating duplicate axis during reindexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    # drop duplicate axis before reindexing to avoid ValueError
    rs = rs.loc[:, ~rs.columns.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, before reindexing, we remove any duplicate axis to avoid the ValueError caused by reindexing with duplicate axis. This change should resolve the bug related to the `pct_change` function.
