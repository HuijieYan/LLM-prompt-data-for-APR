The error occurs at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` in the `pct_change` method because the `data` object has duplicate axis labels, which is not allowed in `reindex_like` method. This is evident from the test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` and the associated error message.

The bug occurred because the `data` object is not properly handled in the `pct_change` method, leading to potential duplicate axis labels. This causes the `reindex_like` method to raise a ValueError due to the presence of duplicate axis.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `data` object does not have duplicate axis labels. One possible approach for handling this issue is to use `asfreq` method to resample the time-series data to the specified frequency before applying the `pct_change` method.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.asfreq(freq).fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    return rs
```

By using the `asfreq` method to resample the time-series data to the specified frequency before applying the `fillna` method, we ensure that the `data` object does not have duplicate axis labels, thereby preventing the ValueError in the `reindex_like` method.
