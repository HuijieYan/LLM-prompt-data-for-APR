The error message shows that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis. This seems to be related to the pct_change function, specifically the line rs = rs.reindex_like(data).

The issue is likely occurring because when calculating the percentage change, the resulting series may have duplicate index values, and when trying to reindex it to be like the original data, it is causing a ValueError due to duplicate axis.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the reindexing logic to handle the case where the resulting series has duplicate index values. This could involve dropping duplicate index values before reindexing, or creating a new index for the resulting series that does not have duplicate values.

Below is the corrected code for the pct_change function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    # Instead of reindex_like, we handle duplicate index values explicitly
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated(keep='last')]
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, after calculating the percentage change, we explicitly handle duplicate index values by using loc to drop the duplicate index values from the resulting series before returning it. This should prevent the ValueError related to reindexing from a duplicate axis.
