The error message indicates that the "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" ValueError is being raised, which means the reindexing operation is being performed on an axis with duplicates.

Looking at the buggy function `pct_change`, the problematic line seems to be `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This line tries to reindex the result `rs` to be like the original data, which might be causing the issue since there are duplicate values in the index of the original data. 

The reason for the bug is that the `reindex_like` method is trying to create a new object with the same index as the original data, and since the original data's index contains duplicated values, the reindexing operation is causing a ValueError to be raised.

To fix this bug, you can drop the duplicate index values before reindexing the result `rs` to be like the data. This will prevent the ValueError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    # Drop duplicate index values from the result to avoid ValueError from reindexing
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]

    # Reindex the result to be like the data
    rs = rs.reindex(data.index)

    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)

    return rs
``` 

In the corrected code, after calculating `rs`, duplicate index values are dropped using `rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]`. Then, the result `rs` is reindexed to be like the original data using `rs.reindex(data.index)`. This approach ensures that the reindexing operation does not raise a ValueError due to duplicate index values.
