The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis within the `pct_change` function.

Looking at the function implementation, the issue could be caused by the `reindex_like` method where it tries to reindex using the same index as the original data. In the test case, the index contains duplicate values which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `pct_change` function to handle duplicate indexes. This can be done by sorting the index before reindexing to ensure that the index is unique.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.sort_index().reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By sorting the index before reindexing, we ensure that duplicate values are handled properly, and the function should now work without causing the "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error.
