Potential Error Location: The error might occur in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))` as the function `isna` is not defined within the current scope and `com` is not defined.

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. The function `isna` is being called without its proper definition.
2. The variable `com` is being used without being defined within the scope of the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `isna` function from the Pandas library by calling it with `self.isna()` instead of `isna()`.
2. It seems like `com` may be intended to refer to the current object, in which case it should be replaced with `self` or `data`.
3. Also, it seems that `com.values_from_object()` is meant to be `data.values`, which is used to extract the values from the Pandas object.

Corrected Code:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
