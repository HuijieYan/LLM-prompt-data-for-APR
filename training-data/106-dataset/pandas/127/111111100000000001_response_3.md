It seems that the problematic function is `pct_change` within the NDFrame class. The potential error location is the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))` as `isna` and `com` are not defined within the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to use `isna` and `com` within the `pct_change` function without defining or importing them. It seems like these were intended to be referencing methods or attributes of the class, but they are not properly referenced in this context.

To fix the bug, `isna` should be referenced using `self.isna()` and `com.values_from_object(data)` should be referenced using `self.values_from_object(data)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
