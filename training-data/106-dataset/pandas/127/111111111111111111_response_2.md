The error occurs in the function `pct_change` at the line `rs.reindex_like(data)`. The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" indicates that there are duplicate values in the index that is being passed to the `reindex_like` method.

The reason for the duplicate index values is likely due to the `pct_change` method not handling the frequency ('B') properly. This is causing duplicate index values when taking the percentage change based on the frequency.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the frequency parameter properly to ensure that the resulting index doesn't have duplicate values caused by the 'B' frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `pct_change`:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))

    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if freq is not None:
        data = data.asfreq(freq)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    return rs
```

In the corrected `pct_change` method, the `asfreq` method is used to handle the given frequency parameter. This should resolve the issue of duplicate index values and prevent the "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error from occurring.
