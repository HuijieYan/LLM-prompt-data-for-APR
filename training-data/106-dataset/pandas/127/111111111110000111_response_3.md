The error is occurring due to the `pct_change` method of the `NDFrame` class in the `pandas.core.generic` file. The error message suggests that the reindexing operation is trying to happen on a duplicate axis, leading to a ValueError.

The potential error in the code seems to be related to the way the reindexing is being performed in the `pct_change` method. It seems that the reindexing operation is not handling duplicate axis cases correctly.

The bug occurs because the pct_change method first fills NaN values in the data and then tries to reindex it. This may lead to duplicates in the index, causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the reindexing process should be handled in a way that duplicates in the index are managed appropriately. One way to handle this is to check for duplicate indices and handle them before the reindexing process.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method in the `NDFrame` class:

```python
# ... (other methods)

# Corrected pct_change method
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is not None:
        rs.index = data.index
    else:
        mask = data.isna()
        rs = rs.where(~mask, other=np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the reindexing operation and instead corrected the index assignment after the division operation.

This corrected code should resolve the issue of the `pct_change` method causing a ValueError related to reindexing from a duplicate axis.
