The bug is occurring in the `pct_change` method of the `NDFrame` class. The error message `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` is due to the reindexing of the `rs` Series.

The issue occurs because when `freq='BM'` is specified, and the data does not fit exactly into the frequency specified. So the reindexing operation results in duplicate axis labels, causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `pct_change` method to first resample the data to the specified frequency before applying the percentage change calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    data = self.asfreq(freq)
    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=fill_method, limit=limit, **kwargs)
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, we use the `asfreq` method to resample the data to the specified frequency before applying `pct_change`. This ensures that the data aligns properly with the frequency and eliminates the possibility of duplicate axis labels, fixing the bug.
