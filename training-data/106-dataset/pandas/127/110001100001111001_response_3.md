The pct_change method is designed to compute the percentage change between the current value and the previous value in a Series. The bug appears to be caused by multiple reasons, such as incorrect handling of missing values, divison by zero resulting in infinite values, and potential errors in reindexing.

To fix the bug, we can follow these approaches:
1. Check for and handle missing or NaN values properly during division.
2. Handle the division by zero error to prevent infinite values.
3. Ensure that the reindexing is performed correctly to align the result with the original data.

The corrected code for the pct_change method is as follows:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Determine the axis using the provided kwargs or the default axis
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.get("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    
    # Fill missing values using the specified method
    data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    # Compute the percentage change while handling division by zero
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / shifted_data
    if freq is None:
        rs = rs.mask(data.isna(), np.nan)  # Set NaN values to NaN in result
    
    # Reindex the result aligned with the original data
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    return rs
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `kwargs.get("axis", self._stat_axis_name)` to check if the "axis" key is present in the kwargs and provide the default axis if not.
2. The `data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs))` computation is simplified to `(data - shifted_data) / shifted_data` to handle division by zero.
3. We use the `mask` method to properly handle NaN values in the result.
4. We ensure reindexing is performed correctly with `rs.reindex_like(data)` to align the result with the original data.
