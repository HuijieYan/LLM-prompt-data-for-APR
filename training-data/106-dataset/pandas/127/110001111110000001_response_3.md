The error message indicates that the reindexing operation is being performed on an axis with duplicates, leading to a ValueError.

The issue likely lies in the pct_change function's reindexing operation. The rs = rs.reindex_like(data) line in the pct_change function is causing the problem.

The reason for the bug is that when pct_change is being calculated, it fills NaN values using the fillna method and initially set the axis based on certain conditions. However, during the reindexing operation, it causes a ValueError due to the presence of duplicate axes.

To fix the bug, the reindex_like function should be modified to handle duplicate axes or alternatively, a different approach to handle reindexing should be implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function pct_change:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
