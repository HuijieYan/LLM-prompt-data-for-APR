Potential Error:
The potential error in the pct_change function is the use of undefined variables such as _shared_docs, _shared_doc_kwargs, and com; as well as missing imports such as np.

Reasons for the Bug:
The error occurred because the variables _shared_docs, _shared_doc_kwargs, and com are not defined within the function, and the np module is not imported.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the undefined variables _shared_docs, _shared_doc_kwargs, and com within the function.
2. Import the necessary modules, such as np (assuming it refers to numpy).

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
