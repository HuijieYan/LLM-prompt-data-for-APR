The error seems to be related to the `reindex_like` method inside the `pct_change` function. The `reindex_like` method tries to reindex using `data` and `rs` (which is the result of a division operation). However, it appears that the operation generates duplicate indices, leading to the ValueError.

The `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` expression in the `pct_change` method seems to be the cause of the error. It is attempting to reindex `rs` based on the indices of `data`, and there seem to be duplicate indices causing the ValueError.

The reason for the bug seems to be related to how the `pct_change` method handles index reindexing. It is not properly handling the case where there are duplicate indices. This can occur when the division operation produces NaN values, leading to duplicate indices in the result.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle the case of duplicate indices in the `rs` Series. This can be done by resetting the index before performing the reindexing. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle NaN values in a specific way to avoid duplicate indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)  # Reset the index to avoid duplicate indices
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)  # Reindex after resetting the index
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
