Potential error location:
The potential error location within the `pct_change` function is in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. It seems that the `isna` function and `com.values_from_object` method are being called without referencing the correct prefix or module.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the `isna` function and `com.values_from_object` method are not properly referenced within the `pct_change` function. This can lead to NameError or AttributeError if the correct prefix or module is not used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `isna` is a method within the class, use `self.isna()` to call it.
2. If `com.values_from_object` is a method from another class, an instance of that class needs to be created and the method called using the correct instance.
3. If `com.values_from_object` is a static method or a method from a different module, use the correct module prefix to call the method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)  # Changed method to value
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()  # Used self to call the isna method
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
