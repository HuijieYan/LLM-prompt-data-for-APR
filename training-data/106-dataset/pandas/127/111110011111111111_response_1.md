The error occurs when the `pct_change` method is called with the `freq` parameter set to 'B'. This causes the underlying code to throw a ValueError with the message "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis."

The bug is located in the `pct_change` method where there is a call to `rs.reindex_like(data)` and the subsequent operations that follow. The issue arises due to a duplicate axis being present in the code, causing the reindexing to fail.

To fix the bug, the reindexing process needs to be updated to handle duplicate axes properly. This can be achieved by ensuring that the reindexing process can handle duplicate axes without causing an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By removing the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` and adjusting the subsequent operations, the error related to reindexing from a duplicate axis should be resolved.
