The error occurs in the `pct_change` function at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This error is raised because the `reindex_like` function is trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates. 

This issue occurs because the `pct_change` function is trying to reindex the result `rs` to be like the original data, but the original data contains duplicate indices. This causes the reindexing operation to fail and raise a `ValueError`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `pct_change` function to handle the duplicate indices appropriately. We can simply remove the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` and return the result `rs` without the reindexing operation, as it is not necessary.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` function:

```python
# corrected function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    return rs
```
