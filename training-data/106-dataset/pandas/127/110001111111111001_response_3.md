The error message indicates that the issue is related to reindexing from a duplicate axis. Looking at the runtime values, the problematic function seems to be `pct_change`, specifically the line that reads `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`.

The error occurs because after dividing and shifting the data, the index becomes longer due to the frequency parameter used in `data.div` and `data.shift`. When `reindex_like` is called, it is attempting to reindex with an axis that contains duplicates, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to align the indices in the `pct_change` function and ensure that the resulting index does not contain duplicates. One approach is to use the `dropna()` method on the result series to remove NaN values that may have been created due to the shifting, as these NaN values could contribute to an increase in the length of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.dropna()  # Drop NaN values to avoid increasing index length
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
