The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis when using the `pct_change` method with the `freq='BM'` parameter. The bug is likely occurring within the `pct_change` method.

The reason behind the bug is that when the `freq='BM'` parameter is used, it results in duplicate indices, which causes the reindexing issue and the subsequent ValueError.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to modify the `pct_change` method to handle the reindexing issue with duplicate axes. One way to address this issue is to remove duplicate indices before performing reindexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    
    return rs
```

This corrected code includes the line `rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]`, which removes any duplicate indices from the resulting series.

With this corrected code, the `pct_change` method should now handle the reindexing issue with duplicate axes and no longer throw a ValueError when using `freq='BM'`.
