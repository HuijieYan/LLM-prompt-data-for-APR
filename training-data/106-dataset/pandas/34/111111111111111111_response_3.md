The error occurs when the `groupby` method is called on the `dataframe` using `pd.Grouper(freq='1D').mean()` to group the data by day. This error arises because on a long clock-change day in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. The `pd.Grouper` does not handle this ambiguity properly, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. The method is not able to handle the ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to modify the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class to handle ambiguous time during the clock change day in Cuba. The `date_range` function needs to be modified to handle this specific case by appropriately addressing the ambiguous time issue. Additionally, the frequency and time zones should be taken into account when creating the bins and labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="shift_forward",  # Handle ambiguous time by shifting it forward
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these modifications, the `_get_time_bins` function should now be able to handle ambiguous times during the clock change day in Cuba, preventing the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring.
