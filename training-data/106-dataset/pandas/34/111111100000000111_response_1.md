The problem reported in the GitHub issue is related to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when using the `pd.Grouper` function with daily frequency on a day with a clock change in Cuba.

The error message "AmbiguousTimeError" indicates that there is an issue with handling ambiguous timestamps, specifically on days with clock changes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class. More specifically, the issue seems to be related to the calculation of the `first` and `last` bin edges using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` function.

The bug occurs because the `first` and `last` bin edges are not correctly adjusted for days with ambiguous timestamps, resulting in the "AmbiguousTimeError."

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle ambiguous timestamps when calculating the `first` and `last` bin edges. This can be achieved by utilizing the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` methods to ensure that ambiguous timestamps on clock change days are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_localized = ax.tz_localize(None).tz_convert(ax.tz)
    first = ax_localized.min()
    last = ax_localized.max()

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, pd.NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, pd.NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `ax` is localized and converted to ensure correct handling of ambiguous timestamps on days with clock changes. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket regarding the daily frequency failing with an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in Cuba.
