1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method and expects the result to be `False`. However, when the test is run, it fails and asserts that `True` is not equal to `False`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class does not compare the data in the dataframes correctly, leading to incorrect results when the method is called.

4. To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to compare the content of the dataframes appropriately. This may involve iterating over the blocks in each dataframe and comparing their content to determine if the dataframes are equal.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(self_blocks[i], other_blocks[i]) for i in range(len(self_blocks))
    )
```

This corrected code iterates over the blocks in each dataframe and uses the `assert_frame_equal` function from the pandas testing module to compare the content of the blocks and determine if the dataframes are equal.
