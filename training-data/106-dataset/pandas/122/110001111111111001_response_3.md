This appears to be an issue with the function `equals` in the `pandas` library. The `equals` function is used to check if two dataframe objects are equal. In the provided function, there are some issues with the variable naming and comparisons. The immediate issue is with the use of `self` as a variable name within the function. The `self` variable is commonly used as a reference to the instance of the current class, but in this context, it is being used as a parameter.

Additionally, the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is not comparing the expected values, resulting in the assertion error.

One possible approach to resolving this issue is by writing a correct comparison statement within the function. 

Below is the corrected `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self, other
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected code, `self` and `other` are used to directly access the instance properties. Additionally, the comparison at the end of the function is made using the correct conditions.
