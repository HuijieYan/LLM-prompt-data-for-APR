1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`. However, the test fails with an assertion error because `df1.equals(df2)` returns `True`.

2. The potential error location within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is the comparison of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. 

3. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly comparing the blocks to determine if they are equal. Instead, it's comparing the manager locations of the blocks, which could be different even if the content of the blocks is the same.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to compare the content of the blocks directly, rather than their manager locations. This can be achieved by using the `values` attribute of the blocks to compare their actual content.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
# Add this corrected code to the BlockManager class in pandas/core/internals/managers.py

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def content_equals(block, oblock):
        return np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.values))
    return all(
        content_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function now compares the content of the blocks directly using the `values` attribute and ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly recognized as equal.
