The error message demonstrates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `equals` method is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is that it is incorrectly sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on block type and location, causing the comparison to fail when it should not.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `equals` method is erroneously sorting the blocks by type and location, leading to incorrect comparison results.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the block sorting and compare the blocks directly without sorting based on type and location.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```
This corrected method directly compares the blocks without sorting, which should resolve the issue.
