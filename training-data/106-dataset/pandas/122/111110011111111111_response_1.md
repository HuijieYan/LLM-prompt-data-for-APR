The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two dataframes are equal, which is expected to return False. However, the test is failing because the `equals` method incorrectly returns True.

The potential error location within the `equals` method is the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` after they have been sorted using the `canonicalize` function. The function `canonicalize` is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it seems to be missing the `block` parameter in its definition. This is causing the comparison to return True even when the blocks have different locations.

The bug occurs because the `equals` method does not handle the case where blocks have the same type and dtype, but different locations. As a result, the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` returns True even when the blocks have different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to accept the `block` parameter and use it to compare the blocks based on their locations in addition to their dtype names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
