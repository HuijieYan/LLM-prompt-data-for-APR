The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` is checking if two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, are not equal by using the `equals()` method. However, the error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, returning `assert True is False`.

The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class. The issue lies within the `equals()` function, which is incorrectly sorting the blocks and comparing them.

The bug occurs because the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function does not correctly handle cases where the data types of the columns differ between the two DataFrames. This leads to incorrect comparison results when the DataFrames have columns of different data types.

To fix this bug, the sorting of blocks should be modified to properly handle cases where the data types of the columns differ between the two DataFrames. Additionally, the comparison should consider the data type differences between the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), str(block.dtype))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the data type of the block and updating the sorting logic to consider block data types, the corrected `equals()` function should now handle cases where the data types of the blocks differ between the two DataFrames.
