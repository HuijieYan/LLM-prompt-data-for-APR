The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values for columns 'a' and 'b'. It then calls the `equals` method to check if the two dataframes are equal, and expects it to return False.

The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing with the message `assert True is False`. This indicates that the `equals` method is returning True incorrectly, when it should have returned False.

Upon inspecting the function `equals`, the potential error location is the comparison of the DataFrame blocks using the `equals` method within the `canonicalize` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks using a predefined rule and then compares them using the `equals` method. However, the `equals` method itself has some issues, leading to the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method can be rewritten to handle the comparison of DataFrames correctly, ensuring that the comparison considers the data within the blocks while also considering block locations and types.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function addresses the incorrect comparison of DataFrame blocks within the `canonicalize` function and ensures that the `equals` method behaves as expected when comparing two DataFrames.
