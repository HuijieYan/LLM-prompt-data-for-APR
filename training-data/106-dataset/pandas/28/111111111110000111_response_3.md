The test case `test_cat_different_classes` aims to concatenate elements from two different data types. In this case, it is concatenating a `pd.Series` with a `pd.Index`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `assert_series_equal` function, specifically with the comparison of the indexes.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue originates from the `_get_series_list` function within the `StringMethods` class. There is a discrepancy when handling the input `others` if it is an instance of `pd.Index`.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` function does not handle `pd.Index` as a valid input type properly. When `others` is an instance of `pd.Index`, the function returns NaN values instead of concatenating the elements correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` function needs to be updated to handle `pd.Index` as a valid input type. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of 'others' should be revised to ensure that the correct behavior is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index
    
    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others.values, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(isinstance(x, str) for x in others):  # Handling list-like containing only strings
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
            
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_get_series_list` function should be able to handle `pd.Index` properly and avoid the bug where NaN values were being returned when concatenating elements.
