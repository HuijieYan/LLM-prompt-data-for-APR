The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_series_list` function which is called by the `str.cat` method. The function is responsible for converting the `others` input into a list of Series.

The error seems to be happening because when `others` is an Index, the function does not handle it properly, resulting in NaN values in the concatenated result.

It appears that the function is not properly handling the case when `others` is an Index. The code doesn't have a specific check for this case and may be treating the Index as a list-like object incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for the Index case and handle it appropriately. We can create a separate condition to handle the case when `others` is an Index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others.values, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added a specific condition for handling the case when `others` is an Index. We convert the Index to a Series using its `.values` attribute and setting the index to the existing index of the calling Series/Index.
