The bug in the `_get_series_list` function seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the input types. The function is designed to accept a variety of input types like Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like objects, and transform them into a list of Series. However, the handling of these different input types seems to be causing the bug.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect type checking and conversion of the `others` variable into a list of Series. The function seems to be treating the `others` input as an iterable, and then attempting to handle it differently based on the types of its elements. The bugs could be occurring due to incorrect indexing, looping, and type checking within the function.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_series_list` should be designed to consistently handle the different types of inputs. This may involve explicit type checking and conversion of input types into a uniform format for further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    
    idx = self._orig.index if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
    
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others.iloc[:, i] for i in range(others.shape[1])]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        others = Series(others, index=idx)
        return [others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # Convert all elements to Series
        return [Series(x, index=idx) for x in others]
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like")
```

In this corrected code, we handle the different input types consistently by converting them into a list of Series using explicit type checking and conversion. This should resolve the bugs and make the function more robust.
