The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_series_list` function, specifically when the input `others` is an instance of the `pd.Index` class. The function is not handling the case where `others` is an Index and as a result, it is returning NaN values instead of the expected concatenated values.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not have a condition to handle the case when `others` is an Index. As a result, it falls through the conditional statements and reaches the `raise TypeError` statement, producing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `others` is an Index. We can modify the `_get_series_list` function to check for the type of `others` and construct the list of Series accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
    
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case when `others` is an Index and produce the expected output for the `str.cat` method.
