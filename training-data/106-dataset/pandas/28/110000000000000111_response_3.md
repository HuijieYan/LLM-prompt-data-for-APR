The error occurs when the `others` parameter is an Index. The function should handle this case properly but it currently returns NaNs instead of concatenating the values from the Index with the calling Series.

The potential error location in the function is within the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):` block, where it attempts to transform the Index into a Series.

The bug occurs because the function fails to properly handle the case when `others` is an Index, causing it to return NaNs instead of the expected concatenated values.

To fix the bug, the function should first convert the Index to a Series with the same index as the calling Series, and then concatenate the two Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]  # Convert Index to Series with same index as calling Series
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
```

By converting the Index to a Series with the same index as the calling Series, the function should now properly handle the case when `others` is an Index and return the expected concatenated values instead of NaNs.
