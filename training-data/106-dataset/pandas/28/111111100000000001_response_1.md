The error in the given function is that it is improperly handling the input parameter "others" and not returning the correct output based on the input type. The function is supposed to transform input "others" into a list of Series, but it's not doing so effectively.

The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the function is not handling the various possible types of the "others" input parameter correctly. For example, when "others" is a list-like object, the code is not properly iterating through it and creating a list of Series as required.

One approach for fixing the bug would be to rewrite the conditional logic to handle each type of input parameter separately. Additionally, the recursion and iteration through the list-like "others" should be fixed.

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        los = []
        for item in others:
            if isinstance(item, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(item, np.ndarray) and item.ndim == 1):
                los.append(item)
            elif not is_list_like(item):
                los.append(Series(item, index=idx))
            else:
                raise TypeError("Invalid type in list-like 'others'")
        return los

    raise TypeError("Invalid type for 'others'")
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through the list-like "others" and appends the appropriate series to the list based on the type of the element. This ensures that the function returns the correct output for a given input.
