Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `_get_series_list` method in the `StringMethods` class, as it is not handling the `others` parameter properly when it is an Index.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method does not handle the case where `others` is an Index correctly. As a result, when `others` is an Index, it produces NaNs instead of the expected output.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of `others` and handle the case when it is an Index appropriately.
2. Convert the Index to a list of values and then process it similar to a list or numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic method `_get_series_list`:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    idx = self._orig.index  # Get the index of the calling Series/Index
    
    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        if all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1) for x in others):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like.")
```

In the corrected code, the method now checks if `others` is an instance of Index and handles it appropriately by converting it to a series.
