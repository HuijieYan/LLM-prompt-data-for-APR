The error message indicates that there is an issue with the index class when trying to execute the test for the `test_cat_different_classes` function. This might be related to the internal logic of the `_get_series_list` function.

The potential error location within the `_get_series_list` function is likely to be in the logic that handles the different types of input for the `others` parameter.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` function does not handle all the different types of inputs correctly. It does not appropriately convert different input types into a list of Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_series_list` function to correctly handle different input types and convert them into a list of Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple)):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1):
                los.append(x)
            elif isinstance(x, str):
                los.append(Series(others, index=self._orig.index))
            else:
                raise TypeError("Invalid type in the input list")
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid type for others")
```

With these corrections, the `_get_series_list` function should now properly handle different input types and convert them into a list of Series, resolving the issue encountered in the test.
