The `test_cat_different_classes` test function is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual values of the `result` and `expected` Series.

The issue is likely in the `_get_series_list` function, specifically when processing the `klass` parameter and converting it into a list of Series.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `klass` parameter. The function `_get_series_list` is not correctly processing different types of input provided by the `klass` parameter, leading to the mismatch in the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` function should be modified to handle different types of input provided by the `klass` parameter correctly. Each type of input should be processed accordingly to convert it into a list of Series.

Below is the corrected `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if len(others) != len(self._orig):
            raise ValueError("Length of input must match the length of the calling Series/Index")
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Input type not supported")
```

By appropriately handling different types of input in the `_get_series_list` function, the issue with the `test_cat_different_classes` test function should be resolved.
