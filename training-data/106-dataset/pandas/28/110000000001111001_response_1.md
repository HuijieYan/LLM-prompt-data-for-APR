The code is a method from a class that takes the self variable as an argument. From the code, it is apparent that the bug arises due to the incorrect handling of a specific condition in the if-elif-else block. Specifically, the issue arises from the handling of the 'others' variable in the first few condition checks.

Based on the analysis of the function, the code is intended to process different types of input and return them as a list of series. However, in the current implementation, the 'others' variable is not being correctly transformed into a list of Series in certain cases, leading to TypeErrors being raised.

To address this issue, we can make the following corrections to the code:
1. Ensure that when 'others' is a list or tuple, it is correctly converted to a list of Series.
2. Make sure that 'others' is correctly handled when it is an ndarray as well.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_series_list method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:  # not elif, since the type of 'others' might be different
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [Series(others[x], index=idx) for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):  # fix the condition to check for lists and tuples
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        return [Series(o, index=idx) for o in others]  # create a series for each element in 'others'

    # Handle other cases
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```
