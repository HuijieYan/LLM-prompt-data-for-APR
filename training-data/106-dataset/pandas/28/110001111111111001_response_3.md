The test case `test_cat_different_classes` is using the `pd.Index` class as an input parameter for the `klass` parameter, and it's expected to concatenate the strings from the `pd.Series` with the strings from the `pd.Index` class. The error message indicates that the classes for the series index are different: `Index([0, 1, 2], dtype='object')` (left) and `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)` (right).

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the input parameter `others` depending on its class type. This section should correctly handle the case when `others` is of the type `pd.Index` to match the behavior expected in the test.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly handle the case when `others` is of the type `pd.Index`. It treats `pd.Index` differently than `pd.Series` and doesn't convert it into a list of Series before processing.

To fix the bug, the `others` parameter should be handled based on its type. When it's of type `pd.Index`, it needs to be converted to a list of Series before further processing.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # Handle pd.Index type by converting it to a list of Series
    if isinstance(others, Index):
        others = [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]

    # Continue handling the other types as before
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        # ... (rest of the original code remains the same)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the input parameter `others` when it is of type `pd.Index`, converting it into a list of Series before further processing. This should address the issue encountered in the test case.
