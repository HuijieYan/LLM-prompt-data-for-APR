The error occurs in the test function `test_cat_different_classes` when the `klass` parameter is an instance of the `pd.Index` class. The error message indicates that there's a mismatch between the classes of the left and right objects being compared.

The potential error location within the `_get_series_list` function is when the input `others` is of type `pd.Index`. In this case, the function should transform it into a list of Series with the index parameter being set to the passed `pd.Index`.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the `pd.Index` class correctly. The function wrongly assumes that `pd.Index` is being treated as a list-like object, which leads to the mismatch in the classes of the left and right objects during comparison.

To fix the bug, you can modify the section of the `_get_series_list` function that handles the `pd.Index` class to correctly transform it into a list of Series with the index parameter being set to the passed `pd.Index`. Additionally, the condition for handling `pd.Index` should be added to the appropriate place in the function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
