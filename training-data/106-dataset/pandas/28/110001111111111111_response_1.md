The error occurs in the `_get_series_list` function, which is called by the `str.cat` method. The issue is that when `others` is passed as an Index, the function does not handle it properly, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` function does not have a specific case for handling the `Index` class in the parameter `others`. This results in the incorrect handling of the input, leading to the unexpected behavior in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` function should include a specific case to handle the `Index` class in the parameter `others`. This case should ensure that when `others` is an `Index`, it is transformed into a Series before further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._data, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With the corrected code, the function now properly handles the case where `others` is an `Index`, transforming it into a Series with the correct index before further processing. This should resolve the bug encountered in the test case.
