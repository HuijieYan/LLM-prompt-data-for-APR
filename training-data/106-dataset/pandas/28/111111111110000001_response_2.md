The test case `test_cat_different_classes` is trying to concatenate a Series `s` with another sequence `klass(["x", "y", "z"])`. The expected result is a new Series with the elements concatenated element-wise. 

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the index of the resulting Series.

Looking at the function `_get_series_list` within the `StringMethods` class, it seems that the issue may be related to how the index of the new Series is handled in certain cases.

The bug occurs because the function `_get_series_list` is not handling the combination of different types (`pd.Series`, `pd.Index`, etc.) properly and does not check for the expected output type.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to ensure that the index is handled correctly and returned in a consistent manner.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_series_list` is as follows:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, pd.Index):
        return [Series(others.values, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and len(others.shape) == 2:
        new_df = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [new_df[x] for x in new_df]
    elif pd.api.types.is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(isinstance(x, (Series, pd.Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and len(x.shape) == 1) for x in others):
            los = []
            for other in others:
                los.extend(self._get_series_list(other))
            return los
        elif all(not pd.api.types.is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like")
```

With this corrected code, the function now correctly handles different types of input and ensures the index is preserved or adjusted accordingly.
