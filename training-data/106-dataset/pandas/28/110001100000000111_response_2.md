The bug occurs in the `_get_series_list` function when the input `others` is an Index. This causes the `str.cat` method to produce NaNs instead of concatenating the strings correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_get_series_list` function does not handle the case when `others` is an Index. It only handles the cases for a Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like inputs.

To fix this bug, we can add a new condition to check if `others` is an instance of `ABCSeries` and return it as a list. Since `Index` is a subclass of `ABCSeries`, this condition will handle the case when `others` is an Index.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_28/pandas/core/strings.py

# ... previous code ...

# this is the corrected function to fix the bug
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # handling the case when others is an Index
    if isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    
    # rest of the code remains the same

```

With this correction, the `_get_series_list` function will now handle the case when `others` is an Index, and the `str.cat` method will produce the correct result when `others` is an Index.
