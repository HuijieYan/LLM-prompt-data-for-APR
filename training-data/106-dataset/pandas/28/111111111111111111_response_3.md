The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `Index` class. The `others` parameter being passed to the `str.cat` function is an instance of `pd.Index`, and the error message suggests that there is an issue with equality between different classes of indexes.

The error is likely occurring inside the `_get_series_list` function, where the `idx` variable is set based on the type of the input `others`. It appears that the function is not handling the case where `others` is an `Index` type correctly, leading to the equality assertion error during the test.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of input data. When `others` is an `Index` type, the code does not transform it correctly into a list of Series.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that when `others` is an `Index` type, it gets transformed correctly into a list of Series that matches the length of the calling `Series/Index`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig.index if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._data, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like")
```

The corrected code is more explicit in handling the different cases of input types and ensures that when `others` is an `Index` type, it is transformed into a list of Series with the correct index.
