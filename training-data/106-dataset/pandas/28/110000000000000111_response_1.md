The bug occurs when the `others` parameter is an Index, which leads to NaNs being produced instead of the expected concatenation result. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):` block, where it is returning a list containing a Series created from the Index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `others` is an Index properly.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code inside the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):` block to handle the Index appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._data, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):` block has been modified to create a Series from the Index using `Series(others._data, index=idx)` so that the Index is handled properly.
