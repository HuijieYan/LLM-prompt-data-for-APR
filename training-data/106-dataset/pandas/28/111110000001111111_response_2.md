The bug seems to be occurring in the `_get_series_list` method of the `StringMethods` class. The method is used to transform the input data into a list of Series, while handling different types of input data such as Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like, etc.

The bug occurs because when `others` is an Index, the method fails to handle it properly, leading to incorrect results. The bug seems to be related to the elif condition `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):`, where it tries to create a Series from the Index without handling the data properly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `others` is an Index and transform it into a Series correctly. We should also ensure that all the different types of input data are handled properly and transformed into a list of Series as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)

        # handle other list-like input data types
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif isinstance(x, str):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
        return los

    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like "
        "(either containing only strings or containing only objects of type Series/Index/np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case when `others` is an Index by creating a Series from it with the proper index. We also added handling for different list-like input data types to ensure they are transformed into a list of Series as expected.
