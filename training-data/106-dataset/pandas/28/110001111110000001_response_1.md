The error occurs when the `test_cat_different_classes` function is executed. The error message suggests that the Index classes are not equivalent, causing the `assert_series_equal` assertion to fail.

The bug in the `_get_series_list` function is likely causing the test failure. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of input passed to the `str.cat` method. The incorrect handling of `klass` in the test function could be leading to mismatched types, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` function needs to be modified to handle the input types correctly. Specifically, the dtype and index should be handled properly to avoid the mismatch.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # handle different input types properly
    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, np.ndarray)) and isinstance(others[0], str):
        idx = self._orig.index if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and len(others.shape) == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, np.ndarray)):
        los = []
        for item in others:
            los = los + self._get_series_list(item)
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like, "
            "or list-like of objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim)"
        )
``` 

This corrected function takes into account the different possible types of input and processes them accordingly.
