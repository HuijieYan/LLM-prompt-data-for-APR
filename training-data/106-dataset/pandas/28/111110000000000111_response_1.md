The bug is occurring in the `_get_series_list` method of the `StringMethods` class, specifically in the block of code that handles the case when `others` is an instance of `ABCIndexClass`.

The bug results from the function not handling the case where `others` is an Index properly and causing the `str.cat` method to produce NaNs. This is because the function does not correctly transform the Index into a list of Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_series_list` method to properly handle the case when `others` is an Index. We can create a new Series from the Index and return it as a list of Series in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).
    
    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    # Generally speaking, all objects without an index inherit the index
    # `idx` of the calling Series/Index - i.e. must have matching length.
    # Objects with an index (i.e. Series/Index/DataFrame) keep their own.
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    # ... (other cases remain the same)
```
