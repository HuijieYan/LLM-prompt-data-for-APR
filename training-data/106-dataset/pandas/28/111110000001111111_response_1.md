The bug is likely in the conditional statements that check for the type of `others` and return a list of Series based on the type. The bug seems to occur when `others` is an Index, resulting in unexpected behavior when using the `str.cat` method.

The issue is likely occurring because when `others` is an Index, it is not being handled correctly in the conditional statements. This results in the creation of NaNs instead of concatenating the strings as expected.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to handle the case when `others` is an Index properly. We can create a separate condition to handle Index objects and ensure that they are converted to a list of strings before processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others.values, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case when `others` is an Index correctly and should not produce NaNs when used with the `str.cat` method.
