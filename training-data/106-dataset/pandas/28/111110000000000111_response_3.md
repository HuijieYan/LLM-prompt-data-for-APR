The bug is likely occurring in the `_get_series_list` function, which is used by the `str.cat` method. The bug causes the `str.cat` method to produce NaNs when `others` is an Index.

The reason behind this bug is likely due to a conditional statement within the `_get_series_list` function that mishandles the case when `others` is an Index. This leads to unexpected behavior and produces NaNs instead of the expected output.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement handling the case when `others` is an Index needs to be corrected to ensure that the proper data transformations are applied to avoid producing NaNs.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others.to_list())]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)

        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```
