The error message from the test function is related to the `str.cat` method. The error indicates a problem with the comparison of index classes, suggesting that the bug might be related to `others` being an Index.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location in the `_get_series_list` function is the handling of the `others` input when it is an Index.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` function does not handle the case when `others` is an Index properly. It only checks for instances of `ABCIndexClass` and `ABCSeries`, but it does not handle the case where `others` is an Index in a pandas Series.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for the scenario where `others` is an Index and create a new Series from it using a similar approach as when `others` is a Series or a numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this correction, the `_get_series_list` function will now properly handle the case when `others` is an Index, allowing the `str.cat` method to work correctly with different types of inputs. This should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: str.cat produces NaNs when others is an Index."
