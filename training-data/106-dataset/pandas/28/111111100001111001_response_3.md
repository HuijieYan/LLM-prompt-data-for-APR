The bug in the given function is caused by the conditional statements used to determine the type of the 'others' input variable. The function checks for different types of input, and the logic for handling each type has issues.

The potential error location is in the conditional statements that check the type of 'others' and try to handle them accordingly.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the different types of 'others' input more accurately, based on the specific type of the input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    if isinstance(others, (Series, Index)):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        df = DataFrame(others)
        return [df[x] for x in df.columns]
    elif hasattr(others, '__iter__') and all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for x in others):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            los.extend(self._get_series_list(x))
        return los
    elif all(not hasattr(x, '__iter__') for x in others):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like")
```

In this corrected code:
- We have handled the specific types of 'others' input more accurately, based on the types of the input.
- We have used the 'isinstance()' function to check for the type of the 'others' input and handle them accordingly.
- The code now correctly handles Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like inputs, and raises a TypeError for any other type of input.
