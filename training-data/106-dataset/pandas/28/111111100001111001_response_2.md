The `others` variable in the `_get_series_list` method is checked for its type using multiple `isinstance` checks, and then the condition depends on whether the variable is an instance of certain classes and the dimensions of the `others` ndarray. Additionally, the use of `others.pop(0)` is not appropriate as `others` is a tuple or list. 

The bug occurs because the method does not consider all the possible valid types of the `others` variable, and the handling of the `ndarray` may not be appropriate for the given context.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition checking for instances of Series, Index, and DataFrame to account for all valid types of `others`.
2. Consider using the `others` variable directly without modifying it by calling `pop(0)` on it as `others` can be a list or tuple.

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig.index if isinstance(self._orig, Series) else self._orig
    
    if isinstance(others, Series) or isinstance(others, Index):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple)):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, Series) or isinstance(x, Index):
                los.append(x)
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif isinstance(x, str):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            else:
                raise TypeError("Invalid type in others.")
        return los
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid type in others.")
