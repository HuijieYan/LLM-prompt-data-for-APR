The potential error in the provided function is the handling of the `others` input parameter. The function is trying to handle various types of input data, such as Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like, etc., and transform them into a list of Series. However, the current implementation is complex and may not cover all cases properly.

There are a few potential issues with the current implementation:
1. The condition checks for different types (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass, ABCDataFrame) may not cover all possible input types, leading to potential errors.
2. The recursive call to `_get_series_list` within the loop is appending the result to the `los` list, which may not be the desired behavior.
3. The error message for the `raise` statement does not accurately describe the valid input types, which could lead to confusion for users.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the function and handle the input types more systematically. We can check the type of the input and convert it into a list of Series accordingly. If the input is already a Series, we can directly return it as a list. If the input is a DataFrame, we can iterate through its columns and convert each column into a Series. For other input types, we can check if they are list-like, and then convert them into a list of Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
        from pandas import Series, DataFrame
        
        idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
        series_list = []
        
        if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
            series_list.append(others)
        elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
            for column in others:
                series_list.append(others[column])
        elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
            df = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
            for column in df:
                series_list.append(df[column])
        elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
            for item in others:
                if isinstance(item, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(item, np.ndarray) and item.ndim == 1):
                    series_list.append(Series(item, index=idx))
                elif not is_list_like(item):
                    series_list.append(Series(item, index=idx))
                else:
                    raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like containing only valid types")
        else:
            raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like containing only valid types")
        
        return series_list
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic and handles different input types more systematically, ensuring that the output is always a list of Series based on the input data.
