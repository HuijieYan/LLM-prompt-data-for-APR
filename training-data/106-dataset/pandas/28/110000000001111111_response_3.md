The bug is likely occurring in the section where the function checks the type of `others` and processes it accordingly. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles `others` when it is an Index.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the case when `others` is an Index properly, which is causing unexpected behavior when used as input to `str.cat`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the case when `others` is an Index correctly, and returns the expected result as mentioned in the expected output.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
        # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        # ... or just strings
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
``` 

With this corrected function, the bug should be fixed and the expected output for the test cases should be obtained.
