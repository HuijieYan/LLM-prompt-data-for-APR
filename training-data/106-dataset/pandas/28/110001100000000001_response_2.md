The potential error location in the code is the use of the `self._get_series_list` method in the line `los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))`. This creates an infinite recursion as the method calls itself within the method.

The reason for the bug is that the `_get_series_list` method is being called recursively without any base case or condition to stop the recursion. This leads to an infinite loop and eventually causes a "maximum recursion depth" error.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the recursive call to the `_get_series_list` method and refactor the logic to use iteration instead.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1):
                los.append(x)
            elif not is_list_like(x):
                return [Series(others, index=idx)]
            else:
                raise TypeError(
                    "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
                    "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
                    "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
                    "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
                )
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
            "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
            "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
            "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
        )
```
