The error message originates from the test function `test_cat_different_classes`, where the error occurs in the assertion of series equality between the `result` and `expected` values. The error indicates that the series indices are different and not equivalent.

The root cause of this issue lies in the `_get_series_list` method of the `StringMethods` class. The method is expecting `others` to be of type `Series`, `DataFrame`, `np.ndarray`, or list-like objects. However, when an `Index` object is passed to this method, it fails to handle it properly, resulting in the error when using the `str.cat` method.

To fix this bug, the `_get_series_list` method needs to be modified to handle the case where `others` is an `Index` object correctly. It should convert the `Index` into a `Series` and handle it accordingly.

Corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index
    
    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)

    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With the corrected `_get_series_list` method, the bug should be fixed, and the `str.cat` method should no longer produce NaNs when `others` is an `Index`.
