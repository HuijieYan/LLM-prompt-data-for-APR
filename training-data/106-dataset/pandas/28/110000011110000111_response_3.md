Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_get_series_list` method where it is unable to handle the case when `others` is an Index.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method does not handle the case when `others` is an Index properly. This results in NaNs being produced when `others` is an Index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the type of `others` being an Index and handle it appropriately in the `_get_series_list` method.
2. Convert the Index to a Series before processing it in the `_get_series_list` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
    
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass): # Handling Index case
        return [Series(others._values, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```
By adding a specific case for handling when `others` is an Index, the bug should be resolved, and NaNs should no longer be produced when `others` is an Index.
