The error message suggests that the bug is related to the Series Index classes not being equivalent. It occurs when using the `str.cat` method with an Index as the `others` parameter. This leads to incorrect results, producing NaNs instead of the expected concatenated values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional branches that handle different types of input for the `others` parameter.

The bug occurs because the conditional branches in the `_get_series_list` function do not handle the input of Index correctly, leading to incorrect handling of the `others` parameter when it is an Index.

To fix the bug, the conditional branches in the `_get_series_list` function need to be modified to handle the case when the input `others` parameter is an Index. This modification should ensure that the Index is correctly converted into a list of Series to be used in the `str.cat` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, Index

    idx = self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) for x in others):
            return [x if isinstance(x, Series) else Series(x, index=idx) for x in others]
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, or list-like containing only Series or Index objects"
    )
```

This corrected code accounts for the different types of input for the `others` parameter, including the case when it is an Index. It correctly converts the Index into a list of Series with the appropriate index, ensuring that the `str.cat` operation produces the expected results.
