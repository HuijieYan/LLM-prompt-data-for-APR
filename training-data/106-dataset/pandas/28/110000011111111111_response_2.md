The error occurs when using an Index as the 'others' parameter in the `str.cat` function. The issue is with the `_get_series_list` method which is not handling Index objects correctly, leading to a mismatch in the resulting Series index.

The bug is occurring because the `_get_series_list` method is not properly handling Index objects. When the 'others' parameter is an Index, the method should convert it into a Series with the same values and the original index of the calling Series/Index. However, the method is not doing this conversion correctly, leading to the mismatch in the resulting Series index.

To fix this bug, the `_get_series_list` method needs to properly handle Index objects. When 'others' is an Index, it should be converted into a Series with the same values and the original index of the calling Series/Index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others.values, index=idx)]
    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)
```

This change ensures that when 'others' is an Index, it is properly converted into a Series with the correct values and index. The corrected method should resolve the issue with `str.cat` producing NaNs when 'others' is an Index.
