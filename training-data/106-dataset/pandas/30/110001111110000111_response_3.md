The error occurs when the `read_json` function is called with `typ="series"`, and the input JSON contains boolean values. This triggers the `_try_convert_to_date` method, which attempts to convert the input data to dates using the `to_datetime` function. Since boolean values cannot be converted to datetime, it throws a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` method should first check if the input data contains boolean values, and if so, return the original data without attempting to convert it to datetime. Additionally, the DataFrame/series parser in `read_json` should handle boolean values as well, as currently, it tries to infer the data type by default.

Below is the corrected `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

This modification ensures that if the input data contains boolean values, the method returns the original data and a boolean value of False, indicating that no conversion to datetime was performed.

Additionally, the DataFrame/series parser in `read_json` should be modified to handle boolean values appropriately.

These changes will fix the bug and ensure that boolean values are handled correctly when using the `typ="series"` option with `read_json`.
