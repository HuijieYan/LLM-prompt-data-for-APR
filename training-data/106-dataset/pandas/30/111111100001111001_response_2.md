Potential error location: It seems that the function is working with the assumption that `new_data` is a pandas Series object. However, in the buggy cases, `new_data` is a RangeIndex and Series object, which causes issues during the operation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function encounters errors with RangeIndex and Series objects because it assumes that the `new_data` variable is a pandas Series object and tries to perform operations specific to it. This creates issues and causes the function to behave incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the function differentiates between different types of input data and handles them accordingly. Specifically, if the input data is of type RangeIndex or Series, the function should handle the data differently than if it were a pandas Series object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, pd.RangeIndex):
            new_data = pd.Series(data._range)
        elif isinstance(data, pd.Series):
            new_data = data.copy()
        else:
            raise TypeError("Input should be either RangeIndex or Series")

        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == np.datetime64('NaT'))
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
