The error occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` function. The error message "key must be integer, timestamp or float" is raised, indicating that the tolerance type is not recognized as one of the supported types.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the tolerance type is not being handled properly in the `_get_merge_keys` function. The function is not checking the type of the tolerance parameter correctly and is raising an error when the tolerance type is not recognized as a supported type.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_merge_keys` function to properly handle the tolerance parameter. We should add proper type checking for the tolerance parameter and handle it based on the supported types (integer, timestamp, or float).

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # Check tolerance parameter type and handle it based on supported types
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if not isinstance(self.tolerance, (int, np.integer, pd.Timestamp, float)):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

By adding proper type checking for the tolerance parameter and handling it based on the supported types, we can ensure that the function does not raise an error when the tolerance type is not recognized as one of the supported types.
