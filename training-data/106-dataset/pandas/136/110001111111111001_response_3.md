The bug appears to be occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class, which is part of the merge module in pandas. The error message indicates that the tolerance must be an integer, timestamp, or float. This implies that the tolerance parameter is not being validated properly within the `_get_merge_keys` method.

The bug occurs because the validation for the tolerance parameter is not handling the integer type properly. The code is raising a `MergeError` when the tolerance is an integer, even though the error message suggests that tolerance can be an integer.

To fix this bug, the code should allow the tolerance to be an integer and handle it appropriately within the validation logic. Additionally, the conditional checks for different data types should be reviewed and updated as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if isinstance(self.tolerance, (int, float)):
            # tolerance is integer or float
            if self.tolerance < 0:
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        elif is_datetimelike(self.tolerance):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, (datetime.timedelta, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be a timedelta or Timedelta")
        else:
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # ... omitted code ...
```

With these changes, the `_get_merge_keys` method now correctly handles the tolerance parameter and validates it based on its type.

This should resolve the issue reported in the error message and ensure that the `pd.merge_asof` operation works correctly with integer tolerance values as well.
