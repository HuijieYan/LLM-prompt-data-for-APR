The bug in the provided function `_get_merge_keys` is likely due to the incorrect comparison of data types between the left and right join keys.

The code seems to be checking if the data types of the left and right keys are the same, and if not, it raises a `MergeError` with the message "key must be integer, timestamp or float". However, the data types being compared are part of the `numpy.dtype` object, and the comparison logic is not handling all possible data type cases correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the data types more flexibly, allowing for different numeric data types. Additionally, the error message and the raised error should be more specific to help identify the actual issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, _) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if lk.dtype.kind != rk.dtype.kind or lk.kind not in 'iu' or lk.kind != rk.kind:
            raise MergeError(f"Incompatible merge keys at index {i}. Keys must be of the same integer, unsigned integer, timestamp, or float type.")
                
    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code:
1. The data types of the left and right keys are compared based on their kinds and explicitly checked for being of the kind 'i' for signed integers and 'u' for unsigned integers which allows for a more flexible comparison.
2. The error message provides more specific information about the incompatible merge keys and the required types.
3. The corrected code uses f-strings for better readability and maintains the behavior of the original function with a more robust comparison.

This should address the issue and provide a more reliable behavior for the `_get_merge_keys` function.
