The error message indicates that the current implementation of the `_get_merge_keys` method in the `_AsOfMerge` class in the `merge.py` file is raising a `MergeError`. The error occurs when it tries to validate tolerance, index types, and merge keys.

The root cause of the bug may be related to the validation logic for tolerance, index types, and merge keys. It appears that the validation is not working as expected, leading to the incorrect raising of `MergeError`.

To fix the bug, the validation logic within the `_get_merge_keys` method should be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure it accurately checks for tolerance, index types, and merge keys as needed. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(self.left_index, self.right_index)):
        if lk != rk:
            raise MergeError(f"Incompatible index types at position {i}. Expected: {lk}, Actual: {rk}")

    # validate tolerance
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if type(self.tolerance) not in {datetime.timedelta, pd.Timedelta}:
            raise MergeError("Tolerance must be either a datetime.timedelta or a pandas.Timedelta")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, the validation for index types and tolerance has been modified to use comparisons for index types and a set of valid types for tolerance. Any discrepancies will now lead to an appropriate `MergeError` being raised, and the method will return the required merge keys.

This should address the bug in the `_get_merge_keys` function.
