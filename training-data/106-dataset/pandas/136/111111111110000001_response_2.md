The error messages indicate that there is a problem with the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class, which is a subclass of `_OrderedMerge`. The issue seems to relate to the validation of index types and tolerance for the merge operation, as indicated by the error message "key must be integer, timestamp or float."

The bug in the code may be due to the inconsistent handling of index types and tolerance checks.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method should be updated to ensure that the validation of index types and tolerance check follows the correct logic and properly handles the different data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    if self.validate_index_types(left_join_keys, right_join_keys):
        self.validate_tolerance(left_join_keys)

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In this proposed solution, the `_get_merge_keys` method calls two separate methods: `validate_index_types` and `validate_tolerance`. These methods handle the validation of index types and tolerance, respectively, according to the requirements of the merge operation.

By breaking down the logic into separate methods and ensuring that each method handles its specific task, the code becomes more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.
