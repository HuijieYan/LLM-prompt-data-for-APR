The potential error in the provided function is related to the variable 'i' in the line:
```
"incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and {rkdtype}, must be the same type"
```
As per the error message, the issue is with the formatting of the error message, which might not be using the correct value for the index variable 'i'.

Possible approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the correct value for 'i' is being used while formatting the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
