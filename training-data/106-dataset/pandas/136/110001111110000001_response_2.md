The error occurs when running the test case `test_int_type_tolerance` for the function `merge_asof` which calls the method `_get_merge_keys` from the file `merge.py`. The error message indicates that the key must be integer, timestamp, or float, suggesting that the data type of the key column is causing the issue.

From the error message, it can be inferred that there is a type mismatch in the key columns between the `left` and `right` DataFrames when calling the `pd.merge_asof` function. The error occurs because the key columns provided are not of the correct type.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method should check the data type of the key columns in the input DataFrames and ensure they are compatible for merging. This involves validating the data types and making any necessary type conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # Validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if lk.dtype.kind not in 'if' or rk.dtype.kind not in 'if':
                raise MergeError(f"Incompatible merge keys at index {i}, must be same type or integer, timestamp or float, found {lk.dtype} and {rk.dtype}")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

This fixes the bug by ensuring that the key columns are of compatible types for merging, and if not, it raises an appropriate error message.
