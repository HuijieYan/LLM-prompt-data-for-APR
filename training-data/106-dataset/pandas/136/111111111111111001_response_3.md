The error occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The incorrect error is raised when the tolerance value is not compatible with the type of the index.

The bug occurs because the code incorrectly checks the tolerance type only based on the type of index, not the join keys. This causes the method to raise an error when it should not.

To fix this bug, the code should check the tolerance type based on join keys instead of the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... (omitting other code) ...

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        tolerance_type = type(self.tolerance)
        join_key_types = [lk.dtype.type for lk in left_join_keys]

        if tolerance_type not in (datetime.timedelta, pd.Timedelta) and not all(
            issubclass(tolerance_type, key_type) for key_type in join_key_types
        ):
            raise MergeError("Tolerance must be compatible with the types of join keys")

    # ... (omitting other code) ...
```

In the corrected code, the tolerance type is checked against the types of the join keys. If the tolerance type is not a `datetime.timedelta` or `pd.Timedelta` and it's not compatible with the types of join keys, a `MergeError` is raised indicating that the tolerance must be compatible with the types of the join keys.
