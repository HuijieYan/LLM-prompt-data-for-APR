The error occurs because the `merge_asof()` function requires the key used for merging to be of int64 type, but this requirement is not mentioned in the error message or the documentation. The error message is confusing because it doesn't reflect the specific int type required.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the error message to clearly indicate that the key used for merging must be of int64 type. Additionally, the documentation should be updated to mention this requirement.

Here's the corrected code for the `merge_asof()` function:
```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            raise MergeError("incompatible merge keys, must be the same int64 type")

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if self.left_index:
            lt = self.left.index
        else:
            lt = left_join_keys[-1]
        
        if not is_integer_dtype(lt):
            raise MergeError("key must be of int64 type")

        # Additional checks for tolerance based on int64 type
        # ...

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the error message to clearly state the requirement for the key to be of int64 type. This change will provide users with a more informative error message when they attempt to use a different integer type for merging.
