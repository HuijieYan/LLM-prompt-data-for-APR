The potential error location within the problematic function is when it tries to access the parent class method `_get_merge_keys` using `super()._get_merge_keys()`. This line of code is trying to invoke the method from the parent class, but there seems to be no explicit parent class mentioned in the code provided.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the method `_get_merge_keys` from the parent class is not being called correctly, leading to potential conflicts or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the parent class is correctly referenced and the method `_get_merge_keys` is called from the parent class. Additionally, we need to ensure that the method signature and logic within the method are correct.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if lk.dtype != rk.dtype:
            raise MergeError(f"incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lk.dtype} and {rk.dtype}, must be the same type")

    # validate tolerance
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        lt = self.left.index if self.left_index else left_join_keys[-1]
        lt_dtype = lt.dtype

        if isinstance(self.tolerance, datetime.timedelta) and (is_datetimelike(lt) or is_int64_dtype(lt) or is_float_dtype(lt)):
            if self.tolerance < pd.Timedelta(0) and isinstance(self.tolerance, datetime.timedelta) and is_datetimelike(lt):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

            if self.tolerance < 0 and (is_int64_dtype(lt) or is_float_dtype(lt)):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        else:
            raise MergeError("incompatible tolerance, must be compatible with type {}".format(lt_dtype))

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not isinstance(self.allow_exact_matches, bool):
        raise MergeError("allow_exact_matches must be boolean")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
