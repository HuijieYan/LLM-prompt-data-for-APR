Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring at the code block that checks the type of the key used for the merge.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code incorrectly assumes that the merge key must be of type int64, which is not reflected in the error message or the documentation. This restrictive type check causes valid integer types to raise an error, even though they should be acceptable for merging.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the restrictive type check and allow integer types other than int64 to be accepted for merging.
2. Update the error message to reflect the acceptable integer types for the merge key.
3. Update the documentation to specify the acceptable integer types for the merge key.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas.errors import MergeError
from pandas.api.types import is_integer

def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def _get_merge_keys(self):
    
        # note this function has side effects
        (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()
    
        # validate index types are the same
        for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
            if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
                if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                    # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                    #
                    # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                    # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                    # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                    # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                    # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                    # for them here.
                    msg = (
                        "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                        "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                            i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                        )
                    )
                else:
                    msg = (
                        "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                        "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                            i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                        )
                    )
                raise MergeError(msg)
    
        # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
        if self.tolerance is not None:
            if self.left_index:
                lt = self.left.index
            else:
                lt = left_join_keys[-1]
    
            if not is_integer(lt):
                msg = (
                    "key must be integer, timestamp or float"
                )
                raise MergeError(msg)
    
        # validate allow_exact_matches
        if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
            msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
            raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))
    
        return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
In the corrected code, the type check for the merge key has been updated to allow integer types other than int64. The error messages for type validation have also been updated to provide more specific information to the user.
