The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof` function is called within the test case. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the data types being used in the merge operation and the tolerance. It points to the `_get_merge_keys` method within the `_AsOfMerge` class as the location of the bug.

The bug occurs because the method `_get_merge_keys` in the `_AsOfMerge` class is not correctly validating the types of the join keys and the tolerance. This results in the MergeError being raised when invoking `pd.merge_asof`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method should be updated to correctly validate the types of the join keys and the tolerance. This involves ensuring that the data types of the join keys and the tolerance are compatible before proceeding with the merge operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if lk.dtype != rk.dtype:
            raise MergeError(f"Incompatible merge keys at index {i}. Both types must be the same.")

    # validate tolerance
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if is_datetimelike(left_join_keys[-1]):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, (datetime.timedelta, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be a datetime.timedelta or pd.Timedelta for datetime-like types.")
            if self.tolerance < pd.Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be positive.")
        elif is_numeric_dtype(left_join_keys[-1]):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, (int, float)):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be integer or float for numeric types.")
            if self.tolerance < 0:
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be positive.")
        else:
            raise MergeError("Key must be integer, timestamp, or float.")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code:
1. The data types of the merge keys are validated, and MergeError is raised if they are not the same.
2. The tolerance is validated based on the data type of the keys. If the tolerance is provided and it does not match the expected data type, MergeError is raised.

This should address the bug and allow the `pd.merge_asof` function to work correctly.
