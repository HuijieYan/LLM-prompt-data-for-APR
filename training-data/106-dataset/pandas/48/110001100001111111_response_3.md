The bug is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This error also occurs with other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

The issue is likely related to the `Int64` data type, which may not be properly handled by the function. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely where the issue is occurring.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the `Int64` data type properly. This may involve adding specific handling for the `Int64` type in the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Add specific handling for the Int64 data type
    if data.get_dtype() == "Int64":
        data = data.astype('float64')

    # ... existing code ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the data type is `Int64`, and if so, we convert it to `float64` to ensure compatibility with the aggregation functions. This should handle the aggregation of `Int64` data type properly and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
