The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the manipulation and aggregation of data blocks, particularly in cases where split blocks are present.

The bug may be occurring due to the mishandling of split blocks, leading to incorrect aggregation or data manipulation.

To fix the bug, it's important to properly handle split blocks by ensuring that the indexing and manipulation of split blocks is correctly managed. Additionally, any calculations or adjustments that rely on the presence of split blocks should be carefully reviewed and updated if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get the data to be aggregated
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Filter data to include only numeric columns if required
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Initialize lists to store aggregated blocks and other relevant data
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Iterate through each block and perform the aggregation
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)

        # Handle the result of the aggregation
        self._handle_aggregation_result(result, block, agg_blocks, new_items, deleted_items)

    # Check if any aggregated blocks or split frames are present
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handle split blocks if present
    if split_items:
        self._handle_split_blocks(split_items, split_frames, new_items, agg_blocks)

    # Reorder the aggregated items according to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for any removed items
    if deleted_items:
        indexer = self._adjust_indexer(indexer, deleted_items, len(data))

    # Update the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = self._update_block_locs(agg_blocks, indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
