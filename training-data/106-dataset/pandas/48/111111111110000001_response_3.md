The error occurs when attempting to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, resulting in a TypeError. This happens because the values being cast are non-equivalent, meaning floats are not equivalent to integers.

The issue here is that the code is trying to cast float64 values to int64, resulting in a loss of precision. This is evident in the error message, where it states that "cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64."

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the appropriate data type is used for the values being cast. In this case, since the output should be a float, the code should ensure that the output array is of dtype float.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... (other omitted code)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
