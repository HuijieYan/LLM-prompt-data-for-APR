The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the loop over `data.blocks` and the aggregation of the block values. The use of `no_result` and the conditional logic surrounding it may be causing unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to aggregate the block values using different aggregation functions and handling exceptions for certain cases. However, the use of `no_result` and the conditional branching based on it may not be correctly handling all cases, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the conditional branching and exception handling code can be simplified and refactored to ensure that all cases are handled correctly. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have clearer error messages if certain conditions are not met.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None and how == "ohlc":
                # raise an error if the condition is not met
                raise NotImplementedError("Operation not applicable")
            elif alt is not None:
                # handle the aggregation using an alternate method
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
