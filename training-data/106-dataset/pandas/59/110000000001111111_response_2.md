The buggy function `corr()` seems to be experiencing a memory error due to the large array shape being created when calling the `rolling().corr()` method with a large dataset. The issue seems to be related to the `_get_window()` method which is supposed to return the window size in nanoseconds based on the provided frequency (`self.win_freq`) and the `rolling` object.

To fix the bug and address the memory error, the `_get_window()` method needs to be updated to correctly calculate the window size in nanoseconds, which will then be used in the `_get_corr` function to limit the size of the rolling windows.

Here's the corrected version of the function.

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    # only default unset
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window_ns = pd.to_timedelta(self.win_freq).value
    window = self._get_window(other, window_ns)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `_get_window()` method is called with the `window_ns` parameter which represents the window size in nanoseconds. This should prevent the creation of excessively large arrays and address the memory error.
