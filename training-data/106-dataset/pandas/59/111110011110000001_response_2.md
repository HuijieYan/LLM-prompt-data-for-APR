The error message indicates a `MemoryError` occurred when trying to allocate memory for an array with a shape of (43200000000000,).

The issue seems to be with the `_get_corr` function inside the `corr` method of the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. It attempts to calculate `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))` for every pair of values in the rolling windows of `a` and `b`, which might result in excessive memory allocation for large rolling windows.

The bug occurs due to the potentially large size of the rolling windows when the `12H` frequency is used in the test case. This leads to excessive memory usage and a `MemoryError`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to refactor the calculation performed by the `_get_corr` function to avoid the excessive memory allocation. Instead of calculating the covariance and standard deviation for each pair of values in the rolling windows, it can be calculated for the entire rolling windows at once, which should reduce memory usage. Additionally, consideration should be given to avoiding unnecessary memory-intensive operations, such as creating large intermediary arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    a = self._selected_obj.rolling(
        window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
    )
    b = other._selected_obj.rolling(
        window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
    )
    
    cov_values = a.cov(b, **kwargs)
    std_product = a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs)
    result = cov_values / std_product

    return _flex_binary_result(self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, result, pairwise=bool(pairwise))
```
