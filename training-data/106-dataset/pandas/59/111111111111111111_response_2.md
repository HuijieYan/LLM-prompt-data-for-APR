The error in the code occurs within the `corr` method of the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. The reason for the MemoryError is that the code is trying to allocate too much memory for the calculation due to the large `window` size.

To fix this issue, it is important to correctly calculate the window value and use it in the method `_get_corr` which is used in the `corr` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = pd.Timedelta(self.window)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

The important changes are:
1. Using `pd.Timedelta(self.window)` to correctly calculate the window value.
2. Passing this calculated `window` to the `rolling` method in the `_get_corr` function.

This should resolve the MemoryError issue and provide the correct calculations as expected.
