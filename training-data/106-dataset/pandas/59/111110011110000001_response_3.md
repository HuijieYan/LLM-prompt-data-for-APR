The error message indicates a MemoryError, specifically "Unable to allocate 314 TiB for an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64". This error occurs when attempting to allocate an excessively large array, likely due to an infinite loop or incorrect indexing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the window size. The window size may be calculated in a way that leads to an excessively large array allocation.

The bug occurs because the window size calculation in the _get_corr() function may not be constrained properly, leading to an overly large memory allocation for the array.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to properly constrain the window size so that it does not lead to an excessively large memory allocation. This could be done by revising the logic for calculating the window size based on the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = min(len(self._selected_obj), len(other._selected_obj))  # Limit window size to the length of the data

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the window size is calculated as the minimum length between the 'self' data and the 'other' data, ensuring that the window size is constrained and does not lead to excessive memory allocation.
