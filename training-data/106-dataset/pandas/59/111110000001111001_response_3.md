The bug is in the `_get_corr` function inside the `corr` method. This is because the `_get_corr` function is not properly defined within the `corr` method, resulting in a NameError when it is called. The `_get_corr` function should be defined outside the `corr` method to make it accessible.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise), **kwargs
    )

def _get_corr(self, a, b):
    a = a.rolling(
        window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
    )
    b = b.rolling(
        window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
    )

    return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
```

In the corrected code:
- The `_get_corr` function is defined outside the `corr` method as a separate method of the class.
- The `self` parameter is added to the `_get_corr` method to indicate that it's a method of the class.
- The `**kwargs` parameter is passed to the `_get_corr` method to ensure that the `kwargs` variable is accessible within the `_get_corr` method.
- The `window` property is accessed using `self.window` to ensure that the correct attribute is being used.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the `corr` method should work as expected.
