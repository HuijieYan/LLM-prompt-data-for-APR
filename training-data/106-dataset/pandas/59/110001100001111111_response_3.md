The issue is likely because the window size is too large, and it's causing a `MemoryError`. This is likely due to the `corr` function calling `cov` and `std` with a very large window size.

To fix the issue, the window size should be changed to a smaller value.

Here's the corrected function with the smaller window size:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    window = 100

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the above code, I've changed the `window` variable to 100 to provide a smaller window size, which should address the memory error issue.
