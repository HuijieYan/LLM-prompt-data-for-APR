The test case 'test_corr_freq_memory_error' creates a Series 's' using the date_range function with periods=5. It then applies the rolling window operation with a window size of "12H" and attempts to find the correlation using the corr method. The expected output is a Series of NaN values.

The error occurs during the execution of the corr function. It seems that the usage of excessively large window size (e.g., "12H") is leading to a MemoryError due to the large amount of memory allocation.

The bug occurs because of the incorrect handling of the window size parameter. The value passed to the corr function is "12H", but it needs to be converted to an appropriate integer value representing the window size in nanoseconds.

To fix the bug, the function _get_corr should be updated to convert the window size to nanoseconds. Then, the corr function itself should handle the conversion of window size appropriately. The _get_corr function also needs to handle the pairwise argument correctly and pass it to the cov method.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    window_ns = self.win_freq.nanos
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, pairwise=pairwise, ddof=1, min_periods=self.min_periods) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the window size is obtained using self._get_window and converted to nanoseconds using self.win_freq.nanos. This corrected function should avoid the memory error encountered in the test case.
