The bug appears to be in the implementation of the `_get_corr` function within the `corr` method. The `_get_corr` function is being defined within the `corr` method, instead of being a standalone function, and this might be causing unexpected behavior.

It seems that there is a memory error occurring when using the `rolling().corr()` method with a `Series` and a correlation window greater than 1.0.

To fix the bug, the `_get_corr` function should be defined outside of the `corr` method, and it should take `a` and `b` as input parameters. Additionally, the `window` should be calculated as an integer value, not a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _get_corr function
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        return a.cov(b) / (a.std() * b.std())

    # corrected corr method
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = int(self._get_window(other))

        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
```

By defining the `_get_corr` function outside of the `corr` method and ensuring that the `window` is calculated as an integer, this should resolve the memory error issue and provide the correct calculations for the correlation.
