Potential error location: The problem seems to be arising from the use of the `rolling` method in the `_get_corr` function of the provided code. When a large dataset is used, it leads to a MemoryError.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the rolling window calculations for large datasets are consuming excessive memory, leading to a MemoryError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a smaller dataset for testing, or increase the computational resources if the dataset is too large.
2. Optimize the rolling window calculations to reduce memory consumption.
3. Use a different approach for calculating the correlation that doesn't require excessive memory.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        return a.corr(b)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function simply calculates the correlation between the two series using the `corr` method, which is more memory-efficient than using the `rolling` method for large datasets. This should help avoid the MemoryError issue.
