The bug seems to be related to memory allocation when using the `rolling().corr()` method with large datasets. The error message indicates that there is an issue with allocating memory for a large array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of `window` and its usage in the `_get_corr` function.

The bug occurs because the window size is being defined as a string (`'12H'`) and is not converted to the appropriate data type for memory allocation. Additionally, the use of this window size in the `_get_corr` function might be causing memory allocation issues.

To fix the bug, the window size should be converted to an appropriate data type for memory allocation. Additionally, the implementation of the `_get_corr` function might need to be optimized to handle large datasets more efficiently.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    window = window.total_seconds() * 1e9  # convert window to nanoseconds

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=int(window), min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=int(window), min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
