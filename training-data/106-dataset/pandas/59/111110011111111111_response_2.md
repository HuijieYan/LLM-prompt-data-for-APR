The test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error` is related to the error message, which indicates a MemoryError when trying to allocate a large array of shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64. This indicates that there is a memory allocation issue within the `corr` function, specifically when using the `rolling` method with a large window size.

The potential error location is within the `_get_corr` function, where the calculation for covariance and standard deviation is causing the memory allocation error due to the size of the array being created.

The bug is occurring because the size of the array being created for the window of the rolling operation is too large, leading to a memory allocation error. This can happen when the size of the window is larger than the available memory.

To fix the bug, we can modify the window size to a more manageable value or optimize the computation within the `_get_corr` function to avoid creating excessively large arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, pairwise=pairwise, ddof=1) / (a.std(ddof=1) * b.std(ddof=1))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we've added the `ddof` parameter with a default value of 1 to the `cov` and `std` functions to ensure that the degrees of freedom are set appropriately for the calculation. We've also removed the `**kwargs` from these function calls to provide more clarity in the code. This should help to optimize the memory usage and avoid the MemoryError.
