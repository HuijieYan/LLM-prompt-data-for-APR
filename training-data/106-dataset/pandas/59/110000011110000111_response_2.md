The error message indicates a MemoryError when trying to allocate a very large array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64. This suggests that the bug is related to memory allocation or usage within the "corr" function, specifically within the "_get_corr" helper function.

The reason for the bug could be due to the large size of the rolling window and the subsequent calculation of covariance and standard deviation within the "_get_corr" function.

To fix this bug, we can consider reducing the size of the rolling window or optimizing the calculations for covariance and standard deviation to reduce memory usage.

Here's the corrected code for the "corr" function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    if pairwise is None:
        pairwise = True
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        return a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs) / (a_rolling.std(**kwargs) * b_rolling.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the default assignment of "pairwise" to True within the function signature, and we have explicitly checked if pairwise is None before making any assignments. Additionally, we have modified the "_get_corr" function to calculate rolling covariance and standard deviation directly from the rolling objects instead of modifying them in place.

This should fix the MemoryError when large rolling windows are used in the "corr" function.
