The test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error` is calling the `rolling("12H").corr()` function. This function calculates the correlation between the series, but there is a memory error due to the allocation of a large array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the correlation between the series using the `_get_corr` function.

The memory error occurs because the window size used in the corr function is too large, leading to the creation of a large array that causes a memory error. This happens when the window size is set to `'12H'`, which is converted to `43200000000000`.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the window size does not exceed the memory constraints.

Here's the corrected function, taking into account the constraint of the window size:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        rolling_window = min(window, len(a))  # Limit window size to the length of the series
        a = a.rolling(
            window=rolling_window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=rolling_window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
