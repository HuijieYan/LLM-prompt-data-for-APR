Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the _get_corr() function within the corr() method of the _Rolling_and_Expanding class. The _get_corr() function is used to calculate the correlation between two rolling windows, but it is defined as a nested function within the corr() method, which is unnecessary and could lead to confusion.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The _get_corr() function is defined within the corr() method, which is not needed and could lead to confusion. Additionally, the _get_corr() function is redefined within the same class, which is redundant and error-prone.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary definition of the _get_corr() function within the corr() method.
2. Define the _get_corr() function outside the corr() method to avoid redundancy and improve code clarity.

Corrected Code:
```python
class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... other methods ...

    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)
        
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
    
    def _get_corr(self, a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
