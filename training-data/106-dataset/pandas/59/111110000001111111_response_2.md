The bug occurs due to a MemoryError when calculating the correlation of two Series using the rolling window. This happens because the window size is too large, causing excessive memory allocation.

To fix this issue, the window size for rolling correlation calculation needs to be reduced. This can be achieved by modifying the window size parameter passed to the rolling function.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = pd.to_timedelta(self.win_freq)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

By using `pd.to_timedelta(self.win_freq)`, we extract the window size in seconds and use it for the rolling window calculation. This should resolve the MemoryError issue that occurs with large window sizes.
