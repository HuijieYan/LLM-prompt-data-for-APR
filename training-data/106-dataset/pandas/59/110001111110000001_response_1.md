The test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error` creates a Series `s` with 5 values, indexed by 12-hour intervals for a total of 5 periods. It then calculates the rolling correlation of the series with itself using a window of "12H".

The error message indicates a MemoryError, specifically stating that it's unable to allocate a huge amount of memory for an array with shape (43200000000000,). This suggests that the rolling correlation operation is attempting to use an excessively large array which leads to a memory allocation error.

The potential error location within the `corr` function is likely in the calculation of windowed covariance and standard deviations in the `_get_corr` function. Since the Series `s` has only 5 values, the window size of "12H" might be leading to a very large window size due to the frequency of the index, resulting in a MemoryError.

To fix this bug, we can limit the window size to a more reasonable value, such as the number of periods in the Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
    
        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
    if window > len(self._selected_obj):  # Limiting the window size to the length of the Series
        window = len(self._selected_obj)
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
