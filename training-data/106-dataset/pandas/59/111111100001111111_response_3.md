The potential error in the given function is the memory allocation issue when using `rolling().corr()` with large data. The bug is occurring because the window size is too big, causing excessive memory allocation.

To fix this bug, the window size needs to be appropriately adjusted to prevent excessive memory allocation and to ensure the correct calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    
    # Use approximate rolling window size to prevent excessive memory allocation
    window = self._get_window(other, win_type='freq')
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

By using an approximate rolling window size, we prevent the excessive memory allocation issue when dealing with large data, solving the bug related to memory error.
