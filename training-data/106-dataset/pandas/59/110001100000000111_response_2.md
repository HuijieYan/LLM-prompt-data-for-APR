Analysis:
The error message "MemoryError when using series.rolling().corr(other) with >1.0" indicates that there might be a memory allocation issue when using the corr() method with large series.

Potential Error Location:
The issue might be within the _get_corr() function, where the rolling window is used to perform calculations on the series. There might be an inefficient memory allocation or calculation method causing the MemoryError.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug could be due to inefficient memory handling within the _get_corr() function, leading to MemoryError when dealing with large series.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use more memory-efficient methods for calculating the correlation of rolling windows.
2. Optimize the memory allocation and calculation process within the _get_corr() function to prevent the MemoryError.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_59/pandas/core/window/rolling.py

# corrected function
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other, win_type='rolling')

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        a_cov_b = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        a_std = a_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
        b_std = b_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)

        return a_cov_b / (a_std * b_std)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the _get_corr() function now uses the rolling windows for calculating covariance and standard deviation separately, and then performs the correlation calculation. This approach should be more memory-efficient and prevent the MemoryError issue.
