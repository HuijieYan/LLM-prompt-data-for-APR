The bug in the provided function `corr` seems to be related to the memory allocation error when calculating the correlation between two rolling series. The error message indicates an attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, which is not feasible.

The potential error location within the `corr` function is the calculation of the rolling window correlation using the `_get_corr` function. It seems that the use of rolling windows for large series is leading to excessive memory allocation, resulting in the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the rolling window size is too large, causing memory allocation issues. This could be due to the total number of data points in the series being used, or the window size being too large for the available memory.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the calculation of the rolling window correlation to handle large series without excessive memory allocation. This could involve breaking down the correlation calculation into smaller chunks, or using an approach that does not require the entire window to be stored in memory.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)

    # Perform rolling correlation calculation in smaller chunks to avoid excessive memory allocation
    result = []
    chunk_size = 1000  # Define a chunk size
    for i in range(0, len(self), chunk_size):
        chunk_a = self[i:i+chunk_size].rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        chunk_b = other[i:i+chunk_size].rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        chunk_corr = chunk_a.cov(chunk_b, **kwargs) / (chunk_a.std(**kwargs) * chunk_b.std(**kwargs))
        result.extend(chunk_corr)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the rolling correlation calculation is performed in smaller chunks (defined by `chunk_size`) to avoid excessive memory allocation. This should help prevent the memory error when calculating the correlation for large series.
