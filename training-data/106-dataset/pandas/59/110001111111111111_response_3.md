The bug seems to be related to memory allocation when using the `rolling().corr()` method with certain inputs, specifically when `pairwise=True` in the `_get_corr` function.

The error message clearly states a memory allocation error due to the shape of an array being too large. This suggests that the calculation within the `_get_corr` function is resulting in an excessively large array being generated, leading to the memory error.

To fix this issue, one potential approach is to rewrite the `_get_corr` function and the `corr` method to handle the pairwise calculation in a more memory-efficient way. Specifically, the calculation of `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))` needs to be revisited to avoid excessively large arrays.

The corrected code for the `corr` method is as follows:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_data = a._data
        b_data = b._data
        cov = a_data.cov(b_data, **kwargs)
        std_a = a_data.std(**kwargs)
        std_b = b_data.std(**kwargs)
        return cov / (std_a * std_b)
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function directly accesses the data of `a` and `b` (using `a._data` and `b._data`), and then calculates the covariance and standard deviations, avoiding any unnecessary memory allocation and significantly reducing the risk of a memory error.

This correction should handle the memory error while still providing the correct calculation for the `rolling().corr()` method.
