This code is attempting to calculate the rolling correlation between two Series. However, there are multiple type-related inconsistencies in the code provided.

The error message indicates a MemoryError when trying to allocate an array with a massive shape. This is likely due to an infinite loop or a large value being passed to shape in the code.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_corr` should be updated and corrected. The source of the bug is likely the calculation inside `_get_corr`, specifically the kernel involving `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(x, y):
        rolling_corr = x.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center).corr(y)
        return rolling_corr

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function is defining the rolling correlation directly using the `rolling` method of the Series object. This eliminates the need to calculate covariance and standard deviation manually, and it should resolve the MemoryError issue.
