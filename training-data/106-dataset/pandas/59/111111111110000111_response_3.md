Potential error location: The error is occurring within the `corr` method of the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error message suggests a MemoryError due to the inability to allocate memory for a large array. This indicates that the calculation within the `corr` method is resulting in an excessively large array creation, leading to a memory allocation issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One potential approach to fix the bug is to optimize the calculation within the `_get_corr` function to avoid excessive memory allocation. This may involve modifying the method of calculation or applying optimization techniques to reduce memory usage.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_rolling = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        # Calculate the rolling covariance and standard deviations
        cov_result = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        std_result = a_rolling.std(**kwargs) * b_rolling.std(**kwargs)
        # Perform the division of cov_result by std_result
        return cov_result / std_result

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function has been modified to separately calculate the rolling covariance and standard deviations for the given rolling windows. Then, the results are divided to achieve the correlation calculation. This approach may reduce excessive memory allocations and resolve the MemoryError issue.
