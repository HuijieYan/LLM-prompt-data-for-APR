The error is likely occurring within the `_get_corr` function, specifically at the line `return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))`. This is because large calculations are being performed with rolling windows, causing memory errors.

The bug occurs because the rolling window is too large, causing memory errors when performing calculations. The large window size leads to excessive memory allocation, resulting in a MemoryError.

To fix this issue, we can reduce the window size or handle the computation differently to prevent excessive memory allocation. This can involve optimizing the calculation or breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps to avoid memory errors.

Here's the corrected function with a reduced window size:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = min(self._get_window(other), 100)  # Limit window size

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
