The error MemoryError is likely due to memory issues with the `rolling().corr()` method. The method calculates the rolling correlation between two Series over a specified window, and the issue appears to be related to memory allocation when using large datasets.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the rolling correlation using the `_get_corr` function. This function uses the `a.cov(b, **kwargs)` method, which calculates the covariance between Series 'a' and 'b', and then divides it by the product of the standard deviations of 'a' and 'b'. The size of the data and the window for the rolling calculation can lead to memory allocation issues, which is causing the MemoryError in this case.

To fix the bug and avoid memory allocation issues, you can modify the `_get_corr` function to perform the rolling correlation calculation in smaller chunks over the specified window. This approach can help prevent excessive memory usage when dealing with large datasets.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        # calculate rolling correlation in chunks
        rolling_correlation = []
        start_idx = 0
        end_idx = min(window, len(a))
        while end_idx <= len(a):
            a_chunk = a.iloc[start_idx:end_idx]
            b_chunk = b.iloc[start_idx:end_idx]
            rolling_correlation.append(a_chunk.corr(b_chunk, **kwargs))
            start_idx += 1
            end_idx += 1
        
        return pd.concat(rolling_correlation)
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now calculates the rolling correlation in smaller chunks by iterating over the data in the specified window. This approach helps prevent excessive memory usage and avoids the MemoryError issue when dealing with larger datasets.
