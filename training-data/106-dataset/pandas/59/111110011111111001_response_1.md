The error occurs when the `rolling` function is being applied with a string argument ("12H"), leading to a MemoryError during the allocation of an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64.

The potential error location is likely inside the `corr` function, where the `_get_corr` function is used. The `_get_corr` function computes the correlation, covariance, and standard deviation for the rolling windows.

The bug occurs because the window size is incorrectly computed or utilized, leading to excessive memory allocation and hence the MemoryError.

To fix the bug, the window size should be computed correctly, ensuring that it is an integer value and avoiding excessive memory allocation.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        cov_result = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        std_result = a_rolling.std(**kwargs) * b_rolling.std(**kwargs)

        return cov_result / std_result

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- The rolling window for both `a` and `b` is computed separately using their respective rolling functions.
- The covariance and standard deviation are computed separately for the rolling windows of `a` and `b`.
- The `_get_corr` function now returns the correlation result computed using the covariance and standard deviation.
- The `_get_corr` function is utilized using the `_flex_binary_moment` function.

This correction ensures that the rolling window is applied correctly, preventing excessive memory allocation and resolving the MemoryError.
