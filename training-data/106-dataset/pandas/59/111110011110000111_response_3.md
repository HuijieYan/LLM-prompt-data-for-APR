The error message indicates a MemoryError when trying to allocate a large amount of memory for an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64. 

The potential error location within the code can be the _get_corr() function, specifically when it attempts to calculate the correlation using rolling window operations. The multiplication operation required for calculating the correlation using rolling windows might be causing the excessive memory allocation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the inefficient memory handling when performing the rolling window correlation calculations.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to optimize the memory usage by implementing chunking or batching when performing rolling window operations. This can help reduce the overall memory footprint while still achieving the desired calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        
        # Calculate the rolling mean before performing the rolling correlation
        a_mean = a_rolling.mean()
        b_mean = b_rolling.mean()

        # Calculate the rolling covariance and rolling standard deviation
        rolling_cov = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        rolling_std_product = a_rolling.std(**kwargs) * b_rolling.std(**kwargs)
        
        return rolling_cov / rolling_std_product

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
