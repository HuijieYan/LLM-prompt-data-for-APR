The issue seems to be with the `is_string_dtype` function, which incorrectly identifies categorical data as string dtype. This bug is evident from the failing test case `test_not_string` where it is expected that `is_string_dtype` returns False for a CategoricalDtype, but it returns True instead.

The issue lies within the `condition` function in the `is_string_dtype` method. The condition function checks for dtype.kind, and if it's one of ("O", "S", "U"), it returns True. The problem is that the categorical data also has the kind "O", but it should not be classified as a string dtype.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `condition` function to correctly identify the categorical data as non-string dtype.

Corrected function:

```python
def is_string_dtype(arr_or_dtype) -> bool:
    def condition(dtype) -> bool:
        return (dtype.kind in ["O", "S", "U"]) and (not pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(dtype))

    return _is_dtype(arr_or_dtype, condition)
```

In this corrected function, we have added a check using `pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype` to exclude the categorical dtype from being classified as a string dtype.

With this fix, the function should now correctly identify the string dtype and exclude the categorical data from being classified as a string dtype. This should address the failing test case and the identified bug.
