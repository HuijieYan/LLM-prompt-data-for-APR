The issue is with the `is_string_dtype` function incorrectly identifying categorical data as string data. The implementation of the function is not taking into account the case of categorical dtype, which is causing the problem.

The potential error location within the function is the `condition` function, which is used to check whether the provided dtype is of the string dtype. This function needs to be modified to also account for categorical dtype.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_string_dtype` function is not excluding the categorical dtype, which has kind = "O" but isn't a string dtype.

One approach to fixing the bug is to update the `condition` function to check for categorical dtype as well and exclude it if it is not supposed to be considered as a string dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_string_dtype` function:

```python
def is_string_dtype(arr_or_dtype) -> bool:
    def condition(dtype) -> bool:
        return dtype.kind in ("O", "S", "U") and not (is_excluded_dtype(dtype) or is_categorical_dtype(dtype))

    def is_excluded_dtype(dtype) -> bool:
        """
        These have kind = "O" but aren't string dtypes so need to be explicitly excluded
        """
        is_excluded_checks = (is_period_dtype, is_interval_dtype)
        return any(is_excluded(dtype) for is_excluded in is_excluded_checks)

    def is_categorical_dtype(dtype) -> bool:
        return isinstance(dtype, CategoricalDtype)

    return _is_dtype(arr_or_dtype, condition)
```

With this correction, the `is_string_dtype` function should now correctly identify categorical data and not incorrectly evaluate it as a string dtype.
