Potential error location: 
The error seems to be related to the 'TimedeltaIndex' and 'TimedeltaArray' classes and the 'freq' parameter not matching the inferred frequency from the passed values. 

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the frequency provided in the 'freq' parameter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the code to ensure that the 'freq' parameter is correctly used and that it matches the inferred frequency from the passed values.
2. Verify the implementation of the 'TimedeltaIndex' and 'TimedeltaArray' classes and their interaction with the 'freq' parameter.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    inferred_freq = getattr(data, "freq", None) if hasattr(data, "freq") else None
    if (
        isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray)
        or isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex)
        and inferred_freq is not None
        and freq != inferred_freq
    ):
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
