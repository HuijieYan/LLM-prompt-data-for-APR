The test case `test_infer_from_tdi_mismatch` is designed to check whether the `TimedeltaIndex` class raises a `ValueError` with a specific message when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The issue lies in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The bug occurs because when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex` instance using `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")`, the function does not raise a `ValueError` as expected, indicating that the frequency check is not working correctly.

The bug occurs because the frequency comparison logic does not correctly handle cases where the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the frequency comparison logic in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class needs to be updated to correctly compare the inferred frequency with the passed frequency and raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message if they do not conform.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, unit=None, freq=None, closed=None, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False, name=None
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    inferred_freq = getattr(data, "inferred_freq", None)
    freq_mismatch = inferred_freq is not None and freq is not None and inferred_freq != freq
    if freq_mismatch:
        raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}")

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for frequency mismatch using the `inferred_freq` attribute and raising a `ValueError` with the appropriate message if the frequencies do not conform. This should fix the bug and make the `__new__` method work as intended.
