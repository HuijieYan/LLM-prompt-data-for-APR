The error message from the test function is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when `tdi._data` is passed with `freq="D"`.

The potential error location within the `__new__` function is in the handling of the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor and the frequency mismatch.

The bug occurred because the `__new__` function is not correctly handling the case when a `TimedeltaIndex` is passed with `freq` and the data is accessed using `tdi._data`. This should result in a `ValueError` if the inferred frequency from the data does not match the passed frequency, but this is not happening.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a `TimedeltaIndex` is passed with a frequency mismatch. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `data` is a `TimedeltaIndex` and if `freq` is not None and `name` is None, and then raise a `ValueError` if the inferred frequency from the data does not match the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and name is None:
        inferred_freq = data.inferred_freq
        if inferred_freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency '{inferred_freq}' from passed values does not conform to passed frequency '{freq}'"
            )
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
