The error message indicates that the function TimedeltaIndex is not raising a ValueError as expected when called with input parameters tdi._data and freq='D'. This suggests that the conditional block within the __new__ method of the TimedeltaIndex class is not functioning as intended.

The potential error location is within the conditional block that processes instances of TimedeltaIndex.

The bug occurs because the conditional block that checks if the input data is an instance of TimedeltaIndex does not return data as expected. This leads to the ValueError not being raised when the frequency constraint is violated.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional block to properly check if the input data is an instance of TimedeltaIndex and appropriately return the result. Additionally, the error message needs to be raised when the frequency constraint is violated.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method:

```python
# Corrected __new__ method
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex):
        if freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
        else:
            if data.freq != freq:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Inferred frequency {data.freq} from passed values does "
                    "not conform to passed frequency"
                )
            else:
                if copy:
                    return data.copy()
                else:
                    return data._shallow_copy()

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
