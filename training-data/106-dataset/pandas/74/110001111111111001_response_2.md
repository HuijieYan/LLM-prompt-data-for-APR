The error message in the test function suggests that when trying to create a TimedeltaIndex with a specified frequency ("D" for days), this frequency does not match the inferred frequency from the passed values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None`. This condition checks if the 'data' parameter is an instance of TimedeltaIndex and if the 'freq' and 'name' parameters are None. If all these conditions are true, the function should return a shallow copy of the data, otherwise it should create a new TimedeltaArray from the data and call `_simple_new` with the appropriate parameters.

The bug occurs because this condition is not handling the case where 'freq' is not None and 'name' is not None (as long as 'data' is an instance of TimedeltaIndex). In this situation, the function should create a new TimedeltaArray from the data and call `_simple_new` with the appropriate parameters.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition to handle the case where 'freq' is not None and 'name' is not None. If this condition is not met, then the function should follow the existing logic for creating a new TimedeltaArray from the data and calling `_simple_new`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # New condition to handle 'freq' and 'name' not being None
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and name is not None:
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
