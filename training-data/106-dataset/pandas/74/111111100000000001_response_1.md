Explanation:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_simple_new` function and the `__new__` function. The error occurs because the `_simple_new` function is called within the `__new__` function, but it is not defined properly within the class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_simple_new` function is not defined within the `TimedeltaIndex` class, so when it is called within the `__new__` function, it causes an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_simple_new` function needs to be properly defined within the `TimedeltaIndex` class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _simple_new(cls, values, name=None, freq=None, dtype=_TD_DTYPE):
    # Properly define the function here
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(cls, data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(cls, tdarr, name=name)
```
