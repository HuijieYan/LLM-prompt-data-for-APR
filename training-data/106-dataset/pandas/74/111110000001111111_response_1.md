The error seems to occur in the input validation process as the function expects certain input types for `data` and `cls`.

The potential error location within the function is at the beginning where it checks if `data` is a scalar and raises a `TypeError` if true. 

The reason for the bug is that it does not properly handle cases where `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray`, and in certain cases, it throws an error even when the input is valid.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the check for scalar data, as it causes unnecessary errors. Instead, focus on handling the input based on its type, ensuring that the correct actions are taken for each case.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

The corrected code removes the unnecessary check for scalar data and ensures that the input is properly handled based on its type. It also properly passes the frequency value to the `_simple_new` method when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex`.
