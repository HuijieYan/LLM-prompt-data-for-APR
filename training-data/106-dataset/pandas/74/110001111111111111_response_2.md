The issue appears to be related to the incorrect handling of the `freq` parameter in the `__new__` method of the TimedeltaIndex class. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location is the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
    if copy:
        data = data.copy()
    return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
```

The bug occurs because the `freq` parameter is not being correctly handled when creating a new instance of a TimedeltaIndex. This results in the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency, as indicated by the error message.

To fix this bug, the handling of the `freq` parameter needs to be revised to ensure that it is properly passed and used when creating a new instance of the TimedeltaIndex. Additionally, the logic for checking and processing the `unit` parameter should be reviewed as it may lead to unexpected behavior when a frequency is specified.

The corrected code for the `__new__` method of the TimedeltaIndex class is as follows:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
``` 

In the corrected code, the `freq` parameter is correctly passed and utilized when creating a new instance of the TimedeltaIndex. This should resolve the issue related to the incorrect handling of the `freq` parameter and ensure that the inferred frequency conforms to the passed frequency.
