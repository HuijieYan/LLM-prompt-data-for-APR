The test case `test_infer_from_tdi_mismatch` is checking whether an error is raised when creating a `TimedeltaIndex` with a frequency that does not match the frequency inferred from the input `tdi`. It uses the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor with the `tdi` as the data and a different frequency than the one inferred.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is the logic for checking and handling the frequency mismatch. It seems that the logic for handling this scenario is not correctly implemented, leading to the failure of the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for comparing and handling the inferred frequency with the passed frequency is not correctly implemented in the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor.

To fix the bug, the logic for comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency should be checked and corrected. It seems like the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not correctly handling the case when the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and name is None:
        if data.inferred_freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency '{data.inferred_freq}' from passed values does not match passed frequency '{freq}'."
            )
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to compare the inferred frequency from the passed values with the passed frequency. If they do not match, a `ValueError` is raised, which aligns with the behavior expected by the test case.
