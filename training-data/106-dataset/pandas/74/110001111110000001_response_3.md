The error message indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` is failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected when it is instantiated with a specified frequency that does not match the inferred frequency from the passed values. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the frequency validation is handled in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class in the file `timedeltas.py`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the inferred frequency is compared with the passed frequency. This is likely where the logic is not working as intended.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency. As a result, the function is not raising the expected `ValueError` when the frequencies do not match.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the inferred frequency and the passed frequency needs to be corrected. Additionally, any conditional statements or logic related to frequency validation need to be reviewed and potentially updated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    inferred_freq = tdarr.freq
    if inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
        )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
In the corrected code, after inferring the frequency from the passed values, we compare it with the passed frequency. If they do not match, a `ValueError` is raised as expected.
