Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the section that checks for the input parameters and their types. It seems to be expecting certain inputs and throwing errors or warnings if they don't adhere to those expectations.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The function is not handling some input parameters and their types properly.
2. It is not checking for all possible cases and handling them appropriately.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Add additional checks to ensure that all input parameters are of the correct type and handle them accordingly.
2. Consider restructuring the function to handle different types of input more flexibly, allowing for a wider range of valid inputs.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(cls, data=None, unit=None, freq=None, closed=None, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False, name=None,):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed")

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError("Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not represent unambiguous timedelta values durations.")

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    if isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(data.dtype, np.timedelta64):
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray(data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid input type: {type(data)}")
