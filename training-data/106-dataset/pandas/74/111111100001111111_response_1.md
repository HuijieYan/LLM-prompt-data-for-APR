The potential error in the __new__ function lies around the call to _simple_new. The error message suggests that there is a problem with this call, and it also indicates that the input data is being checked for its type before reaching the code where the call to _simple_new occurs.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to call _simple_new directly on the class (cls variable), but the _simple_new method is defined as a class method, so the cls parameter should not be passed explicitly. 

To fix the bug, the _simple_new method should be called without passing cls as an argument. Since cls is the current class (TimedeltaIndex), it automatically becomes the first argument when calling _simple_new.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)  # Changed cls._simple_new to just _simple_new

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)  # Changed cls._simple_new to just _simple_new
```
