The error message indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")` is called.

Looking at the code provided, it seems that the bug is likely located in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The bug may be related to how the method handles the frequency mismatch when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex`.

The error occurs due to the failure to raise a `ValueError` when `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")` is called. This suggests that the frequency mismatch is not being properly validated within the `__new__` method.

To fix this bug, you can add a validation check for the frequency mismatch within the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. If the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the passed frequency, a `ValueError` should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # New validation for frequency mismatch
    if freq and unit and isinstance(data, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if infer_freq(data) != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
            )

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

By adding a validation check for the frequency mismatch and raising a `ValueError` if necessary, we can address the bug and ensure that the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class behaves as expected.
