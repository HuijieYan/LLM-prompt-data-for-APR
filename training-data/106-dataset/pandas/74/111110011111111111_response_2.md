The error message is indicating that the TimedeltaIndex constructor is not raising a ValueError as expected in one of the test cases.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the problem might be in the condition checking for "Inferred frequency" from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency. This condition check is not properly handled in the buggy function.

The reason behind this bug is that the condition checking for "Inferred frequency" from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency is not properly implemented in the buggy function. It is failing to raise a ValueError as expected.

To fix this bug, the condition checking for the "Inferred frequency" from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency needs to be accurately implemented in the __new__ method.

The corrected code for the __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    if freq and freq != getattr(data, 'freq', freq):
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
``` 

This corrected __new__ method now includes a condition check for the "Inferred frequency" from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency, and it will raise a ValueError as expected in the mentioned test case.
