The error message indicates a `ValueError` is not being raised while it is expected during the test case `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None` condition, where the `freq` is not being validated properly.

The bug occurs because the `freq` parameter is not being checked correctly. The function should raise a `ValueError` when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the `freq` input.

To fix the bug, we need to add a validation check for the frequency mismatch and raise a `ValueError` as indicated in the error message if there is a mismatch.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Check for freq mismatch
    inferred_freq = infer_freq(data)
    if inferred_freq and freq and inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError("Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency")

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

With this correction, the function will raise a `ValueError` if the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the `freq` input.
