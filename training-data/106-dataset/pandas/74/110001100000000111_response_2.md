Potential error location: 
The main issue in the provided code is that the indentation of the function `__new__` is incorrect. As a result, it is not properly aligned with the class definition, leading to a syntax error.

Reason behind the bug:
The indentation of the `__new__` function is incorrect, causing it to be considered as part of the global namespace rather than as a method of the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `__new__` function is properly indented to be a part of the class.
2. Check for any other syntax errors in the function body.

Corrected code:

```python
def _simple_new(cls, values, name=None, freq=None, dtype=_TD_DTYPE):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class ClassName:  # replace with the actual class name
    # ... other class methods ...
    
   # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __new__(
        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,
        closed=None,
        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )
    
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
    
        # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
