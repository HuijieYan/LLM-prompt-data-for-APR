Potential Error Location:
The bug could be located in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The error message indicates that it did not raise a ValueError as expected when invoked with `tdi._data` and `freq="D"`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug could be due to the incorrect handling of the `freq` parameter and the data passed to the `TimedeltaIndex` class. It seems that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the `freq` and the inferred frequency from the passed values to ensure they conform to each other.
2. Ensure that the correct data type and format are passed to the `TimedeltaIndex` class.
3. Verify the handling of `freq` and its compatibility with the passed data.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python

        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,

        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )
    
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )

        # Validate the frequency and inferred frequency
        if freq is not None and data is not None:
            inferred_freq = maybe_infer_format(data, freq=freq)
            if inferred_freq != freq:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency"
                )

        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
    
        # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
