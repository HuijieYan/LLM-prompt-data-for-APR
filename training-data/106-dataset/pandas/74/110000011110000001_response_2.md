The error message indicates that the function `TimedeltaIndex` did not raise a `ValueError` as expected. The test is checking whether an invalid frequency is detected and raises a `ValueError` as specified.

The potential error in the provided function seems to be the conversion of the `tdi._data` to `TimedeltaIndex` with a different frequency (`freq="D"`) than the one inferred from the `tdi` data. This could be causing the function to not raise the expected `ValueError`.

The bug occurs because the function is failing to check for the mismatch in frequency when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be adjusted to explicitly check for the mismatch in frequency when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex` or `TimedeltaArray` from the given input data.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and (freq is None or data.freq != freq) and name is None:
        if copy:
            return cls._simple_new(data._data, name=data.name, freq=freq)
        else:
            return cls._simple_new(data._data, name=data.name, freq=data.freq)

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly check for the mismatch in frequency when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex` or `TimedeltaArray` from the given input data. This approach should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected when handling mismatched frequencies.
