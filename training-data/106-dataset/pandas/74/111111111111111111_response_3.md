The error message in the test case indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` function is not correctly raising a `ValueError` as expected. This suggests that the logic within the `TimedeltaIndex` function is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` function could be in the `__new__` method, particularly in the logic that handles the input data and frequency (`freq`).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the check for the inferred frequency from the passed values not conforming to the passed frequency is not functioning properly. This results in the `ValueError` not being raised when expected.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correctly compare the inferred frequency from the passed values with the passed frequency and raise a `ValueError` if they do not conform. This comparison logic needs to be accurately implemented within the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Check if the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the passed frequency
    if isinstance(data, (np.ndarray, ABCSeries)):
        inferred_freq = getattr(data, "freq", None)
        if inferred_freq is not None:
            if not is_scalar(inferred_freq):
                inferred_freq = inferred_freq.inferred_freq
            if freq is not None and freq != inferred_freq:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
                )

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, additional checks are added to compare the inferred frequency with the passed frequency, and a `ValueError` is raised if they do not conform. This change should address the issue and ensure that the `ValueError` is raised as expected in the test case.
