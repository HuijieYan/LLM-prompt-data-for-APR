The buggy function `__new__` in the class `TimedeltaIndex` is called with an array of shape (100,) as the input parameter `data`. Within the function, there is a check for whether the input data is an instance of `TimedeltaArray`. If the input data is an instance of `TimedeltaArray`, then the function calls `data.copy()` and then `_simple_new` method. The error arises from the fact that the function expects `data` to be an instance of `TimedeltaArray` before trying to call the `copy` method on it. But in the provided test case, it is clear that `data` is an array and not an instance of `TimedeltaArray`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to first check if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` before attempting to call the `copy` method on it. If `data` is not an instance of `TimedeltaArray`, we can convert it to a `TimedeltaArray` before further processing.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Convert data to TimedeltaArray
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
