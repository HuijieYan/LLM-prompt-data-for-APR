Potential error location: 
The error might be occurring in the logic for creating a new instance of the TimedeltaIndex class. The if conditions and return statements within the __new__ method seem to be causing the issue.


Reasons behind the bug:
1. The if statements might not be handling all the possible cases for creating a new TimedeltaIndex instance.
2. The logic for checking the type of input data and handling it accordingly might be incorrect.
3. The conditions for checking the unit and handling the ValueError might not be accurate.
4. There could be issues with the creation of the TimedeltaArray and calling the _simple_new method.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditions for creating a new instance of TimedeltaIndex and make sure all possible cases are handled.
2. Check the logic for handling input data and unit to ensure it is correct and comprehensive.
3. Validate the creation of TimedeltaArray and calling of _simple_new method to ensure they are functioning properly.


Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if data is None:
        data = []

    if not is_list_like(data):
        raise TypeError(f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a collection of some kind")

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
