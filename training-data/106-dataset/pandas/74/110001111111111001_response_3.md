The error message indicates that the TimedeltaIndex function is not raising a ValueError as expected when the frequency does not match the passed values.

The potential error is in the implementation of the __new__ method of the TimedeltaIndex class. It seems that the frequency validation and corresponding ValueError raise are not working correctly.

The bug is likely occurring because the condition to check for frequency matching is not properly implemented. As a result, the function is not raising the ValueError when the frequency does not match the passed values.

To fix the bug, the frequency validation logic should be reviewed and updated. This may involve checking if the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the passed frequency and raising a ValueError if it does not match.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method of the TimedeltaIndex class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
  
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

This corrected implementation should address the bug by properly checking and raising a ValueError if the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.
