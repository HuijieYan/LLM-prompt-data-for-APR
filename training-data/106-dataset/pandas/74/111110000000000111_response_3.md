The potential error in the given code is with the __new__ method within the TimedeltaIndex class. The error occurs because the code does not properly handle the inputs and conditions for creating a new TimedeltaIndex.

The first issue is with the check for a scalar value in the input data. The code raises a TypeError if the input is a scalar, which is not desirable behavior.

The second issue is with the check for the unit being 'Y' or 'M'. The code raises a ValueError for these units, but the error message is not clear and the behavior is not well-described.

To fix the issues, the code should handle the input data and unit correctly and provide clear error messages if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    # Check if data is None or a scalar
    if data is None:
        data = []  # Create an empty list if data is None
    elif np.isscalar(data):
        data = [data]  # Convert scalar to a list

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        # Raise a clear ValueError message for unsupported units
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported as they do not represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    # Convert data to TimedeltaArray if it's not already
    if not isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        data = TimedeltaArray(data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    # Create a new instance of TimedeltaIndex using _simple_new method
    return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
```
In the corrected code, we handle the input data more appropriately and provide clear error messages for unsupported units. Additionally, we create an instance of TimedeltaArray if the input data is not already in that format, and then use the _simple_new method to create a new TimedeltaIndex instance.
