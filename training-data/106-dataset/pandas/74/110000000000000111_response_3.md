Potential Error:
The potential error in the given function is that the `__new__` method is missing the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `self` parameter is missing from the `__new__` method. In Python, the `__new__` method should always take the `cls` parameter as the first argument, followed by any other parameters. In this case, `self` is missing, which is causing the error.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding the `self` parameter as the first argument in the `__new__` method, followed by the other parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def __new__(
    cls,
    self,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
