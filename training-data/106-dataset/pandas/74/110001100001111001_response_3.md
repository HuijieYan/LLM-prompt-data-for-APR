Potential error location: The bug is likely to occur in the if statement where the unit is checked for being in {"Y", "y", "M"}. This is because the function raises a ValueError if the unit is "M" or "Y", but the expected output does not include this as a valid input. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the input validation for the unit is not aligned with the expected input parameters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the if statement that checks for "M" and "Y" as valid input units, since these units are not supposed to be checked and are not included in the expected inputs. 

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=np.dtype('m8[ns]'),
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
