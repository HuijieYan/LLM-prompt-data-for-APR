The error message from the test function indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor did not raise a `ValueError` as expected when `tdi._data` and `freq="D"` were passed as arguments. This means that the constructor did not properly handle the case where the inferred frequency from the data does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None` block. It seems to be incorrectly handling the case where the inferred frequency from the data does not match the passed frequency.

The bug occurs because the condition `if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None` suggests that if the data is of type `TimedeltaIndex` and the frequency is not specified, then the constructor should return a shallow or deep copy of the data without checking if the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the constructor should include a check to compare the inferred frequency from the data with the passed frequency and raise a `ValueError` if they don't conform.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        inferred_freq = getattr(data, "freq", None)
        if inferred_freq is not None and inferred_freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                "Inferred frequency does not conform to passed frequency"
            )
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
