Potential Error:
The potential error in the __new__ method is that it is not returning the cls._simple_new function properly based on the conditions.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the __new__ method is not properly handling the conditions and returning the cls._simple_new function with the correct arguments.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the conditions are properly handling the input parameters and returning the correct value based on the conditions.
2. Ensure that the cls._simple_new function is called with the correct arguments and returned properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq, dtype=dtype)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq, dtype=dtype)
```
