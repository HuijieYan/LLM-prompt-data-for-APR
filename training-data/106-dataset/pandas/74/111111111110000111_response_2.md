The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The method is not handling the case where the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The bug occurred because the conditional logic in the `__new__` method does not handle the situation where the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to check whether the inferred frequency conforms to the passed frequency and raise a `ValueError` if it does not.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray) and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {data.freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

This modification introduces a new check after the `isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray)` conditional block, which checks if the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the passed frequency. If it does not, a `ValueError` is raised with the corresponding message.
