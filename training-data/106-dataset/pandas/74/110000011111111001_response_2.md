The error message suggests that the `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` methods are failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected. This means that the error handling within these methods is not working as intended.

Looking at the provided function, the potential error location seems to be the handling of the `freq` parameter and its mismatch with the inferred frequency from the passed values. The bug is likely due to incorrect validation of the frequency parameter against the inferred frequency.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly validate the frequency parameter against the inferred frequency. Additionally, the error handling logic for these cases should be improved to ensure that the appropriate `ValueError` is raised when the frequency mismatch occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Infer the frequency from the passed data and validate against the provided frequency
    inferred_freq = infer_freq(data)
    if freq and inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the function now includes a check to infer the frequency from the passed data and validate it against the provided `freq` parameter. If there is a mismatch, the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
