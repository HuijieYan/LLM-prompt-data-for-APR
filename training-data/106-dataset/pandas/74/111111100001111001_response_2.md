The potential error location in the provided function is in the usage of the `_simple_new` method. It is likely that this method should be used with the `cls` class, but it is being called directly on `cls` instead.

The error message indicates that the method `_simple_new` is expected to be called on `TimedeltaIndex` class, but it is being called on an instance of `TimedeltaIndex` instead. This suggests that the method should be a class method (or a static method) rather than an instance method.

To fix this bug, the `_simple_new` method should be declared as a class method. By adding the `@classmethod` decorator before its definition, we can make sure that it is attached to the class rather than to instances of the class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(cls, data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(cls, tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, the `cls` parameter is passed to the `_simple_new` method to ensure that it is called as a class method. This should resolve the bug.
