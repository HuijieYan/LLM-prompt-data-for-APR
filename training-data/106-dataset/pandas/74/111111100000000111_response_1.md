The error in the provided code is located in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. 

The potential error in this method is the incorrect use of the `_simple_new` method. The function is accessed as `cls._simple_new` instead of `self._simple_new`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_simple_new` method should be called using `self` instead of `cls` because it is an instance method.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should be updated to use `self._simple_new` instead of `cls._simple_new`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return self._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
