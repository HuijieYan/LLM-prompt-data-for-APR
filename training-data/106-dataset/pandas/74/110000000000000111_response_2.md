Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the `self` parameter, indicating that it might be a method of a class.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the function is missing the `self` parameter, which is used to refer to the instance of the class. Without the `self` parameter, the function cannot access the attributes and methods of the class.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the function parameters, indicating that it is a method of a class.
2. Ensure that the function has access to the class attributes and methods by using the `self` parameter.
3. Review any other class methods that interact with this method to ensure they are correctly passing and utilizing the `self` parameter.

Corrected Code:
```python
# This is the corrected function
def __new__(
    self,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, self)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{self.__class__.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return self._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return self._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
