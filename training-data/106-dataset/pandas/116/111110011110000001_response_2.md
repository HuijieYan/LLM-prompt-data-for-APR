The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the data types of the merge keys. Specifically, the error message states "incompatible merge keys [0] dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], must be the same type", which suggests that there is a mismatch between the data types of the merge keys.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the left and right keys are being assigned, specifically the points where the data types of the keys are being compared.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the fact that the code is not handling the data types of the merge keys properly, resulting in a mismatch between the data types of the left and right keys.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the data types of the left and right keys are compatible before performing the merge operation. This could involve casting the data types to a common type or handling the data type conversion in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # In the section below, ensure that the data types of the left and right keys are compatible
    for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
        if lk.dtype != rk.dtype:
            # Convert the data type of one of the keys to match the other
            if lk.dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
                rk = rk.astype('datetime64[ns, UTC]')
            else:
                lk = lk.astype('datetime64[ns, UTC]')

        left_keys.append(lk)
        right_keys.append(rk)
        join_names.append(None)  # what to do?

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This corrected code ensures that the data types of the left and right keys are compatible before returning them for the merge operation, resolving the data type mismatch issue.
