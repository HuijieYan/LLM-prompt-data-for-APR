The buggy function `_get_merge_keys` seems to have an issue with the logic used to populate the `left_keys`, `right_keys`, and `join_names` lists. It is also not clear how the `is_lkey` and `is_rkey` functions are being used in this context. The bug seems to be a result of improper handling of the conditional checks and assignment of values to the lists in the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the complex logic and conditional handling within the function. Additionally, the use of lambda functions `is_lkey` and `is_rkey` can also lead to confusion about what type of inputs they are expecting.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to simplify the conditional logic and ensure that the values are properly assigned to the correct lists based on the conditions. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the lambda functions `is_lkey` and `is_rkey` are utilized correctly and return the expected boolean values.

Here's the corrected version of the code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    for i in range(len(self.left_on)):
        if is_array_like(self.left_on[i]):
            left_keys.append(self.left_on[i])
            if is_array_like(self.right_on[i]):
                right_keys.append(self.right_on[i])
                join_names.append(None)  # what to do?
            else:
                if self.right_on[i] is not None:
                    right_keys.append(right[self.right_on[i]])
                    join_names.append(self.right_on[i])
                else:
                    right_keys.append(right.index)
                    join_names.append(right.index.name)
        else:
            if not is_array_like(self.right_on[i]):
                if self.right_on[i] is not None:
                    right_keys.append(right[self.right_on[i]])
                else:
                    right_keys.append(right.index)
                if self.left_on[i] is not None and self.left_on[i] == self.right_on[i]:
                    if len(left) > 0:
                        right_drop.append(self.right_on[i])
                    else:
                        left_drop.append(self.left_on[i])
            else:
                right_keys.append(self.right_on[i])
            if self.left_on[i] is not None:
                left_keys.append(left[self.left_on[i]])
                join_names.append(self.left_on[i])
            else:
                left_keys.append(left.index)
                join_names.append(left.index.name)

    if left_drop:
        self.left = self.left.drop(left_drop)

    if right_drop:
        self.right = self.right.drop(right_drop)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
In this corrected version, the conditional logic has been simplified and the lambda functions `is_lkey` and `is_rkey` have been removed in favor of more direct conditional checks. This should help in resolving the issues observed in the original implementation.
