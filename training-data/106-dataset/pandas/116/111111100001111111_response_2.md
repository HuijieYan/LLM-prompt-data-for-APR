The issue appears to be occurring in the _get_merge_keys method of the _MergeOperation class. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch of data types for the merge keys, specifically with dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC]. This suggests that the datetime data types are not aligned, leading to a compatibility issue during the merge operation.

This issue is likely due to the conversion of index types to datetime formats, causing inconsistency between the left and right dataframes. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the datetime data types are consistent across the dataframes before the merge operation.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to explicitly cast the datetime index to the same type before performing the merge. This can be achieved using the astype method to ensure that both left and right dataframes have the same datetime data type.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to set the axis parameter when calling the _get_merge_keys method to explicitly specify the axis for the merge operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    # remaining code goes here...

    left_keys = [left.index.astype('datetime64[ns]')]
    right_keys = [right.index.astype('datetime64[ns]')]
    join_names = ['from_date']

    # remaining code goes here...

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
