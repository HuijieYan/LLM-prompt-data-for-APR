The bug occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The method has side effects such as copy and delete key columns. The bug is related to the types of left and right keys not being compatible, resulting in a `MergeError` while merging.

The bug is likely caused by inconsistent types in the left and right keys. This inconsistency could be due to the non-uniform handling of the keys in the code that leads to the left and right keys being of different types.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling left and right keys should be revised to ensure that the keys are of the same type before merging to avoid the `MergeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = self.left.index
    right_keys = self.right[self.right_on[0]]

    # Ensure that left and right keys are of the same type
    if not left_keys.dtype == right_keys.dtype:
        left_keys = left_keys.astype(right_keys.dtype)

    join_names = [self.right_on[0]]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we check the types of left and right keys, and if they are not the same, we convert the left keys to the type of the right keys to ensure compatibility. This should resolve the inconsistency issue and prevent the `MergeError` from occurring during merging.
