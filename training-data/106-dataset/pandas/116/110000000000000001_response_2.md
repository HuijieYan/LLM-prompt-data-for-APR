The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition checks for `_any(self.left_on)` and `_any(self.right_on)`. These checks seem to be causing issues with how the left and right keys are being populated.

The bug occurs because the condition checks for `_any(self.left_on)` and `_any(self.right_on)` are not handling the logic correctly, resulting in incorrect left and right key populations. This is leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to revisit the condition checks for `_any(self.left_on)` and `_any(self.right_on)` and ensure that they are correctly checking for the presence of left and right keys. Additionally, reviewing the logic for populating the left and right keys based on these conditions is necessary to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if self.left_on and self.right_on:
        for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
            if lk is not None:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(lk))
                join_names.append(lk)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left.index)
                join_names.append(left.index.name)

            if rk is not None:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
                join_names.append(rk)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right.index)
                join_names.append(right.index.name)
    elif self.left_on:
        for k in self.left_on:
            if k is not None:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(k))
                join_names.append(k)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left.index)
                join_names.append(left.index.name)
            right_keys.append(self.right.index)
    elif self.right_on:
        for k in self.right_on:
            left_keys.append(self.left.index)
            if k is not None:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(k))
                join_names.append(k)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right.index)
                join_names.append(right.index.name)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
In the corrected code, the logic for populating left and right keys has been simplified to ensure that the correct values are being appended to `left_keys` and `right_keys` based on the conditions provided. Additionally, the condition checks have been revised to properly handle the presence of left and right keys.
