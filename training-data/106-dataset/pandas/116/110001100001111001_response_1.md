The `_get_merge_keys` function takes in two parameters `self` which is an instance of the `_AsOfMerge` class, and `left` and `right` which are DataFrames. It tries to extract the key columns to be used for merging the left and right DataFrames.

The potential issues in the function are:
1. The function is defined inside another function `_any` which may cause scoping issues.
2. The function does not take `left`, `right`, and `on` as parameters, which are mentioned in the docstring.
3. Some operations with `self.left_on` and `self.right_on` lists may not work as expected.

To fix this, the function needs to:
1. Remove the surrounding function `_any` and adjust the definition of `_get_merge_keys` to accept parameters `left` and `right`.
2. Make sure to handle cases where `self.left_on` and `self.right_on` are not lists properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, on):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
        left DataFrame to be merged
    right : DataFrame
        right DataFrame to be merged
    on : list
        columns to be used for merging

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = left.index if not on else left[on]
    right_keys = right.index if not on else right[on]
    join_names = on if on else None
    
    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
