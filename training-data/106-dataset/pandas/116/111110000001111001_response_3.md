The bug in the provided function is due to the array structures and conditional statements used. The function is trying to identify keys for merging two dataframes but due to conditional checks and loops, the expected output is not being generated.

To resolve the bug, the function should correctly check for the type of the input key and add it to the relevant array. Additionally, it should handle the `None` values properly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if self.left_on[0] is None:
        left_keys = left.index
        join_names.append(left.index.name)
    else:
        left_keys = left[self.left_on[0]]
        join_names.append(self.left_on[0])

    if self.right_on[0] is None:
        right_keys = right.index
        join_names.append(right.index.name)
    else:
        right_keys = right[self.right_on[0]]
        join_names.append(self.right_on[0])

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, the function directly checks if the key is None for both left and right dataframes. If it is None, it adds the dataframe index to the left_keys and right_keys arrays. Otherwise, it uses the specified key for selection.

This approach simplifies the logic and should provide the correct output for identifying keys for the merge operation.
