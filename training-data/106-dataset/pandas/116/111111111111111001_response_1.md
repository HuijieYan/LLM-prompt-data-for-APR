The error occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_MergeOperation` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys of different types.

The bug occurs because the left and right keys are being extracted and processed incorrectly. This leads to a mismatch in key types, causing the merge error.

To fix the bug:
- Ensure that the left and right keys are extracted and processed correctly to avoid type mismatches.
- Check the type of the keys before merging and handle any type mismatches appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right
    left_index = self.left_index
    right_index = self.right_index

    if left_index and right_on is not None:
        left_keys.append(left.index)
        right_keys.append(right[right_on])
        join_names.append(None)
    elif right_index and left_on is not None:
        left_keys.append(left[left_on])
        right_keys.append(right.index)
        join_names.append(None)
    
    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, the left and right keys are extracted and processed based on the conditions of `left_index` and `right_index`, ensuring that the types match properly. This should resolve the type mismatch issue and prevent the merge error.
