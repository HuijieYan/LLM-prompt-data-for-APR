The error message indicates that there is an issue with the merge keys being of different types, specifically `<M8[ns]` and `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. This suggests that the `_get_merge_keys` function is not handling the merge keys correctly, resulting in this mismatch.

The issue is likely occurring because the function is not correctly determining the types of the merge keys and handling them appropriately. The code is failing to handle the timezone-aware datetime objects properly, leading to the type mismatch.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle timezone-aware datetime objects and ensure that the merge keys are of the same type.

Below is the fixed version of the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if self.left_index and self.right_on:
        right_keys = [pd.to_datetime(self.right[self.right_on[0]]).values]
        left_keys = [self.left.index.values]
        join_names = [self.right_on[0]]
    elif self.right_index and self.left_on:
        left_keys = [pd.to_datetime(self.left[self.left_on[0]]).values]
        right_keys = [self.right.index.values]
        join_names = [self.left_on[0]]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid combination for merge keys")

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the merge keys, ensuring that they are of the same type and accounting for timezone-aware datetime objects.

After making this change, the `pd.merge_asof` function should work correctly without raising the `MergeError` related to incompatible merge keys.
