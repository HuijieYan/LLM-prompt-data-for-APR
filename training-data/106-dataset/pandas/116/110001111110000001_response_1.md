The error message indicates that the bug is likely happening in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The error is related to incompatible merge keys (left and right join keys).

The reason behind the bug is that the merge keys of the left and right data frames are not being handled properly, leading to incompatible merge keys in the merge operation.

To fix the bug, the merge keys of the left and right data frames should be processed correctly to ensure that they are compatible. Additionally, if the data frame has a timezone, it needs to be handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if self.left_index and self.right_index:
        left_keys = left.index
        right_keys = right.index
    elif self.left_index and self.right_on:
        left_keys = left.index
        right_keys = right[self.right_on]
    elif self.left_on and self.right_index:
        left_keys = left[self.left_on]
        right_keys = right.index
    else:  # both left_on and right_on are specified
        left_keys = left[self.left_on]
        right_keys = right[self.right_on]

    if isinstance(left_keys, pd.DatetimeIndex) and isinstance(right_keys, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        left_keys = left_keys.tz_localize(None)
        right_keys = right_keys.tz_localize(None)

    return left_keys, right_keys, None
```

This corrected method properly handles the different merge key scenarios and ensures that the timezone is handled appropriately if the keys are datetime indexes.
