Based on the error message, it seems that the issue occurs when the dtype of the merge keys is being validated in the `_get_merge_keys` function within the `_MergeOperation` class. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the dtype of the merge keys, specifically between `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

Potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code could be incorrectly handling the dtype validation of the merge keys, leading to the mismatch error.
2. There could be an issue with how the merge keys are being extracted and compared within the `_get_merge_keys` function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the dtype comparison logic within the `_get_merge_keys` function to handle the merge keys' dtype properly.
2. Verify that the merge keys are being extracted and processed correctly to avoid any dtype mismatches.

The corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:
```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    # Extract the left and right keys
    left_key = left.index if self.left_index else left.get(self.left_on)
    right_key = right.index if self.right_index else right.get(self.right_on)

    # Verify and handle dtype validation for the merge keys
    if left_key.dtype != right_key.dtype:
        raise MergeError(f"Incompatible merge keys: {left_key.dtype} and {right_key.dtype}, must be the same type")

    left_keys.append(left_key)
    right_keys.append(right_key)
    join_names.append(None)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
In this corrected version of the `_get_merge_keys` function, the left and right merge keys are appropriately extracted and compared to ensure that their dtypes match. This should address the issue mentioned in the error message.
