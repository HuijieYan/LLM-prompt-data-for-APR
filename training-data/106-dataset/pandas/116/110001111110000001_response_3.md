The test case `test_merge_index_column_tz` is trying to merge two DataFrames using the `pd.merge_asof` function. The function is called with the `left_index=True` and `right_on=["from_date"]` parameters, which means it should merge the left DataFrame using its index and the right DataFrame using the "from_date" column.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys. Specifically, it mentions that the merge keys have different types and they should be the same type.

After analyzing the code of the `_get_merge_keys` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the data types of the merge keys. It's possible that the data types of the merge keys extracted from the left and right DataFrames are different, causing the error.

To fix this issue, the code needs to ensure that the data types of the merge keys extracted from the left and right DataFrames match before performing the merge.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    for key in self.left_on:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            left_keys.append(left[key].values)
            join_names.append(key)
        else:
            left_keys.append(key)
            join_names.append(None)

    for key in self.right_on:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            right_keys.append(right[key].values)
            join_names.append(key)
        else:
            right_keys.append(key)
            join_names.append(None)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This corrected code extracts the merge keys directly from the left and right DataFrames, ensuring that they are of the same type and can be used for merging without causing the type incompatibility error.
