Potential error location: The bug in the function appears to be related to the condition check and logic for determining the left and right keys and their corresponding join names.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The condition checks for determining left and right keys appear to be complex and may not cover all possible cases.
2. There is confusion between when to use the left_on and right_on parameters, leading to incorrect determination of the keys.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the condition checks and logic for determining left and right keys.
2. Clearly specify the use of left_on and right_on parameters to avoid confusion.

Corrected code:
```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, on):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    if on:
        left_keys = left[on]
        right_keys = right[on]
        join_names = on
    else:
        left_keys = left.index
        right_keys = right.index
        join_names = [left.index.name, right.index.name]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
