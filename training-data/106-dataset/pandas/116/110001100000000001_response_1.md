The potential error in the code seems to be in the section where it is trying to determine the left_keys and right_keys based on the conditions specified. It seems to be using lambda functions and _any() function to determine the keys, but it is not clear how these functions are implemented or whether they are even necessary.

The error seems to be occurring due to incorrect implementation of logic for determining left_keys and right_keys based on the conditions for self.left_on and self.right_on.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to simplify the logic for determining left_keys and right_keys based on the conditions. Remove the unnecessary lambda functions and _any() function and use simple if-else conditions to determine the keys.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, on):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    # Determine left_keys and right_keys based on the conditions
    if self.left_on and self.right_on:
        for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
            if isinstance(lk, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(lk) == len(left):
                left_keys.append(lk)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(lk))
            if isinstance(rk, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(rk) == len(right):
                right_keys.append(rk)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
            join_names.append(None)  # what to do?

    elif self.left_on:
        for k in self.left_on:
            if isinstance(k, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(k) == len(left):
                left_keys.append(k)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(k))
            join_names.append(None)

    elif self.right_on:
        for k in self.right_on:
            if isinstance(k, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(k) == len(right):
                right_keys.append(k)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(k))
            join_names.append(None)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
