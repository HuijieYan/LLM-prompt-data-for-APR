The bug in the given code seems to be due to the incorrect indentation of the `_get_merge_keys` method. This method is included within the `_AsOfMerge` class, indicated by the `self` parameter. However, this method is not properly indented and is not aligned with the class structure.

To fix this bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method needs to be properly indented and aligned with the `_AsOfMerge` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    is_lkey = lambda x: is_array_like(x) and len(x) == len(left)
    is_rkey = lambda x: is_array_like(x) and len(x) == len(right)

    # ... (rest of the method)

    if left_drop:
        self.left = self.left._drop_labels_or_levels(left_drop)

    if right_drop:
        self.right = self.right._drop_labels_or_levels(right_drop)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_merge_keys` method is indented properly within the class `_AsOfMerge`. This should resolve the issue and allow the method to execute correctly.
