## Issue Analysis
The error message indicates a problem with the merge keys data types. The expected merge keys data types are `datetime64[ns]` and `DateTime[ns, UTC]`, but they should be of the same type. This suggests that the bug is likely located within the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `pandas.core.reshape.merge._AsOfMerge` class.

The function is failing to ensure that the merge keys have the same data types, resulting in a `MergeError`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle the case where the data types of the merge keys are different. The expected merge keys should have the same data type, but the code does not have a mechanism to verify and handle this situation.

## Possible Approaches
1. Add logic to the function to validate the data types of merge keys and raise an error or perform type conversion if they are not the same.
2. Ensure that the merge keys are converted to the same data type before performing the merge.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on
    
    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    # ... existing code ...

    # ensure merge keys have the same data type
    if len(left_keys) > 0 and len(right_keys) > 0:
        if left_keys[0].dtype != right_keys[0].dtype:
            left_keys = [left_keys[0].astype(right_keys[0].dtype)]
            # also convert the original merge keys to the same type
            join_names[0] = join_names[0] if (join_names[0] is not None) else right_keys[0].name

    # ... existing code ...

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we add a validation step to ensure that the data types of the merge keys are the same. If the data types are different, we convert the first merge key in `left_keys` to the data type of the first merge key in `right_keys`. We also update the `join_names` accordingly.

Please note that the suggested code modification is based on the assumption that the data type of the first merge key is representative of the entire merge keys. If this assumption is not valid, further adjustments might be necessary.
