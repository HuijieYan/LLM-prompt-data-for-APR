I can't run the code provided, but I can see that the function `_get_merge_keys` is designed to create left keys, right keys, join names, and other parameters for performing a merge operation.

The bug seems to be related to the logic of populating the `left_keys` and `right_keys` lists. The `if-else` conditions inside the nested `for` loops are complex and might be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the logical flow of populating `left_keys` and `right_keys` should be reviewed and simplified. There might be redundant or unnecessary checks and conditions within the `if-else` blocks.

After reviewing and simplifying the logic, the fixed and simplified `_get_merge_keys` function could be as follows:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
  
    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if not self.left_on and self.right_on:
        left_keys = left.index.to_list()
        right_keys = right[self.right_on[0]].to_list()
        join_names.append(self.right_on[0])
    elif self.left_on and not self.right_on:
        left_keys = left[self.left_on[0]].to_list()
        right_keys = right.index.to_list()
        join_names.append(self.left_on[0])

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This refactored function simplifies the logic for populating `left_keys`, `right_keys`, and `join_names` based on the values of `self.left_on` and `self.right_on`. It removes the nested loops and lambda functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
