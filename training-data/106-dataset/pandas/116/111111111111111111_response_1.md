The bug occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_MergeOperation` class in the `merge.py` file. The function compares dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], which should be the same type. This is leading to the `MergeError`.

The reason behind this bug is a mismatch of data types between the left and right keys. The left key's data type is `dtype('<M8[ns]')`, while the right key's data type is `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

To fix this bug, the data types of the left and right keys should be consistent. This can be achieved by ensuring that the conversion to the same data type is performed for both the left and right keys.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
        left_key = left.index if lk is None else left[lk]
        right_key = right.index if rk is None else right[rk]
        
        if isinstance(left_key, pd.DatetimeIndex) and isinstance(right_key, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            right_keys.append(right_key)
            left_keys.append(left_key)
            join_names.append(lk)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Merge keys must be of the same type")

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
This correction ensures that the data types of both the left and right keys are consistent before merging, preventing the `MergeError` related to mismatched data types.
