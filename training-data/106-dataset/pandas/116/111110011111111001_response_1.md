The error occurs when the `_get_merge_keys` function is called within the `_AsOfMerge` class. The error message indicates that there is an incompatibility between the merge keys with different data types. The error is raised when comparing the data types of `left_join_keys` and `right_join_keys` within the `_get_merge_keys` function.

The potential error is that the data types of the merge keys (`left` and `right`) are not being handled correctly, leading to data type incompatibility.


To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of the merge keys are handled properly and are compatible before the comparison is made. This can be achieved by explicitly converting the data types of the keys to a common type if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    # ... (omitted the part where merge keys are extracted) ...

    # Convert the data types of merge keys to a common type if necessary
    if left_keys[0].dtype != right_keys[0].dtype:
        common_dtype = left_keys[0].dtype if left_keys[0].dtype.name != 'datetime64[ns, UTC]' else right_keys[0].dtype
        left_keys = [left_keys[0].astype(common_dtype)]
        right_keys = [right_keys[0].astype(common_dtype)]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, after extracting the merge keys, we explicitly check if their data types are different. If so, we convert the data type of the merge key that is not of the common type to the common type. This ensures that the merge keys have compatible data types before the comparison is made.
