The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys in the `_get_merge_keys` function in the `merge.py` file of the Pandas library. The error message specifies that the keys have different types, and they must be the same type.

The potential error location within the `_get_merge_keys` function is likely in the logic that processes the left and right keys for merging.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the keys have different types correctly. As a result, it is raising a `MergeError` when it encounters incompatible merge keys.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic for processing the left and right keys to ensure that they are of the same type before performing the merge. This can be done by checking the types of the keys and converting them if necessary to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, left_on, right_on):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left_on = left_on if left_on is not None else []
    right_on = right_on if right_on is not None else []

    for lk, rk in zip(left_on, right_on):
        if hasattr(left[lk], 'dtype') and hasattr(right[rk], 'dtype'):
            if left[lk].dtype != right[rk].dtype:
                # Convert types if necessary
                right[rk] = right[rk].astype(left[lk].dtype)
        left_keys.append(left[lk])
        right_keys.append(right[rk])
        join_names.append(lk)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check the types of the keys and convert them if necessary to ensure that they are of the same type before performing the merge. This correction should address the issue of incompatible merge keys and prevent the `MergeError` from being raised.
