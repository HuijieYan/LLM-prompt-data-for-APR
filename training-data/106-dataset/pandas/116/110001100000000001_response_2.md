The potential error location within the problematic function is the mismatch of function indentation and the missing function signature. This could be due to a copy-paste error or an incomplete code snippet.

The bug occurred because the function _get_merge_keys is not properly defined within the file. The indentation of the function and its missing signature are causing a syntax error. The function should be properly defined with the correct indentation and signature to avoid this bug.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    None
    
    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys, join_names
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    # ... Rest of the function remains unchanged ...
    
    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
