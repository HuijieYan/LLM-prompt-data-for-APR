The issue arises from a type mismatch error during the merge process in the `pd.merge_asof` function. This is evident from the error message: "incompatible merge keys [0] dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], must be the same type."

The bug occurs because when merging, the left and right keys from the index and 'on' columns should have the same dtype. However, the current function does not handle this properly, resulting in a type mismatch.

To fix this bug, the function needs to ensure that the left and right keys have the same dtype before performing the merge. This can be achieved by explicitly converting one of the datetime columns to UTC or by adjusting the comparison logic to handle different dtype cases.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    
    # Existing code remains the same
    
    # Ensure left and right keys have the same dtype
    if left_keys[0].dtype != right_keys[0].dtype:
        right_keys[0] = right_keys[0].astype(left_keys[0].dtype)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

By adding the provided condition to ensure the dtype match between left and right keys, we can fix the bug that causes the incompatible merge keys error. After integrating this fix, the test case for `pd.merge_asof` should pass successfully.
