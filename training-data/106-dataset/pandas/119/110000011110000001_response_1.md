The error message indicates that the data types of the DataFrame attributes are different. Specifically, the data type of an attribute is expected to be int64, but it is float64.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the computation of the margins, as the error message suggests a mismatch in the data type of the attributes.

The bug is likely occurring due to a mismatch in data types when generating the grand margin for the pivot table. This can occur if the calculations are made on different data types, resulting in inconsistent data types when constructing the pivot table.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the data types are consistent and appropriate. This can be achieved by casting the numerical values to a consistent data type (e.g., float) during computation of the grand margin or any other relevant calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Union, Tuple
import pandas as pd

def _add_margins(
    table: Union["pd.Series", "pd.DataFrame"],
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    # previous implementation goes here...

    key: Union[str, Tuple[str, ...]]
    if len(rows) > 1:
        key = (margins_name,) + ("",) * (len(rows) - 1)
    else:
        key = margins_name

    # Updated computation of grand margin to ensure consistent data type
    grand_margin = _compute_grand_margin(data, values, aggfunc, margins_name)
    grand_margin = grand_margin.astype(float)  # Cast to float to ensure consistency

    # ... remaining implementation
    return result
```

In the corrected code, after computing the grand margin, it is cast to float using the `astype` method to ensure consistent data types for numerical values. This should resolve the mismatch in data types that caused the bug.
