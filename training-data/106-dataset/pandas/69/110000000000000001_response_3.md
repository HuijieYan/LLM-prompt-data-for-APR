Potential Error Location: 
The potential error lies in the "is_integer" and "holds_integer" methods, as they are being called on "ax" which does not seem to be defined anywhere in the provided code.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the "ax" variable is not defined or initialized within the function, so calling methods on it will result in an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize or define the "ax" variable before using it in the loop.
2. Check if "ax" should be obtained from "self.obj.axes" or if it should be passed as a parameter to the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i,int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i,int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we have removed the undefined "ax" variable and instead used "ax" from "self.obj.axes" to iterate through the keys. Also, the validation condition for integer and non-integer indexes has been fixed.
