Potential error location: 
The bug occurs in the for loop where the function iterates through the axes of the object in "self" and compares the index type with the type of the key that is being passed. The bug likely occurs at the "if" conditions inside this loop.

Reason for the bug:
The condition checks whether the index type is integer or not, but the implementation of the condition is incorrect.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition to check if the index type is integer or floating point number and update the checks for the key type accordingly.
2. Update the name "is_floating" to "is_numeric" for accuracy.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric() and not is_numeric(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_numeric() and is_numeric(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In this corrected code, `ax.is_integer()` and `ax.holds_integer()` are replaced with `ax.is_numeric()` which checks whether the index type is numeric, and `is_integer(i)` is replaced with `is_numeric(i)` which checks whether the key type is numeric. These changes will ensure that the indexing is based on the correct types of indexers and keys.
