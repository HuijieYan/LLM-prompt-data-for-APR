The buggy function `convert_key` is designed to convert the key to a format matching the index. However, it has multiple issues. It seems to have been adapted from a different function and isn't well-suited for its purposes. The input parameters `key` and `is_setter` are not being used consistently. It attempts to iterate over the `axes` attribute of `self.obj`, but `axes` is not a supported attribute for a Series, which would lead to an AttributeError. Additionally, the checks for integer and floating values are inconsistent and unclear.

To fix the bug, we suggest the following approach:
1. Use a different approach to handle the conversion of the key based on the type of the index.
2. Replace the iteration over `axes` with a direct comparison of the key and index type.
3. Revise the checks for integer and floating values to ensure consistency and correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Convert the key to a format matching the index type.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype.type

    if index_type == np.float64:
        if not isinstance(key[0], float):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
    elif index_type == np.int64:
        if not isinstance(key[0], int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

This revised function directly checks the type of the index and the key and raises a ValueError for mismatched types. It also ensures consistency by checking the specific types of the index and key.
