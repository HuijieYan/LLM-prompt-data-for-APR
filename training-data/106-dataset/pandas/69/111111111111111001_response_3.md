The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The purpose of this method is to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. 

The error message indicates that the method is not handling non-integer indexes properly. It is failing when `is_integer(i)` is False since it should have raised a ValueError according to the comment. 

The bug occurs because the code mistakenly checks `ax.is_integer()` when it should have checked `ax.is_floating()` to handle non-integer indexes. 

To fix the bug, we need to change `ax.is_integer()` to `ax.is_floating()` in the else condition. Additionally, the variable `is_integer(i)` should be replaced by `isinstance(i, int)` to correctly check if `i` is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
