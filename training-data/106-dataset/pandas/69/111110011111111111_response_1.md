The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function due to type checking logic that does not properly handle integer and non-integer indexers for at-based indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the integer and non-integer indexers for at-based indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code includes the use of `pd.api.types.is_integer()` for proper type checking of integer values.

This updated logic should resolve the bug and allow for handling of either integer or non-integer indexers for at-based indexing.
