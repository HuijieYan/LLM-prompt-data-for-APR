The buggy function `_convert_key` has several issues:

1. In the line `if not is_integer(i):`, the function `is_integer` is being called without the proper prefix (e.g., `np.is_integer`).
2. The condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():` should be `if ax.is_integer() and not np.is_integer(i):`, as we are checking if the index is integer and the value is not.
3. It doesn't handle the case where the index is a `timedelta64` type and the value is a float.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the function as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Timedelta based indexing can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not (np.is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64Index based indexing can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not np.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function checks for both `TimedeltaIndex` and `Float64Index` types and appropriately handles the indexing based on their data types.
