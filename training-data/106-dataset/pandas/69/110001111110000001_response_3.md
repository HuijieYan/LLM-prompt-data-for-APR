The error message indicates a ValueError being raised in the `_convert_key` function within the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. It occurs when a non-integer index is used with an integer index.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the logic that checks whether the index is integer or non-integer and then compares it to the provided key. The error arises from this logic's inability to handle non-integer indexes properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current logic is not properly handling non-integer indexes when checking the key's type.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes by checking the type of the index and ensuring compatibility with the provided key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we properly check the type of the index (`ax`) and compare it to the key `i` for compatibility. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexes.
