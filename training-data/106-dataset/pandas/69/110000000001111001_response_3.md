The issue with the provided function is with the logic for checking whether the elements in the 'key' input are integers. The bug is likely to occur when the 'key' contains floats or integers and its axis also contains floats. The function incorrectly checks for integer type and does not handle floating point numbers correctly.

To fix this, we can modify the logic within the function to handle both integer and floating point numbers appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            if not ax.is_floating() and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
- We check if the element in the 'key' is either an integer or a float using `isinstance(i, (int, float))`.
- Depending on whether the axis requires floating or integer indexers, we raise an appropriate error message.
- We handle non-integer indexers in a separate condition.

This should address the issues with the original function and handle integer and floating point numbers correctly.
