The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. This method is used to enforce type consistency between the index and the key being used. In the test case, an error is raised when trying to perform "At based indexing on a non-integer index with non-integer indexers". This error is raised within the `_convert_key` method.

The issue arises because the method is not correctly handling the case where the index is a non-integer index and the key is also non-integer. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle the case where the index and key are non-integer.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` method is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i): # corrected function
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer(): # corrected function
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the `_convert_key` method now correctly handles the case of non-integer indexes and non-integer keys. This should resolve the issue and prevent the ValueError from being raised in the test case.
