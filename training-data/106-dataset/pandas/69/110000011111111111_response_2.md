The bug is occurring because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where the index is of type datetime64 or timedelta64 correctly. The function is checking if the index is of type float64, but it should also check for datetime64 and timedelta64 types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the cases where the index is of type datetime64 or timedelta64. We can update the function to check the type of the index and handle the conversions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            i = pd.Timestamp(i) if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) else pd.Timedelta(i)
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks for the type of the index and converts the key to the appropriate type before performing the checks for integer or non-integer indexers.

After making these changes, the `_convert_key` function should handle the datetime64 and timedelta64 cases correctly and resolve the bug.
