The error message indicates that the function `_convert_key` is raising a `ValueError` at line 2128 in `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The error is triggered when trying to access an item with a non-integer index using `.at` and the method expects non-integer indexers. This implies that the isinstance() function fails to recognize that the key is a float value. 

To fix the bug, a suggestion would be to modify the _convert_key method to explicitly check if the key is of type float if the index is non-integer and should be used as a non-integer indexers. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, float) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This updated method will explicitly check if the key is a float when the index is non-integer, and it's being used as non-integer indexers.
