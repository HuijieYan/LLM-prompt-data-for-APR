The bug occurs because the conditional logic within the `_convert_key` method is not handling the comparison of the index type and key type correctly. The function is designed to require keys to be the same type as the index, but it is not handling non-integer keys appropriately.

To fix the bug, we should check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key. If they do not match, we should raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    key_type = type(key)
    
    if index_type != key_type:
        raise ValueError(f"Key type {key_type} does not match index type {index_type}")

    return key
```
