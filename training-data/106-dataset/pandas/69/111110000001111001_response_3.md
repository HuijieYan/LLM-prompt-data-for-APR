Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the conditional checks for whether the index axis is integer or floating, and whether the key matches the index type.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code checks if the index is integer or floating by calling methods on the index object. However, these methods don't exist in the pandas Index class, leading to the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check the type of the index directly using isinstance() and issubclass() functions.
- Use try-except blocks to catch the AttributeError and handle it gracefully.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index) or issubclass(ax.__class__, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
