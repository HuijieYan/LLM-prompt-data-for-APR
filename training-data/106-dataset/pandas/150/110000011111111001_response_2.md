The test function test_array_equivalent_nested is calling the function array_equivalent with two arrays, left and right, and the strict_nan parameter set to True. The first assert checks if array_equivalent returns True and the second assert checks if array_equivalent returns False.

The potential error in the function array_equivalent is located in the section that handles object arrays. When comparing arrays with dtype='object', the code iterates through each element and attempts a direct comparison. The error message indicates that the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous, which suggests that a direct comparison is causing the issue.

The reason behind the bug is that direct comparison of NumPy arrays with dtype='object' is not well-defined and can lead to unexpected behavior due to the presence of nested elements.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for object arrays and avoid direct element-wise comparison. Instead, we should consider using methods like np.array_equal for comparing the arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the function array_equivalent:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if left.dtype == 'object' and right.dtype == 'object':
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return ((left == right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))).all()
```
