The test function `test_array_equivalent_nested()` calls the function `array_equivalent()` with two arrays `left` and `right` and the parameter `strict_nan` set to `True`. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` raised in the function at the line `if left_value != right_value:` which suggests that the comparison between elements of the arrays is returning an array instead of a boolean value.

The bug is occurring because the comparison `left_value != right_value` is performed between two arrays resulting in an array of boolean values instead of a single boolean value. This happens because the comparison is element-wise for arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to consider the whole array, instead of comparing element-wise. We can use the `np.array_equal()` function from NumPy to compare the entire arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return np.array_equal(left.ravel(), right.ravel())

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This corrected function handles object arrays and comparisons between arrays. It uses `np.array_equal()` to compare the entire arrays and return a single boolean result.
