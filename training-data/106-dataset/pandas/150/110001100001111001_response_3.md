The bug in the provided function seems to be occurring due to issues in the comparison of the numpy arrays. The function is designed to check if two arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. It then returns True if the arrays are equivalent. However, it is not handling the comparisons correctly, especially when dealing with NaN values and different shapes of arrays.

From the provided runtime values, the bug is expected to occur in the loop where the comparison of elements is being performed.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be updated to handle the cases where the arrays have different shapes or contain NaN values. Additionally, data type comparisons and views to int64 need to be handled carefully.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Handle NaN and None comparisons
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
