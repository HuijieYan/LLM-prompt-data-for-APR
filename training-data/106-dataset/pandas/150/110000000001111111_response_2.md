The function is designed to compare two numpy arrays, 'left' and 'right', and returns true if the arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. 
Looking at the three buggy cases, the first one should return True because the arrays are equivalent. The second one should return True as well because the arrays are equivalent with a different order of elements. The last case should return False because the arrays are different.

The potential error location is within the if statement that checks if the dtypes of 'left' and 'right' are string dtypes. Specifically, the comparison between elements of 'left' and 'right' arrays inside the for loop seems to be problematic.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of array elements inside the loop for string dtypes. Also, for the third buggy case, the shape of 'left' and 'right' should match for the function to work correctly.

To fix the bug, the comparison inside the for loop for string dtypes needs to be corrected, and a check for the array shape should be added.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if left.dtype.type is np.object_ or right.dtype.type is np.object_:
        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return (left == right).all()

        for i in range(left.shape[0]):
            for j in range(left.shape[1]):
                if left[i, j] != right[i, j]:
                    return False
        return True

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
This corrected code includes a modified comparison for string dtypes and a check for the shape of the arrays before performing any comparisons. With these changes, the function should now work correctly for the provided test cases.
