The given function is designed to compare two numpy arrays and return True if they have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. However, there are several issues in the given code.

The main problem is with the comparison of objects in the numpy array. The code is iterating through the numpy arrays and directly comparing array elements, which is incorrect due to the presence of arrays within the arrays. Additionally, it does not handle the comparison of numpy arrays with different shapes correctly. 

Another issue is that the variable `np` is used, but the NumPy library is not imported in the given code snippet.

To fix the given code:
1. Import NumPy at the beginning of the code.
2. Use a proper method to check the array equivalency with NaN handling, such as `np.array_equal()`.
3. Handle arrays with different shapes by comparing their shapes first.
4. Avoid iterating through individual elements of the numpy arrays as it causes incorrect comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    # Import NumPy at the beginning of the code
    import numpy as np

    if not np.array_equal(left, right):
        return False
    
    # Comparing shapes
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Checking NaN and None equivalency
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left.ravel(), right.ravel())

    return True
```

This modified code checks for array equivalency using `np.array_equal()` and also compares the shapes of the numpy arrays.
