Potential Error Location: 

The potential error location in the provided function "array_equivalent" is in the section where it checks for string dtypes and then tries to compare the values in the arrays. 

Reasons behind the Bug:

The bug occurs because there are incorrect checks for NaN values and non-NaN values in the arrays when the dtype is a string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Use the isnan() function to check for NaN values in the arrays.
2. Use the comparison operator "!=" to check for non-NaN values in the arrays.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    if left.dtype.kind in ('U', 'S') or right.dtype.kind in ('U', 'S'):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            isnan_left = np.isnan(left.astype(float))
            isnan_right = np.isnan(right.astype(float))
            return np.array_equal(isnan_left, isnan_right)
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
In the corrected code:
- We check if the dtype is a string with "U" or "S" kind.
- If it is a string dtype, we use np.isnan() to check for NaN values and then use np.array_equal() to compare the arrays.
- If the dtype is not a string, we simply use np.array_equal() to compare the arrays.
