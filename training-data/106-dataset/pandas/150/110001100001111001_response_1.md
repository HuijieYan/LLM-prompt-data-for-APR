The bug is caused by the comparison logic within the function `array_equivalent`, where it fails when comparing arrays with different values in the specified locations. This mistake leads to an incorrect array equivalence comparison.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to correctly handle the comparison between two arrays with different values at specific locations. We need to compare the arrays element-wise and handle NaN comparisons correctly.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    # string or object arrays comparison
    if (left.dtype == object) or (right.dtype == object):
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    
    # NaNs comparison for float and complex arrays
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.complexfloating):
        return np.array_equal(np.isnan(left), np.isnan(right)) and np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))
    
    # Comparing the rest of the arrays element-wise
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This corrected implementation correctly handles the array equivalence comparison for most standard NumPy array types and should resolve the issues present in the original implementation.
