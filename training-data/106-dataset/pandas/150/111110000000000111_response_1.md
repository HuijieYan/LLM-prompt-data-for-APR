Potential error location: The issue may be caused by the comparison between NaN values in the arrays, as well as the comparison between different data types.

Reason for the bug: The bug might occur due to the incorrect handling of NaN values and the comparison between different data types. The function does not handle these scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the np.isnan() function to check for NaN values in the arrays and compare them appropriately.
2. Ensure that the comparison between different data types is handled appropriately, possibly by converting them to a common data type for comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if not np.array_equal(left.shape, right.shape):
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

        for l, r in zip(left.ravel(), right.ravel()):
            if np.isnan(l) != np.isnan(r):
                return False
            if l != r:
                return False
        return True

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.floating):
        return np.array_equal(left, right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

Please note that the corrected code may need further testing to ensure its correctness.
