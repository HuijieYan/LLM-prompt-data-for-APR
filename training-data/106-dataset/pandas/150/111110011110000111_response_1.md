The test_array_equivalent_nested() function is making use of the array_equivalent() function to check if two arrays are equivalent. It is passing two nested NumPy arrays as arguments to the array_equivalent() function and expecting a boolean value as the output.

The error message "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" is occurring because the comparison between the two nested arrays is ambiguous. Since the arrays are nested, the comparison operator is unable to determine a single boolean value based on the comparison.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the array_equivalent() function to handle comparison of nested arrays properly. Specifically, we need to iterate through the nested arrays and perform element-wise comparison within the nested arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the array_equivalent() function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    if not isinstance(left, np.ndarray) or not isinstance(right, np.ndarray):
        raise ValueError("Input parameters should be NumPy arrays")

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.array_equal(left, right):
        return True

    if isinstance(left[0], np.ndarray):
        for i in range(left.shape[0]):
            if not array_equivalent(left[i], right[i], strict_nan):
                return False
        return True
    else:
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.nan_to_num(left) == np.nan_to_num(right)
```

This corrected code checks if the input parameters are NumPy arrays, compares their shapes, and then iterates through the nested arrays for element-wise comparison. It also accounts for strict NaN comparison by using np.nan_to_num() function.
