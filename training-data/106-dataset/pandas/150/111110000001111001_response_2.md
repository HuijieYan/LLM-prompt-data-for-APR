The potential error in the buggy function is that it doesn't address the scenario of comparing two object arrays with different values. The buggy function does not handle the case when the objects in the arrays are different, and it only checks for NaNs and shapes.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not implementing a comprehensive comparison between the left and right arrays. It focuses on compatibility checks and NaN comparison, but it does not handle the case when the actual values in the arrays are different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to iteratively compare the elements of the left and right arrays and return False if any of the elements are different. We also need to account for the padding with NaNs or missing elements in the arrays.

Below is the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        if left.shape != right.shape:
            return False
        
        for l_row, r_row in zip(left, right):
            for l_val, r_val in zip(l_row, r_row):
                if isinstance(l_val, float) and np.isnan(l_val):
                    if not (isinstance(r_val, float) and np.isnan(r_val)):
                        return False
                elif l_val != r_val:
                    return False
        return True
```

In the corrected code:
- The function iterates through each element of the `left` and `right` arrays and compares them. If any mismatch is found, it returns False.
- If `strict_nan` is `True`, it first checks if the shapes of the arrays are equal, and then compares each element.
- It uses the `np.array_equal` function to check if the arrays are equivalent when `strict_nan` is `False`.
- It handles the comparison of NaN values when `strict_nan` is `True`.
- It ensures that the `left` and `right` arrays are converted to NumPy arrays for comparison.
