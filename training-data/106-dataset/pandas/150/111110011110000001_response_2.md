The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is calling the `array_equivalent` function with two 2D arrays of objects. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the comparison between the elements of these arrays.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between elements of the arrays when the dtype is an object.

The bug occurs because the comparison between the elements of the arrays is attempting to compare the entire arrays, rather than their individual elements. This leads to the ValueError: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous".

To fix the bug, the comparison should be modified to compare individual elements of the arrays rather than the entire arrays.

Below is the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # If the arrays are of type object
    if left.dtype.type is np.object_ or right.dtype.type is np.object_:
        
        # Flatten the arrays for element-wise comparison
        left_flat = left.ravel()
        right_flat = right.ravel()

        # Compare the elements of the flattened arrays
        for i in range(len(left_flat)):
            # If NaNs are not considered strictly
            if not strict_nan:
                if left_flat[i] is None and right_flat[i] is None:
                    # Equivalent if both elements are None
                    continue
                if pd.isna(left_flat[i]) and pd.isna(right_flat[i]):
                    # Equivalent if both elements are NaN
                    continue
                if left_flat[i] != right_flat[i]:
                    # Not equivalent if elements are different
                    return False
            # If NaNs are considered strictly
            else:
                if left_flat[i] != right_flat[i]:
                    # Not equivalent if elements are different
                    return False
        return True

    # For other data types, use np.array_equal for comparison
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
