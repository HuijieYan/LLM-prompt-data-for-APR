The error occurs because the function is trying to compare two arrays directly using the '!=' operator, which leads to the ambiguity error message. This comparison should be handled element-wise instead of using the '!=' operator directly.

To fix the bug, a loop should be added to iterate through the elements of the arrays and compare them element-wise.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Element-wise comparison
    if not (left == right).all():
        return False

    return True
```

This implementation compares the two arrays element-wise and returns True if all elements are equal. If any of the elements are different, it returns False.
