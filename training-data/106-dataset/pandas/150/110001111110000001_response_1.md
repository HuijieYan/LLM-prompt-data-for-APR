The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is calling the `array_equivalent` function with two numpy arrays, `left` and `right`, and the flag `strict_nan=True`. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()".

The potential error location is within the `if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right)` conditional block where the comparison is made between elements of `left` and `right`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison between arrays in the conditional block is causing an ambiguity in the truth value of the array.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison condition to use `np.array_equal` for comparing the entire arrays of `left` and `right` rather than comparing elements in a loop. We will also remove the unnecessary `is_string_dtype` checks. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `array_equivalent`:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))
```
