The error is occurring in the `array_equivalent` function. It seems that the issue lies in the comparison of array elements using the `!=` operator, which leads to a ValueError due to the ambiguous truth value of arrays when using comparison operators.

The reason this bug is occurring is that the comparison of NumPy arrays using the `!=` operator generates another array with boolean values, and when the if statement tries to coerce this boolean array to a single boolean value, it results in the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the comparison of arrays needs to be revised so that the comparison results in a single boolean value. This can be achieved using the `all()` or `any()` methods of NumPy arrays to obtain a single boolean result for comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right):
        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return lib.array_equivalent_object(
                ensure_object(left.ravel()), ensure_object(right.ravel())
            )
        else:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

    # NaNs can occur in float and complex arrays.
    if is_float_dtype(left) or is_complex_dtype(left):
        # empty
        if not (np.prod(left.shape) and np.prod(right.shape)):
            return True
        else:
            return ((left == right) | (isna(left) & isna(right))).all()

    # numpy will will not allow this type of datetimelike vs integer comparison
    elif is_datetimelike_v_numeric(left, right):
        return False

    # M8/m8
    elif needs_i8_conversion(left) and needs_i8_conversion(right):
        if not is_dtype_equal(left.dtype, right.dtype):
            return False
        left = left.view("i8")
        right = right.view("i8")

    # if we have structured dtypes, compare first
    if left.dtype.type is np.void or right.dtype.type is np.void:
        if left.dtype != right.dtype:
            return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
