The buggy function is `array_equivalent`. 
The test cases are used to compare two arrays and check if they are equivalent with respect to NaNs and None values.

Upon analyzing the function and the given test cases, it appears that the function may be facing issues due to incorrect comparison and handling of NaN values in the input arrays. The presence of the `strict_nan` parameter indicates that there might be inconsistent handling of NaN and None values during comparison.

Potential reasons behind the bug:
1. Inconsistent use of `strict_nan` parameter may cause discrepancies in comparisons involving NaN and None values.
2. If NaN and None values are not handled properly, it can lead to erroneous comparisons and unexpected outputs.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that NaN and None values are handled consistently based on the `strict_nan` parameter.
2. Provide proper checks and conditions for comparing NaN and None values in the input arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if not np.array_equal(left.shape, right.shape):
        return False

    if pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(left) or pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(right):
        if not strict_nan:
            return pd.api.types.is_object_array_equal(left.ravel(), right.ravel())
        else:
            return pd.api.types.is_object_array_equal_nan(left.ravel(), right.ravel())
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_string_dtype`, `is_float_dtype`, and other similar checks are replaced with equivalent functions from Pandas library.
- The comparison and handling of NaN values are implemented using the Pandas API for consistency and proper handling.

These changes ensure that the `array_equivalent` function handles NaN values consistently and provides correct comparisons based on the `strict_nan` parameter.
