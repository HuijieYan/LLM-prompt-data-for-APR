The error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` is occurring because the if statement `if left_value != right_value:` is comparing arrays instead of individual elements. The comparison should be element-wise rather than at the array level.

The buggy function is trying to compare two arrays element-wise and aims to account for NaN values correctly. However, it is not handling array-level comparisons and operations correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to perform element-wise comparison properly and consider matching NaNs at each corresponding location while dealing with arrays. Additionally, the code should ensure that proper comparison operations are used for arrays and individual elements. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # comparing objects
    if left.dtype.type is np.object_:
        # if strict_nan is False, consider NaN and None to be equivalent
        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent
            return (pd.isna(left) == pd.isna(right)).all() and (left == right).all()
        else:
            return (left == right).all()

    # comparing float or complex arrays, considering NaNs
    elif np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.complexfloating):
        # empty arrays
        if not (np.prod(left.shape) and np.prod(right.shape)):
            return True
        return ((left == right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))).all()

    # comparing other types of arrays
    else:
        return (left == right).all()
```

In this corrected function, we use the `np.asarray` function to ensure that the inputs `left` and `right` are converted to NumPy arrays. We then compare the arrays appropriately by considering the data type and handling NaN values. This approach ensures that the comparisons are made element-wise and accounts for NaNs correctly.
