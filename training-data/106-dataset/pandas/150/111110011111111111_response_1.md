The error message indicates that the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` is resulting in a ValueError because the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. This happens because the comparison is being performed directly on the arrays `left` and `right` without handling the elements individually.

The potential error location is within the section of the function where it checks for string dtype and then performs the comparison between individual elements of the arrays.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare arrays directly, resulting in an ambiguous truth value when the comparison involves arrays with more than one element. To fix this, the function needs to iterate over each individual element of the arrays and perform the comparison.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # iterate over each individual element and perform the comparison
    for i in range(left.shape[0]):
        for j in range(left.shape[1]):
            if left[i, j] != right[i, j]:
                return False
    return True
```
