Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the comparison logic for NaN values in the `array_equivalent` function. 

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The code does not handle NaN values properly when comparing arrays, leading to incorrect evaluation of array equivalence. 
2. The comparison for NaN values is not correctly implemented, leading to the incorrect behavior of the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `np.isnan()` to check for NaN values in the arrays when comparing them.
2. Revise the logic for comparing NaN values to ensure it accurately evaluates array equivalence. 

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Check for NaN values
    if np.isnan(left).any() or np.isnan(right).any():
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))
        else:
            return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
