Potential error location: The buggy function `array_equivalent` is not implemented correctly, causing it to return incorrect results.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function does not handle the comparison of object arrays properly, leading to incorrect results when comparing arrays with dtype 'object'.
2. The implementation for handling NaN values and None values is not consistent and does not account for all possible cases, resulting in incorrect behavior.
3. The comparison logic for checking the equivalence of arrays is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle comparisons of object arrays separately by identifying and comparing the elements within the arrays directly.
2. Improve the logic for handling NaN and None values, ensuring consistency and correctness in comparisons.
3. Revise the comparison logic for checking the equivalence of arrays, accounting for all possible cases and ensuring correct behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    else:
        if left.shape != right.shape:
            return False

        for i in range(left.shape[0]):
            for j in range(left.shape[1]):
                if (left[i,j] is None and right[i,j] is not None) or (right[i,j] is None and left[i,j] is not None):
                    return False
                elif isinstance(left[i,j], float) and isinstance(right[i,j], float):
                    if not np.isnan(left[i,j]) and not np.isnan(right[i,j]):
                        return False
                elif left[i,j] is not None and right[i,j] is not None:
                    if left[i,j] != right[i,j]:
                        return False
        return True
