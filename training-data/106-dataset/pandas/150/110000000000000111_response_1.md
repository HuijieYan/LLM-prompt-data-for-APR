Potential Error Location: The potential error location in the code is the comparison of left and right arrays for equivalence.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of arrays and handling of NaN values within the arrays.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use NumPy functions such as np.isnan() to handle NaN values within the arrays.
2. Update the comparison logic to correctly handle the equivalence of arrays, including NaN values.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
        
    return ((left == right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))).all()
