The error seems to be occurring in the `array_equivalent` function, specifically in the part where it is comparing arrays of objects. The error message is indicating that the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous, suggesting the use of `a.any()` or `a.all()`.

This error occurs because the comparison between arrays is returning an array of boolean values, and Python is unable to determine a single boolean value from that array. It is not clear whether the expectation was to check if any or all of the boolean values are True.

To fix this bug, the comparison between arrays should be handled explicitly using `any()` or `all()` to generate a single boolean value.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.
    
    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        if not strict_nan:
            return (left == right).all()
        else:
            return (left == right).all()
            
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
