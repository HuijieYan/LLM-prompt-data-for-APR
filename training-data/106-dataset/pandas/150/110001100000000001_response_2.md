The potential error in the given function is that it is not properly handling the comparison of arrays containing NaN values. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing arrays with NaN values.

The code is meant to compare two arrays and return True if they have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs in corresponding locations. However, the code is not handling NaN values properly, which may lead to incorrect results when comparing arrays with NaN values.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle NaN values in the arrays. This can be done by checking for NaN values explicitly and comparing them correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    if np.any(np.isnan(left) != np.isnan(right)):
        return False

    return np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))

```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case when strict_nan is True and simply use np.array_equal to compare arrays when strict_nan is False. We also use np.isnan to check for NaN values and properly compare arrays containing NaN values.
