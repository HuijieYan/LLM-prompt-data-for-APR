The error message indicates that there is a ValueError occurring at line 448 in the 'missing.py' file. This error is due to the ambiguous truth value of an array with more than one element. Specifically, the line `if left_value != right_value` is causing the ValueError when comparing arrays with more than one element.

The reason for this bug is that the function is trying to compare two numpy arrays element-wise directly, which leads to the ambiguity in truth value for arrays with multiple elements.

To fix this bug, we can use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the entire arrays instead of comparing them element-wise. This will ensure that the comparison is unambiguous.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left.ravel(), right.ravel())
```

This corrected code uses the `np.array_equal` function to compare the entire arrays rather than comparing them element-wise, which resolves the ambiguity issue and should fix the bug.
