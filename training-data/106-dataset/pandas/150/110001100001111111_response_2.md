The bug is likely located in the following portion of the code:

```python
if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right):

    if not strict_nan:
        # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
        return lib.array_equivalent_object(
            ensure_object(left.ravel()), ensure_object(right.ravel())
        )
```

The bug occurs because the function `is_string_dtype` is not defined. This is likely to be a custom function, but without its definition, it is not possible to determine the exact error.

To fix the function, the `is_string_dtype` function should be properly defined or imported from a library. This will ensure that the condition is properly evaluated. Additionally, if `is_string_dtype` relies on other functions or classes that have not been imported or defined, those dependencies need to be resolved as well.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
