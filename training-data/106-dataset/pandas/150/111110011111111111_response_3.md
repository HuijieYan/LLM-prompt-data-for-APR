The error message indicates a ValueError: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error is raised from the comparison of 'left_value' and 'right_value' within the 'array_equivalent' function.

The issue is that the comparison 'left_value != right_value' involves arrays, and the comparison of arrays in Python would require either 'any()' or 'all()' to convert the result to a single boolean value.

The logic in the existing function is also convoluted and does not cover all cases properly, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we should streamline the comparison logic and make sure to handle the comparison of arrays properly. 

Here's the corrected code for the 'array_equivalent' function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    Returns True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations. False otherwise. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if not np.array_equal(left.shape, right.shape):
        return False

    # Convert arrays to pandas Series for easier comparison with NaN handling
    left_series = pd.Series(left.ravel())
    right_series = pd.Series(right.ravel())

    if strict_nan:
        # Consider NaN and None to be different
        return left_series.equals(right_series)

    # Consider NaN and None to be equivalent
    return left_series.fillna(method='pad').equals(right_series.fillna(method='pad'))
```

With this corrected function, the comparisons are handled using pandas Series, which provides more robust handling of NaN values. This approach simplifies the implementation and improves the handling of comparisons between arrays.
