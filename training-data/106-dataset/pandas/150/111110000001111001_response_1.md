The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles object arrays.

The first buggy case compares the entire left and right arrays, while the second case extracts and compares individual rows. In both cases, the handling of the object arrays doesn't consider the comparison properly, leading to incorrect results.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison logic for object arrays is not implemented correctly, and it doesn't differentiate between elements when comparing the arrays.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be adjusted to correctly handle object arrays by comparing individual elements and considering the strict_nan parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

        for i in range(left.shape[0]):
            for j in range(left.shape[1]):
                if (left[i, j] is None and right[i, j] is not None) or (isinstance(left[i, j], float) and np.isnan(left[i, j])):
                    if not (isinstance(right[i, j], float) and np.isnan(right[i, j])):
                        return False
                elif left[i, j] != right[i, j]:
                    return False
        return True

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This corrected code ensures that object arrays are correctly compared, taking into account the strict_nan parameter and comparing individual elements within the arrays.
