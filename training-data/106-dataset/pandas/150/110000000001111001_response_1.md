The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic to compare arrays with the same shape and strict_nan=True. The current implementation might not handle the comparison of arrays with the same shape that contain non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Improper comparison logic for arrays with the same shape.
2. The comparison of arrays with missing or NaN values is not handled correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug:
1. Separate the logic for comparing arrays with the same shape and arrays with missing or NaN values. 
2. Handle NaN and non-NaN values separately to ensure proper comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if strict_nan:
        # Consider NaN and None to be different
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    # Handle NaN and non-NaN values separately
    masked_left = np.ma.masked_invalid(left)
    masked_right = np.ma.masked_invalid(right)
    
    return np.ma.allequal(masked_left, masked_right)
```
In the corrected code:
- The shape compatibility check has been retained from the original function.
- If strict_nan is True, it uses np.array_equal to compare the arrays.
- If strict_nan is False, it handles NaN and non-NaN values separately using np.ma.masked_invalid and np.ma.allequal to ensure a proper comparison.
- The corrected code separates the logic for handling strict_nan and non-strict_nan comparisons.
