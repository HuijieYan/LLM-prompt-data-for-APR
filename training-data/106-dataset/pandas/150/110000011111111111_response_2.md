The error is occurring due to the comparison between two NumPy arrays of dtype object using the `!=` operator in the `array_equivalent` function.

The issue arises because the comparison operator `!=` returns an array of boolean values. When an if-condition is directly applied to such array, the truth value is ambiguous due to the presence of multiple elements in the array.

To fix this issue, the comparison between arrays should be handled properly and the comparison result should be reduced to a single boolean value.

Here's the corrected `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if np.array_equal(left, right):
        return True
    
    if strict_nan:
        # If NaN and None should be considered different
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    # All remaining cases where NaN and None should be considered equivalent
    return np.array_equal(
        np.where(left != left, right, left), 
        np.where(right != right, left, right)
    )
```

This corrected function uses the `np.array_equal` function to compare the arrays and handles the strict NaN condition separately. It resolves the issue related to ambiguous truth value in the original code.
