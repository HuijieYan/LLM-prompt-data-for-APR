The issue reported on GitHub involves the incorrect column name being generated when using the `groupby` function with categoricals and aggregation. The test case provided demonstrates this issue, especially when using `agg(pd.DataFrame.sum, skipna=False)`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method of the `Grouping` class. Specifically, the way the column names are handled when using categoricals in the groupby operation might be causing the incorrect column name issue.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling categorical data and column names is not properly implemented in the `__init__` method. When using categoricals, the naming of columns is not correctly handled and results in incorrect column names in the output.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` method should be modified to properly handle column naming when using categoricals in the groupby operation.

Below is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    # ... (other initialization code) ...

    if isinstance(grouper, (Index, Series)) and name is None:
        self.name = getattr(grouper, "name", None)

    # ... (other initialization code) ...

# (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of column names when using categoricals in the `groupby` operation is adjusted to properly extract the column names from the categorical data. This modification should address the issue of incorrect column names in the output when using categoricals in the `groupby` operation.
