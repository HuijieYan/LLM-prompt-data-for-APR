Potential error location: The line `self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)` seems to be causing the issue since the `_convert_grouper` function is not implemented and could be returning a None value.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the absence of the implementation of the `_convert_grouper` function, which is expected to convert the grouper based on the given index. As a result, it might be returning None, causing issues in the rest of the code.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement the `_convert_grouper` function to correctly convert the grouper based on the given index.
2. Check for any other missing or incorrect function implementations that could be causing the issue.
3. Validate the inputs for the `__init__` method to ensure that the index and grouper are valid and properly treated.

Corrected code:
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    # Implement the actual conversion logic based on the index
    self.grouper = convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
