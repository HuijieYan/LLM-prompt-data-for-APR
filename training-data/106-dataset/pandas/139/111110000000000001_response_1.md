The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the initialization of the `Grouping` class. The error seems to occur due to improper handling of different types of `grouper`.

The bug may be occurring because the code is trying to handle multiple types of `grouper` input without proper validation or conversion, leading to unexpected behavior.

One approach to fix the bug is to validate the input `grouper` and convert it to a consistent format before further processing. Proper type checks and conversions should be applied to ensure that the `grouper` is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    if isinstance(self.grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
        self.name = getattr(grouper, 'name', None)

    if self.level is not None:
        if not isinstance(self.level, int):
            if self.level not in self.index.names:
                raise ValueError("Level {} not in index".format(level))
            self.level = self.index.names.index(self.level)

        if self.name is None:
            self.name = self.index.names[self.level]

        self.grouper, self._labels, self._group_index = self.index._get_grouper_for_level(
            self.grouper, self.level
        )
    
    # Rest of the code remains untouched
```

In the corrected code, proper checks and conversions are applied to ensure that the `grouper` is handled consistently and appropriately. Additionally, I've replaced the `AssertionError` with `ValueError` for better exception handling.
