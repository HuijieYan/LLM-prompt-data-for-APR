Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue is likely to be in the handling of the `name` attribute for the `CategoricalIndex`. The error message indicates that the names of the two indexes are different: one is None, and the other is 'A'. This suggests that the `name` attribute is not being set correctly during the creation of the `CategoricalIndex`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `name` attribute is not being handled properly when creating the `CategoricalIndex` within the `__init__` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `name` attribute is properly set when creating the `CategoricalIndex`.
2. Check the logic for setting the `name` attribute during the creation of the `CategoricalIndex` and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior in the test case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected __init__ function
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # Right place for this?
    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and self.name is None:  # Corrected line
        self.name = grouper.name

    if isinstance(grouper, MultiIndex):
        self.grouper = grouper.values

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This correction includes adding `self` to the condition `self.name is None`, and ensures that the `name` attribute is correctly set when creating the `CategoricalIndex`.
