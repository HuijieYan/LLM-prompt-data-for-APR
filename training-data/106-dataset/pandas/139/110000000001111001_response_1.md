The potential error in the code is that the __init__ method is not defined correctly for a class. The parameters of the method are not aligned properly with the class attributes.

The bug occurs because the __init__ method is not correctly defined with the right parameters and their associated default values.

The bug can be fixed by defining the __init__ method correctly with the right parameters and their default values. Additionally, the method should be properly indented as part of a class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(
        self,
        index,
        grouper=None,
        obj=None,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=True,
        observed=False,
        in_axis=False,
    ):

        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
        self.all_grouper = None
        self.index = index
        self.sort = sort
        self.obj = obj
        self.observed = observed
        self.in_axis = in_axis

        # other logic...

```
