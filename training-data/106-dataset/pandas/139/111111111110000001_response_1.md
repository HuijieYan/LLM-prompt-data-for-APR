The test function 'test_preserve_categories' is trying to compare two indexes using the 'tm.assert_index_equal' function, but it fails with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the attribute "names" are different between the left and right indexes.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of the 'name' attribute within the Grouping class. The code within the '__init__' function of the Grouping class initializes the 'name' attribute based on the 'grouper' parameter. However, when comparing the indexes in the test function, the 'name' attribute is not being set correctly, resulting in the AssertionError.

To fix this issue:
1. The 'name' attribute should be handled properly based on the 'grouper' parameter to ensure that it is set correctly.
2. If the 'name' is not provided explicitly, it should be derived from the 'grouper'.
3. In case of a discrepancy, the 'name' attribute should be set or adjusted to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Grouping():
    # ... other code ...

    def __init__(
        self,
        index,
        grouper=None,
        obj=None,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=True,
        observed=False,
        in_axis=False,
    ):
        # ... other code ...

        # Set the name attribute from the grouper if not provided explicitly
        if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
            self.name = grouper.name
        # In case the name is provided explicitly, check and update if necessary
        elif self.name is None:
            self.name = name

        # ... other code ...
```

The corrected code includes handling for the 'name' attribute to ensure that it is set correctly based on the 'grouper' parameter. This change should address the issue with the mismatch in index names and resolve the AssertionError.
