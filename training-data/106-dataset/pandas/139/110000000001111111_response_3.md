The issue seems to be related to the way the column names are handled within the groupby function, especially when dealing with categorical columns and aggregation functions that involve NaN values.

The potential error location within the function could be around the section where the column names are handled, and especially when dealing with categorical columns.

The reason behind the bug could be that the function does not handle categorical column names properly when performing groupby and aggregation operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve checking and updating the logic related to handling categorical column names when performing groupby and aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # Correct column name for categorical
    if isinstance(self.grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None and isinstance(
        self.grouper, Categorical
    ):
        self.name = index.name

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to handle the case when the grouper is of type Categorical, and in such cases, the column name is set based on the index name.
