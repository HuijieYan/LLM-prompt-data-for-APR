The issue here is related to the naming of the columns in the resulting DataFrame after applying a groupby and aggregation operation on a DataFrame containing categorical data.

The bug is likely occurring in the `Grouping` class, specifically in the `__init__` method. The bug is related to the handling of categorical data, resulting in incorrect column names in the output DataFrame.

The reason behind the bug could be related to how the index and grouper are handled when the input data contains categorical values.

To fix this bug:
1. When handling categorical data, ensure that the column names are preserved correctly in the output DataFrame.
2. Check the logic related to retrieving the grouper and index when categorical data is present.
3. Ensure that the correct handling of categorical data preserves the column names during groupby and aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method in the `Grouping` class:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # Handle categorical data
    if isinstance(grouper, Categorical):
        if name is None:
            self.name = obj[grouper.name]
        self.grouper, _ = self.grouper.factorize()
        if self.name is None:
            self.name = grouper.name
        self._labels = self.grouper
        self._group_index = obj[self.name]
    elif isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)):
        self.grouper, _ = grouper.factorize()
```
In the corrected code, the handling of categorical data within the `__init__` method ensures that the column names are preserved correctly in the output DataFrame. The logic for retrieving the grouper and index when categorical data is present has been adjusted to address the bug related to column naming.
