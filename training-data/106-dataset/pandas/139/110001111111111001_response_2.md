The error message is indicating that the "names" attribute of the index is different. This suggests that the bug might be related to how the index is constructed or utilized within the `Grouper` class.

It seems that the bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `Grouper` class. The `name` attribute is set based on certain conditions, and there might be confusion in how `name` is assigned to the `groupby` result index, leading to the difference in the "names" attribute.

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect logic for setting the `name` attribute and its relationship with the index. In particular, if the `name` is not properly set based on the types of the `grouper`, it might lead to discrepancies in index attributes.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `name` attribute is set correctly based on the type of the `grouper` and the index. Additionally, any assumptions about the index or grouper should be carefully checked to avoid inconsistencies in the `Grouper` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Grouper:
    def __init__(
        self,
        index,
        grouper=None,
        obj=None,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=True,
        observed=False,
        in_axis=False,
    ):

        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
        self.all_grouper = None
        self.index = index
        self.sort = sort
        self.obj = obj
        self.observed = observed
        self.in_axis = in_axis

        if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
            self.name = grouper.name

        if level is not None:
            if not isinstance(level, int):
                if level not in index.names:
                    raise AssertionError("Level {} not in index".format(level))
                level = index.names.index(level)

            if self.name is None:
                self.name = index.names[level]

            self.grouper, self._labels, self._group_index = index._get_grouper_for_level(
                self.grouper, level
            )

        # other conditions and assignments as needed ...

```

In the corrected code, additional checks and assignments are added to ensure that the `name` attribute is properly set based on the type of `grouper` and `index`. This should prevent any inconsistencies in the index attributes and resolve the bug.
