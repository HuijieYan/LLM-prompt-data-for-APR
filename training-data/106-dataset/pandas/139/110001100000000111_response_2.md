The bug seems to be occurring in the __init__ method of the provided source code. The bug is likely causing the incorrect column names when using the groupby method with categoricals and aggregating with pd.DataFrame.sum with skipna.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be the mishandling of the categorical columns, leading to incorrect column names.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle categorical columns properly when performing aggregation operations. This involves modifying the code that handles the grouping and aggregation operations for categorical columns.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
        self.name = grouper.name

    if isinstance(grouper, MultiIndex):
        self.grouper = grouper

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

This updated code should handle categorical columns properly and correctly label the resulting columns.
