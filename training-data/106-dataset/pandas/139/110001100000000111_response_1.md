The error location in the provided function is when the data frame column is changed to categorical, the resulting column names are incorrect.

The bug occurs because when the `Name` column is changed to categorical, the groupby operation with `agg` using `pd.DataFrame.sum` with `skipna=False` is resulting in incorrect column names. The expected output is to have the 'Name' column, but it is being labeled as 'index'.

To fix this bug, one approach is to modify the logic within the `__init__` function of the provided code, specifically in the section where the categorical column names are being set.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # right place for this?
    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
        self.name = grouper.name

    if isinstance(grouper, MultiIndex):
        self.grouper = grouper.values

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By modifying this logic, the categorical column names should be correctly labeled in the resulting data frame after the groupby operation with aggregation.
