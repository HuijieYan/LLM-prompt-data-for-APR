Potential error location: The issue appears to be within the `__init__` function of the buggy code. It seems that the function is not handling categorical columns properly when used with the `groupby` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling categoricals during the grouping process, leading to incorrect column names in the output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the code block within the function responsible for handling categoricals.
2. Ensure that the function properly processes categoricals and assigns the correct column names in the output.
3. Adjust the logic to handle categoricals and their associated column names appropriately during the grouping process.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # handle categoricals
    if isinstance(grouper, Categorical):
        self.name = name if name is not None else grouper.name
        # perform the grouping based on the categorical data
        codes, uniques = pd.factorize(grouper, sort=True)
        self._group_index = pd.Index(codes, name=self.name)
        # use the codes and unique values to construct the correct grouper
        self.grouper = codes
        self.all_grouper = uniques
        return

    # rest of the function code
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, a separate conditional block for handling categoricals has been added. This block ensures that categoricals are properly processed and the column names are assigned correctly in the output.
