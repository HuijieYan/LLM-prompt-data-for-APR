The error message indicates that the `fill_value` parameter is being ignored when unstacking a DataFrame with a list of levels. The test case `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` is intended to assert `filled_value=0` in the unstacking process, but it fails due to the issue with the unstacking code.

The potential error in the function is the handling of the `fill_value` parameter when unstacking a DataFrame with multiple levels.

The bug occurs because the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle the `fill_value` parameter correctly when unstacking a DataFrame with multiple levels. This leads to unexpected behavior and the `fill_value` being ignored, ultimately causing the failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fill_value` is properly passed and applied during the unstacking process. This may involve modifying the logic for handling the `fill_value` within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    # Replace the existing unstacked code with the following snippet
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we handle the `fill_value` by passing it directly to the `data.unstack` method, ensuring that it is applied correctly during the unstacking process.
