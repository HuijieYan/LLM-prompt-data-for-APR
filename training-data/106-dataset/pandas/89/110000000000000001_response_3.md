The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that deals with unstacking and re-indexing the data based on the input parameters.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the complexity of the code and the handling of MultiIndex and single Index data structures within the function. It appears that the function is trying to handle both Series and DataFrame inputs, along with different types of indices within the same code block, leading to confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the function by separating the handling of Series and DataFrame inputs, and clearly defining the steps for unstacking and re-indexing the data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data
        for loc in clocs:
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(level=loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the input data is a Series or a DataFrame. If it's a Series, it directly unstacks the data. If it's a DataFrame, it iterates through the specified column locations for unstacking. By simplifying the logic and clearly distinguishing between Series and DataFrame inputs, the bug in the original function is addressed.
