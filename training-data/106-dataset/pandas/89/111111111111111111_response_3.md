The error occurs when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, as the fill_value is ignored. This bug needs to be fixed so that the fill_value is properly applied in this scenario.

The potential error location within the provided function might be in the logic that handles unstacking with multiple levels.

The reason for the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not properly handling the input data and fill_value when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle unstacking with multiple levels and apply the fill_value as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Adjustment for hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the logic remains unchanged
    # ...
```
