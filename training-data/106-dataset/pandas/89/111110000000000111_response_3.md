The problem appears to be with the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is attempting to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. This function doesn't properly handle fill values when unstacking multiple levels.

The error occurs because the fill_value is ignored when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. This is indicated by the incorrect output in the provided test case.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function should properly handle the fill_value parameter when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. This can be achieved by incorporating the fill_value parameter properly when unstacking the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
