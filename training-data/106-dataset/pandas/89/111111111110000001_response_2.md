The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of the values in the data frame for the specific columns. It seems that there is an inconsistency in the values between the expected and the actual result.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the logic for unstacking multi-index data frames, as highlighted in the test case.

The bug most likely occurred due to incorrect handling or reshaping of multi-index data frames during the unstacking process.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for unstacking multi-index data frames is correct and accurate. This may involve verifying the reshaping of the index, columns, and data, ensuring that the fill values are appropriately applied, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data structure.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Unstacking logic for multi-index data frames
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected function, we simplify the unstacking process by directly using the `unstack` method provided by the pandas library for data frames. This should address any potential issues related to unstacking multi-index data frames.
