Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely in the `_unstack_multiple` function, where several operations are performed on the index and data to unstack it. 

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `_unstack_multiple` function is not properly handling the hierarchy of the columns and the index. This is leading to an incorrect unstacking of the data, which is causing the assertion error in the test case.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the hierarchical columns and index are properly handled during the unstacking process.
2. Verify that the reshaping of the data and index is done correctly to match the expected result.
3. Identify any inconsistencies in the unstacking logic and address them accordingly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[::-1], fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```
