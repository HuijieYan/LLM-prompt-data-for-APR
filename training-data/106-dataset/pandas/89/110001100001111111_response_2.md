The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`. It is intended to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels, but it fails to handle hierarchical columns when using the `unstack` method.

The buggy function tries to unstack the DataFrame using an approach that doesn't properly handle hierarchical columns. This results in incorrect output when using nested levels for unstacking.

The key issue seems to be with handling the MultiIndex in the DataFrame columns when attempting to unstack it. The current approach doesn't properly account for this, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the MultiIndex columns. This might involve restructuring the approach to unstacking and identifying the levels correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):
        axis = 1  # Unstack along columns
    elif isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        axis = 0  # Unstack along index

    unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected code simplifies the approach by directly using the `unstack` method on the DataFrame or Series. This allows Pandas to handle the unstacking with proper handling of the MultiIndex columns.
