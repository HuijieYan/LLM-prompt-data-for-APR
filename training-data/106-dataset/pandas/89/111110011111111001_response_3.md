The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the values for the column "('score', 'female', False, 0)" between the expected and the actual result. It seems that the `unstack_multiple` function is not correctly handling the unstacking of the DataFrame.

In the `unstack_multiple` function, the following potential issues are identified:
1. Incorrect manipulation of data and column indices during unstacking process.
2. Possible mishandling of hierarchical column levels.

The bug is occurring due to the mishandling of the unstacking process, where the expected and actual results are not matching for the specific column. It seems that during the unstacking process, some values are NaN (not-a-number) in the resulting DataFrame when they are expected to be 0.

To address this bug, we need to revise the logic for handling the unstacking process and ensure that the NaN values are correctly filled with the specified `fill_value` (which is 0 in this case).

Here's the corrected `unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In this correction, the unstacking process is simplified while also ensuring that the `fill_value` parameter is correctly applied to fill NaN values. This approach addresses the potential issues identified and provides a more straightforward unstacking mechanism.
