Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the conditional statements that handle different data types, such as whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of multi-level unstacking in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The code is not properly unstacking the data when multiple levels are involved, leading to discrepancies in the output values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify the index and columns of the input data to ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly.
2. Handle multi-level unstacking cases separately and ensure that the fill_value parameter is properly incorporated into the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected function for `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Handle unstacking for Series
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:  # Handle unstacking for DataFrame
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function includes explicit handling for unstacking with multiple levels and ensures that the `fill_value` parameter is properly utilized during the unstacking process.
