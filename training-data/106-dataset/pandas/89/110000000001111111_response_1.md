The bug occurs in the function `_unstack_multiple` when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, the `fill_value` is being ignored.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the `fill_value` is being set and used.

The issue arises because the code directly applies the unstack method with fill_value being passed to it, but it doesn't capture the result of the unstack operation and continues to operate on the original DataFrame, which results in the fill_value being ignored.

To fix the bug, the corrected code explicitly captures the result of the unstack operation with the correct fill_value applied.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result
       
         # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, the result variable is used to capture the unstacked DataFrame with the fill_value applied, and then it is returned after the loop. This ensures that the fill_value is correctly applied during the unstack operation.
