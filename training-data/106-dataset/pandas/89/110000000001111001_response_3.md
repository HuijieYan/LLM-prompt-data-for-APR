The bug in the provided function seems to occur due to the incorrect index assignment and unstacking of the DataFrame.

Upon analyzing the problematic function and the given test case, it appears that the bug might be occurring in the section where the data is manipulated and unstacked. The function seems to incorrectly handle the index and unstacking when the input data is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. 

To fix the bug, the function should correctly unstack the data while handling the MultiIndex columns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        dummy = result.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[-1]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[-1]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected function, the unstacking process has been modified to handle the MultiIndex columns properly and the index assignment has been adjusted accordingly.
