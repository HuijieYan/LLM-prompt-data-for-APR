The bug seems to be occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function provided. The error message from the test function indicates that the `fill_value` argument is being ignored when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex.

The possible reason behind the bug is that the logic for unstacking with a list of levels is not correctly handling the `fill_value` argument.

To fix the bug, the logic for unstacking with a list of levels needs to be updated to correctly handle the `fill_value` argument.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (rest of the code)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            # Ensure fill_value is used for unstacking when data.columns is MultiIndex
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        # ... (rest of the code)

    # ... (rest of the code)

    return unstacked
```

The code has been updated to ensure that the `fill_value` argument is used for unstacking when `data.columns` is `MultiIndex`. This should address the issue and handle the `fill_value` correctly in the given test case.
