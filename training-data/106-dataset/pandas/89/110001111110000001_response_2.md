The error message indicates that there is a problem with the unstacking operation in the test case. More specifically, the column values for the ('score', 'female', False, 0) index are different between the expected and actual results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it handles unstacking of the DataFrame. It seems like there might be a discrepancy in the way the unstacking is performed, resulting in the wrong expected output.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to a misunderstanding of how to properly handle multi-level columns during unstacking. This could have led to incorrect index creation and column value assignment, causing the test case to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly and that the resulting DataFrame has the expected column structure.
2. Verify that the correct index and column names are assigned during unstacking to match the expected output.
3. Check for any discrepancies in the unstacking process for multi-level columns that might cause the values to be incorrect.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes
    
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )
    
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
    
    return unstacked
