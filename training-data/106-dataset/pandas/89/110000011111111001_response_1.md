The error occurs when the test function calls the `tm.assert_frame_equal` method to compare the `result` and `expected` DataFrames. The error message indicates that the values in the DataFrame column named "('score', 'female', False, 0)" are different between the `result` and `expected` DataFrames.

The potential error in the provided `buggy` function is likely to be related to the unstacking process, where the value 0 is not replaced with the fill_value parameter. This could be the reason for the differences observed in the comparison.

To address the bug, we need to ensure that the `fill_value` parameter is properly applied during the unstacking process in the `buggy` function. This will ensure consistency with the expected output, and the test function should then pass without errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `buggy` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the `fill_value` parameter is appropriately used during the unstacking operations inside the function, ensuring that the expected result is achieved.
