The bug is likely in the unstack function. The goal of unstacking the data seems to be to reshape it from a long to wide format, presumably based on the specified clocs values.

The error seems to be related to the unstacking process, as the expected output does not match the actual output.

To fix the bug, it may be beneficial to review the unstacking process and check for any misalignments or issues in restructuring the data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def unstack(obj, level, fill_value=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ... (omitting unchanged code for conciseness) ...

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)  # Updated line
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)  # Updated line
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    # ... remainder of the code ...

    return unstacked
```
In the provided fix, the unstack operation has been updated to use the fill_value parameter appropriately. This should address the issue with the unstacked DataFrame not matching the expected output.
