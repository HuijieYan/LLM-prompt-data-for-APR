The error occurs in the block starting from "if rlocs == []:" and ending with "else:". The current code does not properly handle the unstacking of hierarchical columns with fill_value. As a result, the fill_value is ignored when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the unstacking of hierarchical columns with fill_value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame

def _unstack_multiple(data: DataFrame, clocs: list, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            for val in clocs:
                data = data.unstack(level=val, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            return data

    return data
```

With this correction, the fill_value will be properly applied when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex.
