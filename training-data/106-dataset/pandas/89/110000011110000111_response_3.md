It seems that the bug lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function where unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns does not correctly handle the fill_value.

The bug seems to occur in the part of the code where the unstacked DataFrame is processed and the fill_value is not being applied correctly while unstacking with a list of levels.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fill_value is correctly applied when unstacking with a list of levels. This may involve making adjustments to the logic responsible for unstacking and handling the fill_value parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    clocs = [data.columns.get_loc(i) if i in data.columns else -1 for i in clocs]

    if -1 in clocs:
        raise ValueError("All columns to unstack must be present in the DataFrame")

    new_data = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return new_data
```

This updated function takes into account the presence of the columns to unstack and correctly applies the fill_value parameter during the unstacking process. It simplifies the logic to handle the unstacking and fill_value, ensuring that the bug related to ignoring the fill_value is resolved.
