Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the section where the function tries to unstack the data, especially if the data is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns when unstacking the data. This could lead to incorrect restructuring of the DataFrame.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Ensure that the function properly handles MultiIndex columns when unstacking the data, and also consider the possibility of different data types (Series or DataFrame) being passed to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
