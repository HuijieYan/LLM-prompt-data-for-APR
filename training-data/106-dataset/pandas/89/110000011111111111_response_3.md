The error seems to be occurring in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of the `fill_value` parameter when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. The `fill_value` provided in the initial unstack operation is not being considered when unstacking with a list of levels.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fill_value` is passed down to subsequent unstack operations in the code.

The corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    # The following block of code is modified to ensure that the fill_value is passed down to subsequent unstack operations
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By passing the `fill_value` down to subsequent unstack operations, we ensure that the `fill_value` is considered at each step of unstacking, resolving the issue and producing the expected output.
