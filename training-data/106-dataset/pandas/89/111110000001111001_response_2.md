The error occurs when the unstacking operation is performed on the 'data' input that is a DataFrame. The output is expected to be an unstacked DataFrame with new levels and codes for columns.

The bug occurs because the unstacking logic for the DataFrame is not correctly handling the nested columns. This results in incorrect unstacking, leading to issues with the new levels and codes for columns.

To fix the bug, the logic for unstacking the DataFrame needs to be revised to correctly handle the nested columns, new levels, and new codes for columns.

Below is the corrected implementation of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        return data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(clocs)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
        return unstacked
```

This corrected implementation handles the unstacking operation for both Series and DataFrames and properly reorders the levels for the new columns.
