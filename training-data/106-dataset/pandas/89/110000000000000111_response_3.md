The issue is that when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, the fill_value is ignored. The expected output should apply the fill_value to the unstacked levels.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that handle unstacking of the DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the fill_value is not being properly applied during the unstacking of the DataFrame with multiple levels. This leads to the fill_value being ignored and not reflected in the output.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements that handle unstacking of the DataFrame with multiple levels need to be revised to ensure that the fill_value is correctly applied and not ignored.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the function remains the same

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result
          
          # rest of the function remains the same
```
