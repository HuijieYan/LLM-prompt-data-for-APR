The error message indicates that there is an overflow error, specifically "Python int too large to convert to C long". This suggests that the problem arises from attempting to convert a Python int to a C long, but the int is too large to be accommodated in the C long data type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
new_data = data.astype("int64")
```
This line tries to convert the data to int64, but it may encounter an overflow error if the data is too large to be accommodated in the int64 data type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert data to int64 without considering the possibility of overflow.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check for potential overflow before attempting the conversion. If the data is too large to be accommodated in the int64 data type, an alternative approach should be applied to handle such large values, for example, using a different data type or conversion method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (other parts of the class Parser) ...

# this is the fixed function
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            # try converting to int64 first
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly catch the `OverflowError` after attempting to convert the data to int64. If the conversion leads to an overflow, it will be caught, and the conversion will not be successful, preventing the overflow error.
