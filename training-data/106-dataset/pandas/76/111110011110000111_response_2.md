The error message suggests that there is an OverflowError because a Python int is too large to convert to C long. This is likely due to the conversion of a very large number string to an integer type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the type conversion of a very large number string to int64, which results in an OverflowError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to convert a very large number string to an integer type, which is causing an OverflowError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle large number strings differently, for example by converting them to a numeric type with floating point precision.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser:
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        if use_dtypes:
            if not self.dtype:
                return data, False
            elif self.dtype is True:
                pass
            else:
                dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
                if dtype is not None:
                    try:
                        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                        return data.astype(dtype), True
                    except (TypeError, ValueError):
                        return data, False

        if convert_dates:
            new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
            if result:
                return new_data, True

        # Check if data is a string representing a large number
        if isinstance(data, str) and data.isdigit() and len(data) > 15:
            try:
                new_data = np.float64(data)
                return new_data, True
            except ValueError:
                pass

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to see if the data is a string representing a large number. If so, it attempts to convert it to np.float64, which should avoid the OverflowError when dealing with large number strings.
