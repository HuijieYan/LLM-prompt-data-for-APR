The issue seems to be related to the handling of large number strings when parsing JSON data using pandas. The error message indicates an overflow error, which suggests that the code is not handling large numbers properly.

Looking at the `_try_convert_data` function, it seems that the issues may be related to the conversion of data types and specifically handling large number strings.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not handle large number strings properly when converting data types. When encountering large number strings, the code fails to convert them to the appropriate data type, leading to errors.

To fix the issue, the function needs to be updated to handle large number strings correctly. This can be done by checking for the presence of large number strings and converting them to a suitable data type (e.g., float) to avoid overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    if use_dtypes and self.dtype:
        dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
        if dtype is not None:
            try:
                dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                return data.astype(dtype), True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try converting to float
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    if data.dtype.kind == "i" or data.dtype.kind == "u":
        if data.dtype.itemsize < 8:
            # convert integer to float if it's a large number
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

    return data, result
```

In the updated code, we handle large numbers by checking the item size of the integer data type and converting it to float if it's a large number. This should resolve the overflow error when parsing JSON data with large number strings.
