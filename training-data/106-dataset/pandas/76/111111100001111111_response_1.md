The error is occurring in the `_try_convert_data` function when trying to parse a large number string from the JSON data. The function is attempting to convert the large number string to a different data type, which is causing the issue.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not handling large number strings correctly when attempting to convert data types. This results in the function returning incorrect results for certain JSON inputs.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case of large number strings separately, potentially converting them to scientific notation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (previous code)

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # Check for large number strings and convert to scientific notation
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
            if new_data.notnull().all():
                return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # ... (remaining code)

    return data, result
```

This updated code handles the case of large number strings and converts them to scientific notation using the `pd.to_numeric` function. This should fix the issue of parsing large number strings from the JSON data.
