The error message indicates that there is an overflow error when trying to convert a large number string to an integer. This is likely happening in the `_try_convert_data` method where it attempts to convert the data to `int64`.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to convert a large number string to an integer, which results in an overflow error. The method is not handling large number strings correctly when trying to infer the data type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_data` method to handle large number strings by converting them to float instead of integer. This will prevent the overflow error and allow the method to correctly infer the data type.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` method:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected _try_convert_data method
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
        """
        result = False
        new_data = data

        # ... previous code ...

        if convert_dates:
            new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
            if result:
                return new_data, True

        if data.dtype.kind == "i":
            # Convert large number strings to float
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        # ... remaining code ...

        return new_data, result
```

With this correction, the `_try_convert_data` method will convert large number strings to float instead of integer, preventing the overflow error. This should resolve the issue with the overflow error when parsing JSON containing big number strings.
