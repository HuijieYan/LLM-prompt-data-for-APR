The test function `test_frame_int_overflow` is trying to create a DataFrame from a JSON string containing some non-numeric and very large numeric values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `data.astype("int64")` conversion, where it is trying to convert a large string representing an integer to an int64.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that Python's standard integer type is capable of representing very large numbers, while C long type (used in the underlying pandas library written in C) has a limited range. Therefore, trying to convert such a large Python integer to C long causes an OverflowError.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to convert the large integers to strings in the DataFrame rather than attempting to cast them to int64.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    # Convert to string if dtype is object
                    if dtype == "object":
                        return data.astype(str), True
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

By converting large integers to strings, the OverflowError will be avoided, and the function should work correctly without causing runtime issues.
