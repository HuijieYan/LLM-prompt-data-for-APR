The problem with the provided function seems to be the handling of big number strings in the input JSON data. When attempting to convert the data, the function encounters issues with inferring the correct data type for these big number strings, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_data` function to explicitly handle the case of big number strings and convert them to float values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # Corrected function
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
        """
    
        # ... omitted code ...
    
        if convert_dates:
            new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
            if result:
                return new_data, True
    
        # ... omitted code ...
    
        # Handle big number strings
        if data.dtype.kind == "O" and not all(isinstance(item, (float, int)) for item in data):
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
    
        # ... omitted code ...
    
        return data, result
```

In the corrected code, we first attempt to convert the data to dates as before. Then, we handle the case of big number strings by checking the kind of the data dtype. If the kind is "O" (object) and not all items in the data are already of type float or int, we attempt to convert the data to float64. If successful, we set the result to True.

The corrected code addresses the issue with handling big number strings, ensuring that the function can properly handle this scenario and produce the expected output as mentioned in the GitHub issue description.
