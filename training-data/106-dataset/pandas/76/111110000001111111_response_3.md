Issue Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to the conversion of data with large number strings to a dataframe. The problem occurs when trying to parse a JSON with a large number string into a dataframe. It seems that the `_try_convert_data` method is not handling the large number strings correctly, leading to the overflow error.

Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_try_convert_data` method, specifically in the section where it attempts to handle data with dtype 'object' and convert it to float.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the method is not properly handling large number strings when attempting to convert the data to float or integer types. This leads to an overflow error and incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for large number strings and handle them appropriately during the data conversion process.
2. Use the `pd.to_numeric` function to safely convert the data to numeric types, which can handle large number strings without causing an overflow error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
        """
        
        if use_dtypes:
            if not self.dtype:
                return data, False
            elif self.dtype is True:
                pass
            else:
                dtype = (
                    self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
                )
                if dtype is not None:
                    try:
                        dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                        return data.astype(dtype), True
                    except (TypeError, ValueError):
                        return data, False
        
        if convert_dates:
            new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
            if result:
                return new_data, True
        
        result = False
        
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(data):
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass
        
        return data, result
```

The updated code uses the `pd.to_numeric` function to safely convert the data to numeric types, which can handle large number strings without causing an overflow error. This should address the issue with parsing JSON containing large number strings.
