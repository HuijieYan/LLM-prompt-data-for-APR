The bug seems to be related to the function's handling of large number strings when trying to parse them into a dataframe. 

The potential error location within the function is the part that tries to convert the data to float64. It seems like there are issues with large number strings when trying to convert them to float64.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle large number strings appropriately when trying to convert them to float64. As a result, it fails to create the expected dataframe.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle large number strings appropriately when trying to convert them to float64.
2. Check for large number strings specifically and convert them to a more appropriate data type that can handle big numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            # dtype to force
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        if data.str.contains(r'^-?\d+\.\d+$').all():
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
        else:
            try:
                data = data.astype("int64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

    return data, result
```
