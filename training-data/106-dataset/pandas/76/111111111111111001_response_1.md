The test case `test_frame_int_overflow` is trying to parse a JSON with a large integer value into a DataFrame. The function `read_json` is used to parse the JSON, and it internally calls the `_try_convert_types` method. Within this method, the `_try_convert_data` method is called, which is responsible for attempting to parse an ndarray-like data into a column by inferring the dtype.

The error occurs when trying to cast the large integer value to "int64". The OverflowError is raised because the value is too large to be converted to a C long.

The issue is that the `_try_convert_data` method does not handle large integer values appropriately. To fix the bug, we need to modify the data parsing and casting logic to account for large integers.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check for the datatype of the input data before casting. If the data type is an integer and its value is too large to be represented as C long, then it should be handled as a string or a different data type to avoid the OverflowError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` method:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = (self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype)
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if np.issubdtype(data.dtype, np.integer) and (abs(data) > np.iinfo(np.int64).max).any():
        return data.astype(str), True  # Handle large integers as strings

    if data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("float64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # Similarly handle other cases for different data types

    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, we check if the data type is an integer and its absolute value exceeds the maximum allowed value for np.int64. If so, we cast the data to a string to avoid the OverflowError. This approach handles the issue of large integer values causing OverflowError and should fix the bug.
