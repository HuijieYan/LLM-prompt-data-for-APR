The error message indicates that an OverflowError occurred when trying to convert a Python int that is too large to a C long. This error is likely related to the coercion of floats to 64-bit integers.

The issue is likely in the `_try_convert_data` function where there is an attempt to coerce data to different types such as int64, float64, etc.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is incorrectly attempting to coerce large integers to 64-bit integers, which causes an OverflowError.

To fix this bug, we should revise the logic that coerces the data to different types and handle large integers separately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False
    
    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True
    
    result = False
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the coercion of data to different types based on specific conditions and instead directly attempted to coerce data to "int64" in all cases for objects. This ensures that large integers are handled properly without causing OverflowError.
