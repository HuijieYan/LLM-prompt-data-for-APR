The error occurs when trying to convert a string representing a large number to an integer. The error message "OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long" indicates that the number is too large to be converted to an integer in Python.

The issue lies in the `_try_convert_data` function, specifically when trying to coerce the data to an integer using `data.astype("int64")`. This causes an overflow error when the string represents a very large number.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_try_convert_data` function to check if the data is of type `object` and if so, we should attempt to convert it to a float instead of directly to an integer. If that fails, we can keep the data as is.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    if len(data) and (data.dtype == "object"):
        # Try to convert to float
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("float64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    # ... omitted code ...

    return data, result
```

By making these changes, we handle the conversion of large number strings by first trying to convert them to floats and then falling back to keeping them as strings if the conversion fails.

This approach should resolve the OverflowError issue encountered with large number strings in the test case.
