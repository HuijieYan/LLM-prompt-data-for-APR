Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `_try_convert_data` method of the `Parser` class. In particular, the issue seems to be related to converting large number strings to the correct dtype.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the data type conversion of large numbers in the JSON. When attempting to parse a large number string, the method is not handling it properly, causing an overflow error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a robust method to handle the conversion of large numbers in the JSON to avoid overflow errors.
2. Check the dtype of the data and handle large numbers separately to prevent overflow issues.
3. Use exception handling to catch and handle overflow errors during the data type conversion process.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (omitted code)

    if convert_dates:
        if data.dtype == "object" and data.str.match(r'^[0-9]*$').all():
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
                if new_data.notnull().all():
                    return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            return data, False

    return data, result
```
This corrected method includes a check for large number strings in the `data` before conversion. It uses `pd.to_numeric()` to handle the conversion of large numbers, and catches and handles any overflow errors. This should address the overflow issue when parsing large number strings from the JSON.
