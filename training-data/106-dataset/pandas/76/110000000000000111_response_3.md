The issue seems to be related to the conversion of the big numbers in the JSON file to the appropriate data type when reading it into a dataframe using the `pd.read_json` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_try_convert_data` function because it is responsible for inferring the data types and coercing the data into the correct data types.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling large numbers appropriately and is failing to convert them to the desired data type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle large numbers and convert them to the appropriate data type. We can modify the data type handling logic to handle large numbers more accurately and convert them to the correct data type.

The corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # some part of the original code is omitted for brevity

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    if data.dtype == "object" and dtype.kind in ['i', 'u']:  # handling large numbers
                        converted_data = np.array([int(x) if len(x) < 16 else x for x in data], dtype=dtype)
                        return converted_data, True
                    else:
                        return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    # the rest of the original code remains unchanged

```
