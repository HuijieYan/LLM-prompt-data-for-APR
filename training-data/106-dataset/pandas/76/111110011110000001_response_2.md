The provided test case is trying to parse a JSON string into a DataFrame using the `read_json` function. It includes a column with an extremely large integer value ("31900441201190696999") and a column with string values. The error message indicates that there is an overflow error when trying to convert the string representation of the large integer into an integer type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the function attempts to coerce the input data to integer types.

The bug occurs because the function `_try_convert_data` attempts to convert data to `int64` using the `astype` method without checking for the potential overflow of large integer values. This causes an overflow error when a string representation of a large integer is encountered.

To fix the bug, the function should validate the input data (which is in string format) before converting it to integer types. Additionally, the function should handle the overflow issue by catching the `OverflowError` and returning the original data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... previous code ...

    if len(data) and (data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object"):
        # Check if the data can be safely converted to integer
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            if (new_data == data).all():
                data = new_data
                result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if data.dtype == "int":
        # Attempt to coerce ints to 64, handling overflow error
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the input data can be safely converted to an integer type using a `try-except` block. If the conversion fails due to `OverflowError` or other errors, it catches the exception and returns the original data. This approach ensures that large integer values represented as strings are handled properly without causing an overflow error.
