The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the attempt to convert large number strings to integer or float data types. The function seems to be trying to convert the data to different types based on certain conditions, but the conversion process is not handling large number strings properly.

To fix this bug, you should consider using a different approach for handling large number strings, such as converting them to scientific notation. Additionally, the function should handle the data types more robustly to ensure that the conversion process is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    result = False

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            # dtype to force
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    if data.dtype == object and data.str.isnumeric().all():
        try:
            new_data = data.astype(np.float64)
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            return data, False

    return data, result
```
