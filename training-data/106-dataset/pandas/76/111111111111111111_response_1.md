The error message indicates an overflow error when trying to convert a large number string to an integer. This error is likely related to the `_try_convert_data` function, which attempts to convert data to different types, including integers.

The bug occurs because the function tries to convert large number strings to integers. Since the numbers are larger than the maximum value for integers, it causes an overflow error.

To fix the bug, the function should handle large number strings separately and consider converting them to floating-point numbers instead of integers. This will prevent overflow errors and allow the function to handle large number strings correctly.

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (omitted code)

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":

        if any(data.str.contains('e')):
            # try converting to float if string contains scientific notation
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
        else:
            # try converting to float without scientific notation
            try:
                float_data = data.astype(float, errors='ignore')
                if (float_data == data).all():
                    data = float_data
                    result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the function will be able to handle large number strings correctly by converting them to floating-point numbers instead of integers, preventing overflow errors.
