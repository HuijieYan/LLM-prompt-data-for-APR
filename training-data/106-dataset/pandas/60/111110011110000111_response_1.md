The error message indicates that the `assert_series_equal` function is failing because the expected and actual results are not matching. This implies that the `apply` function within the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class is not processing the data correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The potential error in the `apply` function is the way it handles the `raw` argument. The condition `if not is_bool(raw):` is not sufficient to validate the correctness of the `raw` argument, and it may be incorrectly raising a `ValueError`. Additionally, the condition `if engine == "numba":` that checks for the engine type is not implemented correctly.

The reason for the bug is that the `apply` function is not properly handling the `raw` parameter and the engine type.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the validation of the `raw` parameter and also correct the conditions based on the engine type.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function within the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class:

```python
def apply(
    self,
    func,
    raw: bool = False,
    engine: str = "cython",
    engine_kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
    args: Optional[Tuple] = None,
    kwargs: Optional[Dict] = None,
):
    if args is None:
        args = ()
    if kwargs is None:
        kwargs = {}
    kwargs.pop("_level", None)
    kwargs.pop("floor", None)
    window = self._get_window()
    offset = calculate_center_offset(window) if self.center else 0

    if isinstance(raw, bool) and engine in ["numba", "cython"]:
        if engine_kwargs and engine == "cython":
            raise ValueError("cython engine does not accept engine_kwargs")
        apply_func = self._generate_cython_apply_func(
            args, kwargs, raw, offset, func
        ) if engine == "cython" else generate_numba_apply_func(
            args, kwargs, func, engine_kwargs
        )
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid combination of raw and engine type")

    return self._apply(
        apply_func,
        center=False,
        floor=0,
        name=func,
        use_numba_cache=engine == "numba",
    )
```

In the corrected code, we have used `isinstance()` to check if the `raw` variable is of the `bool` type. We also revised the condition for engine type and removed redundant conditions, ensuring that the appropriate `apply_func` is assigned based on the engine type and `raw` value. Additionally, a more descriptive error is raised when an invalid combination of `raw` and engine type is provided.
