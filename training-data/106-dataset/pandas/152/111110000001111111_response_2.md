The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it determines whether `to_append` is a list/tuple or a single Series. The error message from the GitHub issue also suggests that there is an issue with concatenating a tuple of Series. 

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `to_append` is a tuple of Series. This results in a TypeError when the function attempts to concatenate a list with a tuple.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check whether `to_append` is a tuple and handle it accordingly. It should also consider checking the type of elements inside the tuple to avoid errors related to combining different types (e.g., combining lists and tuples).

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
