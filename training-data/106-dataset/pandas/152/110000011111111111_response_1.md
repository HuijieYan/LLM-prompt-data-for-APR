The error occurs because the `append` method is attempting to concatenate a list with a tuple. This is because the `to_append` parameter is defined as either a Series or a list/tuple of Series, but the implementation only handles a list, resulting in a `TypeError` when a tuple is passed.

To fix this bug, the `append` method needs to have a condition to handle both a list and a tuple of Series. This can be achieved by checking if the type of `to_append` is a tuple, and if so, converting it to a list before concatenating.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this change, the `append` method will correctly handle both list and tuple inputs, and the issue of raising a `TypeError` when a tuple is passed will be resolved.
