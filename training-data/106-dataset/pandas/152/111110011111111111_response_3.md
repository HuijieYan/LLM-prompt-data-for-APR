The error occurs in the `append` method of the `Series` class. The error indicates that the method is trying to concatenate a list and a tuple, which is not supported.

The potential error location is the line where the `to_concat` variable is defined using the `+` operator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is expecting the `to_append` parameter to be either a Series or a list/tuple of Series, but when it receives a tuple of Series, it is trying to concatenate it as a list, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the method needs to handle the case where `to_append` is a tuple separately from the case where it is a list. It can convert the tuple to a list before concatenating it.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```
