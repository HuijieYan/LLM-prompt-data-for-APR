The error is occurring in the `append` method when the input `to_append` is a tuple of Series. The error message indicates that the code is attempting to concatenate a list and a tuple, which is not allowed.

This is happening because the code block inside the `append` method is trying to concatenate `self` and `to_append` using the `+` operator, but it only works for lists and not tuples.

To fix the bug, the code should check whether `to_append` is a tuple and convert it into a list before concatenating it with `self`. This will ensure that the concatenation operation works as expected for both lists and tuples.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
