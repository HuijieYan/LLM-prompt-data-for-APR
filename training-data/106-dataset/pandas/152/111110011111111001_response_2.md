The error occurs in the `append` method of the `Series` class. This method is supposed to have the ability to accept both lists and tuples of Series to concatenate. However, the current implementation only accepts a list or a tuple of Series, but not a tuple of Series.

To fix this, the `isinstance` check in the `append` method needs to be modified to handle tuple inputs as well. Additionally, the `to_concat` assignment needs to account for both list and tuple inputs, ensuring that it concatenates correctly regardless of the input type.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
