The error is occurring in the `append` method when it is trying to concatenate `to_append` to the `self` Series while `to_append` is a tuple. The bug is happening because the method assumes that `to_append` is either a list or tuple of Series, but it does not handle the case when `to_append` itself is a tuple. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `to_append` is a tuple and convert it to a list before concatenating it with `self`. After concatenating, we can use the `concat` function to combine the Series.

The corrected code for the `append` method is as follows:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert to_append to list if it's a tuple
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
