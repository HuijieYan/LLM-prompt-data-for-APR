The error occurs in the `append` method of the Series class in the pandas library. The error is caused by the fact that the method tries to concatenate a list and a tuple using the `+` operator, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix this issue, the `append` method should convert the tuple to a list before concatenating it with the existing list. This can be done using the `list()` function in Python.

To resolve the bug, the corrected `append` method for the Series class is provided below:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this correction, the `append` method should now be able to accept both lists and tuples of Series without raising the TypeError.
