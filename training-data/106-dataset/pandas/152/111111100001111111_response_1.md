The error message indicates a TypeError when trying to concatenate a tuple of Series to a list.

The error is occurring in the `append` method, specifically in the line:
```
to_concat = [self] + to_append
```
This is because the `to_append` parameter can be a list or a tuple of Series, and the code is trying to concatenate a list (`[self]`) with a tuple (`to_append`).

The bug occurs because the code is not handling both the list and tuple cases for `to_append` parameter.

To fix this issue, the `to_append` parameter needs to be handled differently based on its type. If it is a list, it can be directly concatenated with `[self]`. If it is a tuple, it should be converted to a list and then concatenated with `[self]`.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method with the fix:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
