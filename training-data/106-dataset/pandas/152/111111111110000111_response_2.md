The error is occurring at line 2733 in the `append` function in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to concatenate a list and a tuple.

The function is expecting the `to_append` parameter to be a Series or a list/tuple of Series. However, when a tuple of Series is passed to the function, it raises a TypeError.

The bug occurs because the function is not designed to handle a tuple of Series correctly. It attempts to concatenate the tuple with a list which results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function should explicitly handle the case when `to_append` is a tuple. It should convert the tuple to a list before concatenating it with the existing list.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_append = list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this correction, the `append` function will be able to handle both lists and tuples of Series properly, resolving the TypeError that was occurring before.
