The error is occurring in the `append` method of the `Series` class. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is raised on line 2733 when trying to concatenate a list and a tuple.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the case where `to_append` is a tuple properly. The code assumes that `to_append` will be a list of Series, but when it's a tuple, the code fails to concatenate it with the existing list.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `to_append` is a tuple separately. We can convert the tuple to a list and then concatenate it with the existing list.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this correction, the `append` method should be able to handle both lists and tuples of Series correctly.
