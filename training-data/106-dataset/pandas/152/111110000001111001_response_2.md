The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the input parameter `to_append` when it is a list of Series. When `to_append` is a list, the function attempts to concatenate `self` with each element of the list, resulting in `self` being included twice in the final concatenated list. This causes duplication of data, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this issue, the function should check if `to_append` is a list of Series and modify the concatenation process accordingly. The correct approach is to directly concatenate `self` with the elements of the list, without including `self` multiple times.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Corrected method for concatenating two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
