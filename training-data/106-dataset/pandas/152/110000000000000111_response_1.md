The error message suggests that there is a TypeError occurring during concatenation of a list and a tuple, specifically in the line `to_concat = [self] + to_append`.

The bug is occurring because the function checks if `to_append` is a list or tuple and tries to concatenate `to_append` to a list using the `+` operator. However, it does not account for the fact that `to_append` could be a tuple, which causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle both lists and tuples correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]

    return pd.concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert `to_append` into a list using the `list()` function if it's a tuple. This ensures that both lists and tuples can be concatenated safely. We also replaced the import of `concat` from `pandas.core.reshape.concat` with `pd.concat` to ensure compatibility with how `concat` should be imported.
