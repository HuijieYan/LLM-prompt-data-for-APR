The error message "TypeError: can only concatenate list (not 'tuple') to list" indicates that the function is unable to concatenate a tuple of Series to a list. This suggests that the problem lies in the code that deals with the input being a tuple.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when the input 'to_append' is a tuple. The function attempts to concatenate the tuple directly with a list, which causes the TypeError. To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case when 'to_append' is a tuple and convert it to a list before concatenating.

Here's the corrected code for the 'append' method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert to_append to a list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
``` 

In this corrected code, the to_append is converted to a list when it's a tuple, ensuring that the concatenation operation can be performed without raising a TypeError.
