The given function is using an inappropriate procedure for concatenating Series. It is forcibly concatenating the input with `self`, but the input can be both a list or a tuple of Series. This is leading to a TypeError in the test case because the function is unable to handle a tuple as the input.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `append` method to handle both list and tuple inputs correctly. The correct approach would be to first check if `to_append` is a list or tuple, then process accordingly. If it is a list or tuple, then we should use the elements from it, otherwise, we should use `to_append` directly for concatenation.

Below is the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """

    from pandas import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]

    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle both list and tuple inputs for concatenation and will not lead to a TypeError.
