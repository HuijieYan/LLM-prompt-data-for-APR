The error occurs because the `to_append` variable is checked for being a list or tuple to decide on the subsequent operation, but then both are concatenated to another list unconditionally, which may lead to a type error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to differentiate between a list and a tuple. If it's a tuple, we convert it to a list and then concatenate it. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
