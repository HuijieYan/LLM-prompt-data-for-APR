The test case `test_append_tuples` is appending a tuple of Series to another Series, which is causing an error.

The potential error location within the `append` method is at the line:
```python
to_concat = [self] + to_append
```
This line is concatenating `self` (which is a Series) with `to_append`, which can be a tuple of Series, causing the TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to concatenate a list with a tuple, which is not supported in Python.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `append` method to handle the case when `to_append` is a tuple. We can convert the tuple to a list and then concatenate it with `[self]`.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    # Rest of the docstring...

    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to a list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this correction, the `append` method can now handle the appending of a tuple of Series, resolving the TypeError.
