The issue with the `append` function is that the input parameter `to_append` can either be a Series or a list/tuple of Series, but the current implementation does not handle a tuple of Series correctly.

The function is currently using an if-else block to determine if `to_append` is a list/tuple or just a Series. If it's not a list/tuple, it wraps `to_append` in a list. However, the correct approach in the case of a tuple of Series is to directly use it as `to_concat`, just like when `to_append` is a list.

To fix this, we need to modify the if-else block to handle both cases correctly.

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list if to_append is a tuple
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

This modification ensures that when `to_append` is a tuple, it is converted to a list and then concatenated with `self` to form the `to_concat` list, which is then used for concatenation.
