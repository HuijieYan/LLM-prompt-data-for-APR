The error occurs in the `append` method when it tries to concatenate a list with a tuple. This is because the `to_append` parameter is allowed to be either a Series or a list/tuple of Series, but the bug arises when the method tries to concatenate a tuple of Series.

The `to_append` parameter is actually of type `Union[List[Any], Tuple[Any, ...]]`, so it can be a list or a tuple. In the case of the buggy function, when `to_append` is a tuple, the method tries to concatenate a list with a tuple using the `+` operator, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `to_append` is a tuple separately from when it's a list. Instead of directly concatenating `[self]` with `to_append`, we should check the type of `to_append` and then handle the concatenation accordingly.

The corrected code for the `append` method is as follows:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `to_append` is of type `list` or `tuple`. If it's a tuple, we convert it to a list before concatenating with `[self]`. This ensures that the method can handle both list and tuple inputs for `to_append` without raising a `TypeError`.
