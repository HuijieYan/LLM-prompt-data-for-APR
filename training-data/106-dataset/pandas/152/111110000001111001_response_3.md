Potential error location: The bug is likely to be in the `append` method because it is expected to concatenate two or more Series together, but it seems to be returning the wrong result.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function `to_append` should be concatenated with the `self` Series, but it is not being concatenated correctly due to the way it is being used within the `append` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the `to_append` Series is being concatenated correctly with the `self` Series.
- Verify the indexing behavior to ensure that it aligns correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    """
    
    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list if necessary
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    
    result = pd.concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
    return result
```
