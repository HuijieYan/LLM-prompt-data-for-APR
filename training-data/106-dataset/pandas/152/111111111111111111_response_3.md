The error occurs in the `append` method of the `Series` class because the method is not handling a tuple of Series correctly. The method should concatenate the tuple elements with the existing list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is expecting to receive a list of Series or a tuple of Series, but it only handles the list. When a tuple is passed, it causes a TypeError because the method attempts to concatenate the tuple directly to the list.

To fix the bug, the method should check if the input `to_append` is a tuple, and if so, convert it to a list before concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.

    Notes
    -----
    Iteratively appending to a Series can be more computationally intensive
    than a single concatenate. A better solution is to append values to a
    list and then concatenate the list with the original Series all at
    once.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this corrected method, the test case `test_append_tuples` should pass without raising a TypeError.
