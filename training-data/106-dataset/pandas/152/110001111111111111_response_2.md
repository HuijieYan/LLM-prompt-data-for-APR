The error occurs in the `append` method where the program is attempting to concatenate a list and a tuple. The `to_append` variable can be a Series, list, or tuple of Series. In both Case 1 and Case 2, the `to_append` variable is provided as a list and a tuple, respectively, containing two Series.

The error message points to the line `to_concat = [self] + to_append` as the location causing the issue. The error message indicates that it's trying to concatenate a list and a tuple, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix this issue, the program should check the type of `to_append` and if it's a list or tuple, it should be able to concatenate correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series, list or tuple of Series
        Series to append with self or list/tuple of Series.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

Note that I've modified the `to_append` parameter description to include Series, list, or tuple of Series, and explicitly converted the input `to_append` to a list using `list(to_append)` to make sure it's a list regardless of whether the input is a list or a tuple. This change allows the concatenation of `self` and `to_append` to be valid.
