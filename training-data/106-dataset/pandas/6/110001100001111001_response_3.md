Potential Error Location:
The bug occurs when the function is trying to extract the level values from the group_axis. It then checks whether the level is a list or if it's a scalar, performs certain operations accordingly. This part of the code has potential issues.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The function does not handle the extraction of level values from the group_axis properly. It also does not adequately handle the scenario where the level is a list-like object. This can lead to incorrect processing of levels and cause unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function properly handles whether the level is a list-like object or a scalar.
2. Add conditional checks to handle the extraction of level values from group_axis based on different scenarios.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if np.isscalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        elif pd.api.types.is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
This fixed function handles the extraction of level values from group_axis correctly and includes necessary checks to handle different scenarios.
