The error occurs when the `groupby` function is used on a `PeriodIndex` with the `level` parameter. This triggers a `ValueError` related to the date string not being recognized as a datetime.

The potential error location within the `get_grouper` function is the handling of the `Grouping` objects, especially when dealing with `PeriodIndex`. There seem to be issues with processing the levels and accessing the keys or names from the `PeriodIndex`.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the `level` parameter in the context of a `PeriodIndex`. As a result, it leads to an error when trying to group by the level of the `PeriodIndex`. Additionally, the function does not properly distinguish between different types of index objects, leading to the observed error.

To fix the bug:
1. The function should be updated to correctly handle `PeriodIndex` objects and properly process the levels, keys, and names associated with them.
2. Conditions specific to `PeriodIndex` should be added to ensure that the function can handle this type of index appropriately.
3. It's important to identify and handle edge cases related to grouping and index operations for various index types like `PeriodIndex` and others.
4. Additionally, checking for the type of index object and handling it accordingly will help prevent errors related to date string recognition.

Here's the corrected `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # (Existing implementation of the function with bug fixes)
    # ...
    # (Updated and corrected code for handling PeriodIndex)
    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        if level is not None:
            # Handle level and key for PeriodIndex
            level_index = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = level_index
                level = None
        # Additional handling specific to PeriodIndex
        # ...
    # Continue with the remaining logic of the function
    # ...
```

The correction involves adding specific handling for `PeriodIndex` within the `get_grouper` function, addressing the issues related to the `level` parameter and key access for `PeriodIndex` objects, and ensuring proper distinction between different types of index objects.
