The bug is observed when trying to group a Series using a `PeriodIndex` as the level in the `groupby` method. The error message "Given date string not likely a datetime" suggests that there might be an issue with handling the date string when using a `PeriodIndex` as the level.

The potential error location within the `get_grouper` function is likely in the logic for handling the `PeriodIndex` as a level for grouping.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle `PeriodIndex` objects when used as the level for grouping. When processing a `PeriodIndex` as the level, there might be issues with the date string representation and date operations, resulting in the "Given date string not likely a datetime" error.

To fix the bug, the function should include specific logic to handle `PeriodIndex` objects when used as the level for grouping. This logic should ensure proper handling of the date string representation and date operations for `PeriodIndex` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... existing code ...

    # Handling PeriodIndex level for grouping
    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        level_index = group_axis.levels[0]
        if level_index.name != level:
            raise ValueError(
                f"level name {level} is not the name of the {group_axis.name}"
            )
    
    # ... existing code ...
```

In the corrected code, I added specific handling for `PeriodIndex` objects when used as the level for grouping. The logic ensures that the level name is correctly matched with the `PeriodIndex` name.

This should help mitigate the issue with the date string representation and date operations when using a `PeriodIndex` as the level for grouping, and resolve the "Given date string not likely a datetime" error.
