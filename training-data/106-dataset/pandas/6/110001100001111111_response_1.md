The error occurs when trying to group by a level in a PeriodIndex. The error message "ValueError: Given date string not likely a datetime" suggests that the code is expecting a datetime but is receiving a different type.

The issue in the code lies in the `is_in_axis` function and the conditions that follow it. The function `is_in_axis` is checking for label-like values, but it is assuming that the input is a datetime-like value, which may not be the case for a PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle PeriodIndex values differently from datetimes. The conditions that check for datetimes should be adjusted to handle PeriodIndex values as well.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """

    # existing code...

    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # existing code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check for `isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex)` to handle the case where the index is a PeriodIndex. This ensures that the code behaves correctly for PeriodIndex values when creating the grouper.
