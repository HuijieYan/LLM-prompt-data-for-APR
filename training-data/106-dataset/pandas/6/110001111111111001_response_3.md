Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the problem occurs when the `get_grouper` function is trying to determine the level of the group. The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the date string, which might be due to the level parameter being incorrectly handled within the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it handles the `level` parameter and tries to extract the corresponding key from the group axis. It applies some checks and conversions to handle the level, which may be causing issues in parsing the date string.

The bug occurs because the 'level' parameter is not being properly handled and converted into the appropriate key from the group axis. This leads to an error when trying to parse a date string within the 'level'.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to review and revise the part of the function that deals with handling the 'level' parameter and extracting the corresponding key from the group axis. This might involve checking the type of the level parameter and handling it accordingly to ensure that it can be correctly used to extract the key.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Handle MultiIndex case
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # Handling for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if group_axis.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name "
                        f"of the {group_axis.name}"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            # Check and convert level to key if it matches
            key = group_axis

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we have made adjustments to handle the 'level' parameter more precisely based on the data type and the type of group axis involved. This should resolve the parsing error in the test case.
