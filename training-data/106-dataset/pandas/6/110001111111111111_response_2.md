The error is caused when trying to group by a PeriodIndex level in the `get_grouper` function. The error is due to the group axis being a PeriodIndex and not being handled properly in the function.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling PeriodIndex as the group axis properly. This leads to a ValueError when trying to get the location of the key in the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function `get_grouper` needs to be updated to handle PeriodIndex and its associated operations properly. This includes checking if the group axis is a PeriodIndex and adjusting the operations accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Check if the group axis is a PeriodIndex
    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        if level is not None:
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.to_timestamp()
                if isinstance(level, str):
                    if obj._get_axis(axis).name != level:
                        raise ValueError(
                            f"level name {level} is not the name "
                            f"of the {obj._get_axis_name(axis)}"
                        )
            else:
                raise ValueError("Only one level should be specified for a PeriodIndex")

    # ... (remaining code)
```

This correction checks for the `PeriodIndex` type and then appropriately handles the keys and levels based on this information.

By ensuring that the function can handle `PeriodIndex` group axes, the ValueError caused by improper handling of the PeriodIndex should be resolved.
