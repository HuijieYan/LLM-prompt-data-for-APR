Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `get_grouper` method, specifically in the section where it checks if the key is in the object.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug appears to be caused by incorrect handling of the PeriodIndex when grouping by level "A". The error message suggests that the given date string is not likely a datetime, which indicates a problem with the handling of the PeriodIndex level.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The function needs to be modified to correctly handle the PeriodIndex when grouping by level "A". This might involve adjusting the logic for checking if the key is in the object and ensuring that the date string is properly recognized as a datetime.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Hashable, Tuple

def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if isinstance(level, PeriodIndex):
        level = level.name

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, [key.key], obj

    # ... (existing code) ...

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = ops.BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
This corrected code includes a specific check for when the level is a PeriodIndex, ensuring that the level is recognized correctly. It also retains the existing logic for processing groupings and exclusions.
