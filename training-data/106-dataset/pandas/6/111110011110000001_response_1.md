The error occurs in the `is_in_obj` function within the `get_grouper` method. This function is used to check if a group key is present in the object. The error message suggests that it might be related to a datetime parsing issue, which is likely due to the comparison of the group key with the name attribute of the object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_in_obj` function to handle the comparison correctly and make sure it does not lead to the datetime parsing error.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_in_obj` function and the `get_grouper` method:

```python
def is_in_obj(gpr, obj) -> bool:
    if not hasattr(gpr, "name") or not isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
        return False
    return gpr.name in obj.columns or gpr.name in obj.index.names


def get_grouper(
    obj: DataFrame,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], DataFrame]":
    # (previous code remains the same...)

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if is_in_obj(gpr, obj):  
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)
        # (remaining code remains the same)

    # (remaining code remains the same)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, the `is_in_obj` function is updated to take both the group key and the object as input arguments. Additionally, the `get_grouper` method now receives a DataFrame as its input, and the return value type is also updated accordingly to reflect this change.
