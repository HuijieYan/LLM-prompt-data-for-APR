The error is occurring in the `get_grouper` method due to a key error. It seems that the method is not handling the PeriodIndex properly, leading to the ValueError of "Given date string not likely a datetime."

The bug seems to be related to how the `get_grouper` method handles the grouping when using a PeriodIndex. It is likely that the method is not properly recognizing the keys or handling the PeriodIndex as it does with other types of indexes.

To fix the bug, the `get_grouper` method needs to be updated to handle PeriodIndex properly. This may involve differentiating the handling of PeriodIndex from other types of indexes and adjusting the logic to properly extract the group keys and handle the grouping operation for PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected `get_grouper` method:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (existing code)

    from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodIndex

    if isinstance(obj.index, PeriodIndex):  # New block to handle PeriodIndex
        if level is not None or key is not None:  # Currently not handling levels or keys for PeriodIndex
            raise ValueError("Grouping by level or key is not supported for PeriodIndex")

        if axis == 0:
            key = obj.index
        else:
            key = obj.columns
            level = obj.index

    # ... (rest of the code, unchanged)

    # The rest of the method remains the same
```

This code block adds a new block to handle the PeriodIndex separately. It sets the key and level based on the axis and updates the logic to handle PeriodIndex for grouping. This should address the ValueError related to the PeriodIndex grouping.
