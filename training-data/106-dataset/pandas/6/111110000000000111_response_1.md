Based on the issue description and the error message, it seems that the bug is related to operating on a PeriodIndex level. The error message "Given date string not likely a datetime" indicates that the function is trying to interpret a date string as a datetime, leading to a ValueError.

The potential error location within the function is where it checks if the group axis is a MultiIndex and handles the level and key accordingly. This part of the code seems to be causing issues with handling PeriodIndex.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling PeriodIndex as expected, leading to a ValueError when trying to operate on the level of the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the function to handle PeriodIndex properly.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle PeriodIndex properly
    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        # handle PeriodIndex level
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = ops.BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected function includes a specific handling for PeriodIndex to address the issues mentioned in the bug report.
