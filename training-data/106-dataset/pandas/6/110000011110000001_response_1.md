Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `get_grouper` function due to an issue with the `obj._get_axis` method, which leads to an exception being raised when attempting to get the location of a label in the index.

Reasons Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `obj` variable does not have a defined method `_get_axis`, or the method is not functioning as expected. This results in the inability to locate the label in the index, leading to a ValueError being raised.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `obj` variable is of the correct type that should have the `_get_axis` method. If it is not, it may need to be reassigned to the appropriate object.
2. Verify if the `_get_axis` method of the `obj` variable is implemented correctly and returns the expected result. If not, it needs to be fixed.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    if not hasattr(obj, "_get_axis"):
        raise AttributeError("The 'obj' parameter must have the '_get_axis' method")

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # the rest of the function remains the same
```
In the corrected code, a check has been added to verify if the `obj` parameter has the `_get_axis` method. If it does not, an AttributeError is raised to indicate the issue. This modification ensures that the `obj` parameter is of the correct type and has the necessary method before proceeding with the `_get_axis` method.
