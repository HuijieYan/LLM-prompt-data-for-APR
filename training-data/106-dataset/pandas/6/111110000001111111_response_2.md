The error occurs in the `get_grouper` function. It seems that the issue is related to the handling of `PeriodIndex` in the function. The specific error message "ValueError: Given date string not likely a datetime" suggests that there might be a problem when trying to interpret the date string as a datetime, especially when grouping by `PeriodIndex` level.

Upon examining the function, it is evident that there are several conditional checks and type validations related to `PeriodIndex` handling in the given function. The issue may arise from how the function handles `PeriodIndex` in the context of grouping and validation.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be considered:
1. Ensure that the handling of `PeriodIndex` in conditions and type validations is accurate and does not lead to contradictions or misinterpretations.
2. Verify the logic related to grouping and level validation specific to `PeriodIndex`.
3. This code can be optimized by removing redundant checks and reducing the complexity of if-else conditions to make it more readable and maintainable.
4. The internal logic for interpreting `PeriodIndex` as datetime or date string should be reviewed and adjusted if necessary to align with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_grouper` function after addressing the potential issues:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (existing code)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj._get_axis(axis).name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name "
                        f"of the {obj._get_axis_name(axis)}"
                    )
            elif not (-1 <= level < group_axis.nlevels):
                raise ValueError("level value out of range")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (remaining code)
```

It's essential to review and test the modified function with different scenarios involving `PeriodIndex` and ensure that the handling is correct.
