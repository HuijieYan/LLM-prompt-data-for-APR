The error occurs when attempting to use the `groupby` method on a `PeriodIndex` level within a `Series` object. The error message indicates that the given date string is not likely a datetime, suggesting a problem with parsing the date string as a datetime.

The potential error location within the `get_grouper` function is when checking if the grouping key is in the object. This check uses the `in` operator to verify if the key is present in the object, which may lead to issues with PeriodIndex.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the `PeriodIndex` level properly when checking if the given key is a datetime. This causes a ValueError to be raised when attempting to group by a PeriodIndex level.

To fix the bug, the function should handle `PeriodIndex` levels appropriately when checking if the given key is a datetime. This can be done by adding additional checks and parsing methods for `PeriodIndex` levels to ensure that the date string is correctly identified as a datetime.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def get_grouper(
    obj: pd.Series,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], pd.Series]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    
    ... (omitted code)

    """

    # (omitted code)

    if isinstance(level, pd.PeriodIndex):
        try:
            # Parse the key as a period and verify if it's a valid datetime
            pd.Period(key)
        except:
            raise ValueError('Given date string not likely a datetime.')

    # (omitted code)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected code includes a specific check for `PeriodIndex` levels when parsing the given key as a period and verifying that it's a valid datetime. This allows for appropriate handling of `PeriodIndex` levels, addressing the bug in grouping by `PeriodIndex` levels within a `Series` object.
