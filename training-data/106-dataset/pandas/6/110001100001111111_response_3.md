The error message suggests that the issue is related to a PeriodIndex. It seems that the code is not handling the PeriodIndex properly when trying to group by a level.

Looking at the code, the potential error location is in the `get_grouper` function, specifically in the section where it checks for the level and group axis types.

The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the level and group axis for a PeriodIndex. It does not properly handle the specific properties of a PeriodIndex, resulting in a ValueError when trying to group by level.

To fix the bug, the code should handle a PeriodIndex differently from a regular Index when checking for the level and group axis. It should take into account the specific properties and methods of a PeriodIndex to ensure proper grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (previous code)

    if level is not None and isinstance(obj.index, PeriodIndex):
        level_values = obj.index.to_timestamp().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        if level_values == level:
            key = obj.index

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected code, when the level is not None and the index is a PeriodIndex, it converts the PeriodIndex to a DatetimeIndex using `to_timestamp()` and then formats the level value to match the format of the DatetimeIndex. If the level value matches the converted PeriodIndex, it sets the key to the PeriodIndex.

This approach ensures that the PeriodIndex is handled properly when checking for the level and key in the grouping process.
