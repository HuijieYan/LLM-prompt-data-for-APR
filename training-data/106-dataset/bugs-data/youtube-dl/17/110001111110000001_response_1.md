The issue with the `cli_bool_option` function is that it assumes the `param` value is always present in the `params` dictionary, which is not the case for the last test in the test function. When the `param` value is not present, it defaults to `None`, which leads to the error when trying to access `None` as a boolean.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to check if the `param` value is present in the `params` dictionary before trying to access it. If it is not present, you can assume it is `false`.

Here's the corrected `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Set default to False if param is not present
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the `param` value is present. If it is present, the function will use its boolean value. If it is not present, the function will assume it is `false`.

This should fix the AssertionError that was occurring in the last test case, and the function should work as expected for all scenarios.
