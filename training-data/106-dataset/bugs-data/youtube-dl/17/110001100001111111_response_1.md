The issue seems to be with the `cli_bool_option` function, which is supposed to return a list of command line options based on the boolean value of a parameter. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `separator` parameter.

In the provided function, when `separator` is not None, the function returns a list with the command_option and the true_value/false_value separated by the separator. However, when `separator` is None, it returns a list with the command_option and true_value/false_value as separate elements.

The issue is that in the case where `separator` is None, the function should only return the command_option and true_value/false_value as separate elements, not as a list with the command_option and then true_value/false_value as separate elements.

To fix this bug, the function should return a list of the command_option, true_value, and false_value in all cases. This means that when separator is None, the function should not return the values as separate list items, but rather as elements of a list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value, false_value]
```
