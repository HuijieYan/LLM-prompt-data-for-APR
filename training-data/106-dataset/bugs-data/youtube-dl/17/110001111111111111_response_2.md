The error message indicates that the `param` variable is `None`, which leads to the `assert` statement failing. This means that the `params.get(param)` expression is returning `None` for the given `param`, which causes the bug.

The root cause of the bug is that the `params.get(param)` call is returning `None`, which means that the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary. We can do this by providing a default value for the `param` variable when it is not found in the `params` dictionary. 

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Providing a default value of False if param is not found
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

This code ensures that if the `param` key is not present in the `params` dictionary, it defaults to `False` and the `assert` statement should not fail.
