The error seems to occur in the `process_ie_result` function of the `YoutubeDL` class, particularly when trying to select the requested format. 

The reason for the bug may be due to the incomplete formats which are being filtered through the format selector, resulting in the requested format not being available.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_build_format_filter` function to handle the format filtering logic correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    def _filter(f):
        key = filter_spec.split('=')[0]
        value = filter_spec.split('=')[1]
        actual_value = f.get(key)
        
        if actual_value is None:
            return False

        if '=' in filter_spec:
            return actual_value == value
        elif '!=' in filter_spec:
            return actual_value != value
        elif '^=' in filter_spec:
            return actual_value.startswith(value)
        elif '!^=' in filter_spec:
            return not actual_value.startswith(value)
        elif '$=' in filter_spec:
            return actual_value.endswith(value)
        elif '!$=' in filter_spec:
            return not actual_value.endswith(value)
        elif '*=' in filter_spec:
            return value in actual_value
        elif '!*=' in filter_spec:
            return value not in actual_value
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)

    return _filter
```
In the corrected code, we simplified the filter logic and removed unnecessary complex parsing and comparison steps. This should hopefully fix the format selection issue.

Please note that this correction assumes that the format selection logic is correctly implemented elsewhere in the code. If the issue persists, it may require further investigation beyond the scope of the `_build_format_filter` function.
