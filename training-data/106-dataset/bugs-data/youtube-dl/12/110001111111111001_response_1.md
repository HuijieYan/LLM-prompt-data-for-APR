The bug seems to be in the `_build_format_filter` method. The method is not correctly processing the filters specified in the `filter_spec`. This is leading to incorrect format selection, as evident from the test case failures.

The reasons behind the bug could be:
1. Incorrect parsing and processing of filter specifications, resulting in incorrect format filtering.
2. Failure to properly handle different filter operators like '=', '!=', '^=', '$=', '*='.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_build_format_filter` method to correctly parse and process the filter specifications provided in the `filter_spec`.
2. Ensure that the different filter operators are handled properly to filter the formats correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` method:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    # ... previous code ...

    # Add proper processing for the filter specifications
    formats = self.extract_format_info()  # Assuming the method to extract format information exists
    selected_formats = []
    for spec in filter_spec.split(','):
        # Process each filter specification
        key, op, value = spec.split(op, 2)
        op = op.strip()
        filter_func = None
        if op == '=':
            filter_func = lambda f: f.get(key) == value
        elif op == '!=':
            filter_func = lambda f: f.get(key) != value
        elif op == '^=':
            filter_func = lambda f: f.get(key).startswith(value)
        elif op == '$=':
            filter_func = lambda f: f.get(key).endswith(value)
        elif op == '*=':
            filter_func = lambda f: value in f.get(key, '')
        
        if filter_func:
            selected_formats.extend(filter(filter_func, formats))

    return selected_formats
```

By updating the `_build_format_filter` method to correctly process the filter specifications, the bug should be fixed.
