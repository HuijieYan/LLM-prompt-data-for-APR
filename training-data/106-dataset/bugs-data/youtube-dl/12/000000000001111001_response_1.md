The buggy function is `_build_format_filter`. This function is designed to build a filter for different formats based on the specified criteria. The function takes a filter specification string as input and returns a filter function.

In the provided function, there are conditional blocks that check for numeric comparison operators, string comparison operators, and raise an error if the filter specification is invalid. However, the implementation of these conditional blocks is incorrect.

It seems that the `if` statements are not nested correctly, causing unexpected behavior when handling different types of comparison operators.

To fix this issue, the conditional checks should be properly nested and aligned, and the appropriate comparisons based on the filter specification should be performed within the correct conditional blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
import re
import operator

def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    STR_OPERATORS = {
        '=': operator.eq,
        '^=': lambda attr, value: attr.startswith(value),
        '$=': lambda attr, value: attr.endswith(value),
        '*=': lambda attr, value: value in attr,
    }

    operator_rex = re.compile(r'\s*(?P<op><|<=|>|>=|!=|=)\s*(?P<value>.+)')
    str_operator_rex = re.compile(r'\s*(?P<op>=|\^=|\$=|\*=)(?P<value>.+)')

    m = operator_rex.match(filter_spec)
    if m:
        op = OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        comparison_value = m.group('value')
        def _filter(f):
            actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(int(actual_value), int(comparison_value))
        return _filter

    m = str_operator_rex.match(filter_spec)
    if m:
        str_op = STR_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        comparison_value = m.group('value')
        if m.group('negation'):
            op = lambda attr, value: not str_op
        else:
            op = str_op
        def _filter(f):
            actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
        return _filter

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)
```

In this corrected code, the conditional blocks are directly under each `if` and `else` statement. The correct regular expressions are also used to match the filter specification string. The correct comparison value is extracted based on the match, and the comparison function is applied accordingly. Finally, a `ValueError` is raised for an invalid filter specification.

This should resolve the issues present in the original `_build_format_filter` function.
