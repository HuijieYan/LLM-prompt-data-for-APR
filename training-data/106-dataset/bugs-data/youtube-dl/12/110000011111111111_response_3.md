The bug seems to be occurring in the format filter logic for the YoutubeDL class. The error message suggests that the requested format is not available, which indicates that the format filter is not working as expected.

The potential error location is likely within the format filter logic where the comparison between the filter specification and the available formats is being performed. This could be due to incorrect comparisons or mismatches between the filter specification and the format attributes.

The bug occurs because the format filter logic is not accurately matching the filter specification with the available format attributes. This can be due to issues with the comparison operators or the attribute values being compared.

To fix the bug, the format filter logic needs to be revised to ensure accurate matching of the filter specifications with the available format attributes. This may involve reviewing the comparison operators, attribute values, and the overall logic of the format filter function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "
    m = re.match(r'format_id([<>=!^\*]+)=([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)', filter_spec)
    
    if m:
        key = 'format_id'
        op = m.group(1)
        value = m.group(2)
        
        def _filter(f):
            actual_value = f.get(key)
            if actual_value is None:
                return False
            if op == '=':
                return actual_value == value
            elif op == '!=':
                return actual_value != value
            elif op == '^=':
                return actual_value.startswith(value)
            elif op == '$=':
                return actual_value.endswith(value)
            elif op == '*=':
                return value in actual_value
        return _filter
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)
```

This updated function includes a more precise pattern matching for the filter specification and defines the filtering logic based on the matched operator and value. This should ensure that the format filter accurately filters the formats according to the filter_spec.
