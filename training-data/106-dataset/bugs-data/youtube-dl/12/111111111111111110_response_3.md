    YoutubeDL class.
    
    YoutubeDL objects are the ones responsible of downloading the
    actual video file and writing it to disk if the user has requested
    it, among some other tasks. In most cases there should be one per
    program. As, given a video URL, the downloader doesn't know how to
    extract all the needed information, task that InfoExtractors do, it
    has to pass the URL to one of them.
    
    For this, YoutubeDL objects have a method that allows
    InfoExtractors to be registered in a given order. When it is passed
    a URL, the YoutubeDL object handles it to the first InfoExtractor it
    finds that reports being able to handle it. The InfoExtractor extracts
    all the information about the video or videos the URL refers to, and
    YoutubeDL process the extracted information, possibly using a File
    Downloader to download the video.
    
    YoutubeDL objects accept a lot of parameters. In order not to saturate
    the object constructor with arguments, it receives a dictionary of
    options instead. These options are available through the params
    attribute for the InfoExtractors to use. The YoutubeDL also
    registers itself as the downloader in charge for the InfoExtractors
    that are added to it, so this is a "mutual registration".
    
    Available options:
    
    username:          Username for authentication purposes.
    password:          Password for authentication purposes.
    videopassword:     Password for accessing a video.
    ap_mso:            Adobe Pass multiple-system operator identifier.
    ap_username:       Multiple-system operator account username.
    ap_password:       Multiple-system operator account password.
    ...
    include_ads:       Download ads as well
    default_search:    Prepend this string if an input url is not valid.
                       'auto' for elaborate guessing
    encoding:          Use this encoding instead of the system-specified.
    extract_flat:      Do not resolve URLs, return the immediate result.
                       Pass in 'in_playlist' to only show this behavior for
                       playlist items.
    postprocessors:    A list of dictionaries, each with an entry
                       * key:  The name of the postprocessor. See
                               youtube_dl/postprocessor/__init__.py for a list.
                       as well as any further keyword arguments for the
                       postprocessor.
    progress_hooks:    A list of functions that get called on download
                       progress, with a dictionary with the entries
                       * status: One of "downloading", "error", or "finished".
                                 Check this first and ignore unknown values.
    
                       If status is one of "downloading", or "finished", the
                       following properties may also be present:
                       * filename: The final filename (always present)
                       * tmpfilename: The filename we're currently writing to
                       * downloaded_bytes: Bytes on disk
                       * total_bytes: Size of the whole file, None if unknown
                       * total_bytes_estimate: Guess of the eventual file size,
                                               None if unavailable.
                       * elapsed: The number of seconds since download started.
                       * eta: The estimated time in seconds, None if unknown
                       * speed: The download speed in bytes/second, None if
                                unknown
                       * fragment_index: The counter of the currently
                                         downloaded video fragment.
                       * fragment_count: The number of fragments (= individual
                                         files that will be merged)
    
                       Progress hooks are guaranteed to be called at least once
                       (with status "finished") if the download is successful.
    merge_output_format: Extension to use when merging formats.
    fixup:             Automatically correct known faults of the file.
                       One of:
                       - "never": do nothing
                       - "warn": only emit a warning
                       - "detect_or_warn": check whether we can do anything
                                           about it, warn otherwise (default)
    ...

    youtube_include_dash_manifest: If True (default), DASH manifests and related
                        data will be downloaded and processed by extractor.
                        You can reduce network I/O by disabling it if you don't
                        care about DASH.
