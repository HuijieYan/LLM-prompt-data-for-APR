The test case `test_format_selection_string_ops` tests the string operations of the `_filter` function in the YoutubeDL class, specifically for filtering formats according to the `filter_spec`.

The expected error message indicates that the requested format is not available. This suggests that the `_build_format_filter` function is not processing the `filter_spec` correctly, leading to invalid format selection.

The potential error location within the `_build_format_filter` function is the processing of the `filter_spec` using regular expressions and comparison operators. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the comparison rules and applying them to select the appropriate formats.

The error occurred because the function failed to correctly interpret the filter specifications provided in the `format` parameter. This caused the format selection to result in an empty list of formats to download.

To fix the bug, the `_build_format_filter` function needs to correctly interpret the filter specifications and apply the comparison operators to filter the formats based on the provided `filter_spec`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    # ... (other code)

    def _filter(f):
        if m:
            actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return bool(m.group('none_inclusive'))
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

        if not m:
            actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return bool(m.group('none_inclusive'))
            return str_op(actual_value, comparison_value)

        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)

    return _filter
```

In this corrected code, the function incorporates correct handling of the filter specifications, including the use of regular expressions, comparison operators, and string operations to correctly filter the formats based on the `filter_spec`. This should ensure that the formats are accurately selected and filtered based on the provided criteria.
