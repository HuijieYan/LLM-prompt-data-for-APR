The error message indicates that there is a problem with the format selection in the `YoutubeDL` class. The `process_ie_result` method is unable to find the requested format, resulting in an ExtractorError.

The potential error location within the `YoutubeDL` class is the `_build_format_filter` method. This method is used to filter the formats according to the filter specification provided. The bug may be related to how the filter specification is being applied to the formats.

It seems that the bug is causing the filter specification to not match any formats, resulting in the ExtractorError. This could be due to issues in parsing the filter specification and applying the filter to the formats.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the filter specification is correctly parsed and applied to the formats. We should also consider handling cases where the filter specification does not match any formats, to prevent the ExtractorError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` method:

```python
import re
import operator

def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
        " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "
    
        OPERATORS = {
            '<': operator.lt,
            '<=': operator.le,
            '>': operator.gt,
            '>=': operator.ge,
            '=': operator.eq,
            '!=': operator.ne,
        }
        
        operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
            (?P<key>width|height|tbr|abr|vbr|asr|filesize|filesize_approx|fps)
            \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
            (?P<value>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)
            $
            ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, OPERATORS.keys())))
        
        m = operator_rex.search(filter_spec)
        if m:
            comparison_value = int(m.group('value'))
            op = OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        else:
            ...
            # Handle the case when the filter is based on string operators
        
        def _filter(f):
            actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
        return _filter
```
Please note that the code snippet provided is a partial fix, and it contains a placeholder for handling the cases when the filter is based on string operators. This part needs to be completed based on the specific requirements.

Additionally, the code for handling string operators and the cases when the filter does not match any formats should also be completed as per the requirements.
