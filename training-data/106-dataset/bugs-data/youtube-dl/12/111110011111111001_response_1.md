The error occurs in the process_ie_result method, where the format filtering is not working as expected. The bug is located within the _build_format_filter method of the YoutubeDL class.

The reason behind the bug is that the _build_format_filter method is not correctly parsing and filtering the formats according to the filter_spec. It fails to properly evaluate the operator and comparison values, leading to incorrect filtering of the formats.

To fix the bug, the _build_format_filter method needs to be modified. The parsing logic for the filter_spec should be improved and the operators such as '=', '!=', '^=', '$=', '*=', etc. should be properly handled to filter the formats based on the given filter_spec.

Here is the corrected code for the _build_format_filter method:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    def _filter(f):
        nonlocal filter_spec

        key_value_pair = filter_spec.split('=')

        if len(key_value_pair) == 2:
            key, value = key_value_pair
            return key in f and f[key] == value
        else:
            key = key_value_pair[0]
            value = key_value_pair[1:]
            if key not in f:
                return False
            for val in value:
                if f[key].startswith('^') and f[key].endswith('$'):
                    if f[key][1:-1] not in val:
                        return False
                elif f[key].startswith('^'):
                    if not f[key][1:] in val:
                        return False
                elif f[key].endswith('$'):
                    if not f[key][:-1] in val:
                        return False
                elif val in f[key]:
                    return True
            return False

    return _filter
```

This corrected code should properly handle the filter_spec to filter the formats based on the specified criteria. After applying this correction, the format selection process should work as expected, and the bug should be fixed.
