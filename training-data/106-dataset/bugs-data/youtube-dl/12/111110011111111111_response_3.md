The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison step where the format selector attempts to match the requested format with the available formats. This comparison step seems to be failing to identify the correct format, resulting in the error message.

The bug likely occurred because the comparison logic within the function `_build_format_filter` is not accurately identifying the specified formats.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be updated to ensure that the specified formats are accurately identified and selected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>format_id)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)
        $
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_spec)
    if m:
        comparison_value = m.group('value')
        op = OPERATORS[m.group('op')]

    def _filter(f):
        actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
    return _filter
```

This corrected code should address the issue with format selection. However, additional testing is recommended to ensure that the bug has been fully resolved.
