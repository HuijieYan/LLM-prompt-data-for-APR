The error occurs when the input entity is `'#2013266066'`. The function tries to convert this into a character using the `compat_chr` function. The error message indicates that the value passed to `compat_chr` is out of range.

The bug occurs in the `_htmlentity_transform` function. When the input entity consists of numeric characters, it is supposed to be converted into a character. However, the bug causes it to fail for certain large numbers.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle large input numbers correctly. We can also update the regular expression to ensure correct matching and extraction of numbers, and change the type and base of the resulting character.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import html.entities as entities
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0' + numstr[1:]  # Remove the leading 'x'
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if num <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the number is within the valid Unicode range
            return chr(num)
        else:
            return ''  # Return empty string for invalid characters

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return '&' + entity + ';'
```

With this corrected function, the bug should be fixed, and the test cases should pass without errors.
