The bug in the provided function is that it uses undefined functions `compat_chr` and `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint`. Additionally, the `re` module needs to be imported for the regular expression to work.

The potential error location is the first `if` condition where it checks if the entity is in `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint`. This is undefined and needs to be replaced with a different method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the usage of undefined methods and missing import for the `re` module.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` mapping or use a different method to handle the conversion of HTML entities to characters. Additionally, we need to import the `re` module for regular expression functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Define the mapping for HTML entities to characters
    html_entity_map = {
        'amp': '&',
        'lt': '<',
        'gt': '>',
        'quot': '"',
        'apos': "'",
        'eacute': 'Ã©'  # Define other common entities as needed
        # Add more entity mappings as needed
    }

    if entity in html_entity_map:
        return html_entity_map[entity]

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we define a mapping `html_entity_map` to handle common HTML entities to characters transformation. For other cases, if the entity matches the regular expression, we extract the number and convert it to a character using the `chr` function. For unknown entities, we return them in their literal representation.
