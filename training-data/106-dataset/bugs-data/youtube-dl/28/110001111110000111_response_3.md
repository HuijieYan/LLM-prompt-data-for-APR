The error occurs within the `_htmlentity_transform` function when trying to convert the HTML entity "&#2013266066" to a character. The bug is caused by the use of `compat_chr` to convert an integer to a Unicode character, which raises a ValueError because the integer is outside the valid Unicode range.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `_htmlentity_transform` function to handle large integer values by returning their literal representation instead of trying to convert them to characters.
2. Use regex to match HTML entities in the `unescapeHTML` function instead of trying to convert them directly in `_htmlentity_transform`.

The corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function is as follows:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        return '&' + numstr + ';'
    else:
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this corrected function, the ValueError caused by attempting to convert large integers to Unicode characters should be resolved.
