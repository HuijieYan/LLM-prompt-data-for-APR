The error is occurring because the function _htmlentity_transform is using the unichr function, which is not available in Python 3. The unichr function has been removed in Python 3 and replaced with the chr function.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the call to the unichr function with the chr function.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
import re

# this is the fixed function
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this fix, the function should work correctly in both Python 2 and Python 3 environments.
