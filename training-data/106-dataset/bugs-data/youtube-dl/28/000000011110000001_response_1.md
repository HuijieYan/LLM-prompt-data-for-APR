The test case 'self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&#2013266066;'), '&#2013266066;')' seems to be causing the error. The error message implies that the 'ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000)' is occurring while trying to transform the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' into a character using the '_htmlentity_transform' function.

The potential error location is within the 'return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))' statement in the '_htmlentity_transform' function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to convert an HTML entity to a character using the 'compat_chr' function, which eventually calls the 'chr' function. However, the character code is out of the valid Unicode range, causing the 'ValueError' to be raised.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to check whether the character code is within the valid Unicode range before attempting to convert it to a character. If the character code is not within the valid range, return a placeholder or handle it differently based on the specific requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the '_htmlentity_transform' function:

```python
import sys

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    valid_range = sys.maxunicode + 1  # Max valid Unicode code point + 1

    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10

        # Check if the character code is within the valid Unicode range
        char_code = int(numstr, base)
        if char_code < valid_range:
            return compat_chr(char_code)
        else:
            return '?'  # Placeholder for out-of-range characters
    else:
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In this corrected code, the character code is checked to ensure that it falls within the valid Unicode range before attempting to convert it into a character. If the character code is out of range, a placeholder character '?' is returned.
