Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:` because `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is not defined in the given function.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` is not defined within the scope of the function, and therefore the function is unable to access it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define `compat_html_entities` or import it within the scope of the function.
2. Use a different data source for the HTML entities if `compat_html_entities` is not available.

Corrected Code:
```python
import html.entities as htmlentities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
In the corrected code, the `html.entities` module is used instead of `compat_html_entities`. The function now uses `html.entities.name2codepoint` to check for HTML entities and `chr` to return the corresponding character.
