The test case includes the unescapeHTML function being tested with input '&#2013266066;' and expecting an output of '&#2013266066;'. The error message indicates a ValueError at line 411 in the function _htmlentity_transform when trying to transform the entity '&#2013266066;' to a character.

The potential error location is within the if condition where the entity is being transformed. The issue is that the value '&#2013266066;' is larger than the maximum character value supported by the chr() function.

The bug occurs because the chr() function in Python only accepts integers in the range of 0 to 0x10FFFF (inclusive) to produce valid Unicode characters.

An approach to fix the bug would be to add a validation to check if the entity value is within the valid range before using the chr() function. If the entity is not within the valid range, an alternative action can be taken, such as returning the original entity.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        num = int(numstr, base)
        if 0 <= num <= 0x10FFFF:  # Validate if the number is within the valid range
            return compat_chr(num)
        else:
            return entity  # Return the original entity if the number is not valid

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
