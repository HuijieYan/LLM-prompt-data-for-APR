Potential error:
The code is referencing `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr`, but these are not defined within the provided function. Additionally, the `re` module is used without being imported.

Reason for the bug:
The function is trying to use `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` without importing or defining them. Additionally, it is using the `re` module without importing it.

Possible approaches:
1. Import the necessary modules and define the missing functions if they are external dependencies.
2. If `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` are not external dependencies, define them within the function.

Corrected code:
```python
import html.entities
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
