The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that there is an issue with the code trying to return a character value beyond the allowable range in Python.

The potential error location within the function is in the line that returns the character using `compat_chr(int(numstr, base))`.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to return a character value that is beyond the allowable Unicode range in Python. The `unichr()` function in Python 2.x is limited to the Unicode range up to 0x10FFFF. When the code attempts to convert a number larger than this range into a character, it raises the ValueError.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the case when the number is beyond the allowable Unicode range and replace it with an appropriate representation, such as the placeholder symbol '�'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        value = int(numstr, base)
        # Check if the value is within the allowable Unicode range
        if 0 <= value <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(value)
        else:
            # If the value is beyond the allowable range, return a placeholder character
            return '�'

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the integer value from the HTML entity, it checks if the value is within the allowable Unicode range. If it is, it returns the corresponding character. Otherwise, it returns a placeholder character '�' to indicate an out-of-range value.
