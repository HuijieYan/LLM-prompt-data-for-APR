The error "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)" is caused by passing an argument to unichr() that is not in the valid Unicode range. This suggests that there is an issue with the conversion of HTML entities to characters within the _htmlentity_transform function.

The issue is likely due to the method by which the function handles the transformation of HTML entities into characters. It seems that the function is unable to properly handle numeric HTML entities.

To fix this issue, we need to update the _htmlentity_transform function to ensure that it correctly transforms both known non-numeric HTML entities and numeric HTML entities into characters. This can be achieved by using the correct encoding standards for HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
import re
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    try:
        return html.unescape(entity)
    except:
        return entity
```

In this corrected version, we use the html module to correctly handle the transformation of HTML entities into characters. This ensures that both non-numeric and numeric HTML entities are properly decoded.

By using the html.unescape() function, we can handle both named and numeric character references, providing a more robust solution for transforming HTML entities into characters.
