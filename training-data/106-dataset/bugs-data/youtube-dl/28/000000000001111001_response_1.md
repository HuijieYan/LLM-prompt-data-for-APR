The bug in the provided function is that it uses `compat_chr` and `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` without importing or defining these functions. This causes the function to throw a NameError.

To fix this bug, the function should import the necessary libraries, such as `html.entities`, in order to access the `name2codepoint` dictionary. Additionally, the `compat_chr` function should be defined or replaced with the built-in `chr` function, as it's not clear what the `compat_chr` function does.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
