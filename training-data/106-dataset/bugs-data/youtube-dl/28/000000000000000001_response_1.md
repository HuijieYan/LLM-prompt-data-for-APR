Potential error location: The potential error lies in the function's reliance on the `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` variables which are not defined within the function. Additionally, the `re` module is used without being imported.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the code is trying to use variables and a module that have not been properly defined or imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Define the `compat_html_entities` and `compat_chr` variables within the function or pass them as arguments to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity, compat_html_entities, compat_chr):
    
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
