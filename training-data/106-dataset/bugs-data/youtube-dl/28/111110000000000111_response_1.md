The error message "ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000) (wide Python build)" indicates that the function _htmlentity_transform is trying to handle a Unicode character that is outside the valid range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement:
```python
return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to convert a Unicode character using the compat_chr function, which is resulting in a ValueError because the character is not within the valid range.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where the Unicode character is outside the valid range. One approach is to use a try-except block to catch the ValueError and return a placeholder character. Another approach is to filter out the characters outside the valid range before trying to convert them.

Here's the corrected code for the _htmlentity_transform function:

```python
import re
import html.entities as compat_html_entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            char_code = int(numstr, base)
            if 0 <= char_code <= 0x10FFFF:  # Check if the character is within the valid range
                return compat_chr(char_code)
            else:
                return ''  # Return a placeholder or empty string for characters outside the valid range
        except ValueError:
            return ''  # Return a placeholder or empty string for characters that cannot be converted
    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
