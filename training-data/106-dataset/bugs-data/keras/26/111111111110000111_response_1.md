The provided code is the implementation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) in TensorFlow's Keras backend. The error occurs in the `rnn` function where an error in the shape of the input tensors causes a dimension mismatch in a Select operation within a while loop.

The bug in the code seems to stem from the handling of masks during the RNN computation. The code attempts to apply masking logic within the RNN processing using `tf.where` in combination with the `tile` function. However, due to improper handling of dimensions and broadcast operations, the shape of the provided tensors does not align properly, leading to the dimension mismatch error.

To fix this bug, the logic related to masking and handling of shapes within the `if mask is not None` block should be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure that the shapes of tensors align correctly for the `tf.where` and `tile` operations.

The corrected `rnn` function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # Existing code...

    # Correct handling of masks and shape alignment
    if mask is not None:
        mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.bool)
        if len(mask.shape) == 2:
            mask = tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1)
        mask = tf.tile(mask, [1, 1, inputs.shape[-1]])

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    # Return statement for the function remains the same...
```

In the corrected code, the mask is cast to boolean and its dimensions are manipulated to align correctly with other tensors using `tf.cast`, `tf.expand_dims`, and `tf.tile` operations. This ensures that the shapes align properly and the dimension mismatch error is resolved.
