The potential error location within the problematic function is a mix-up in variable names. The function parameter 'inputs' is being overwritten with a new value, which is causing the variable to be incorrectly referenced later on in the function. This is likely the reason for the bug.

To fix this bug, the function parameter 'inputs' should be renamed to a different variable name, such as 'input_tensor', to avoid overwriting it within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, input_tensor, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """
    Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    """
    # ... rest of the function ...
```
