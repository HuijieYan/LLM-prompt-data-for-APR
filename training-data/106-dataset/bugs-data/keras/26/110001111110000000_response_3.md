The function `rnn` in the `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py` file uses the incorrect dimension for transposing, which leads to a shape mismatch error in the `Select` operation. Here's the corrected function with the dimension for transposing fixed:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (other code)

    # Transpose to time-major, i.e.
    # from (batch, time, ...) to (time, batch, ...)
    inputs = tf.transpose(inputs, [1, 0] + list(range(2, ndim)))

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By specifying the axes of the transposition directly `[1, 0] + list(range(2, ndim))`, it ensures the correct dimensions are used for transposing the input tensor, preventing the shape mismatch error in the subsequent operations.
