The error occurs in the `rnn` function, specifically within the `_step` method when using `tf.where` to handle the `mask` input. The error message indicates a dimension mismatch within the `tf.where` operation.

The bug occurs because the shapes of the tensors involved in the `tf.where` operation are not compatible. The error message specifically states that "Dimension 1 in both shapes must be equal, but are 6 and 3."

This issue can be resolved by ensuring that the shapes of the tensors passed to `tf.where` are compatible. This can be done by appropriately reshaping or broadcasting tensors to ensure the dimensions match where required.

Below is the corrected code for the `rnn` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    # Inside the _step function, replace the tf.where usage with broadcasting and element-wise multiplication
    if mask is not None:
        # Other code remains the same
        for state, new_state in zip(states, new_states):
            # Use broadcasting and element-wise multiplication to apply the mask
            new_state = new_state * tf.cast(tiled_mask_t, new_state.dtype)
            return_states.append(new_state)

    return last_output, outputs, new_states
``` 

In the corrected code, the problematic `tf.where` operation has been replaced with broadcasting and element-wise multiplication, which ensures that the dimensions of the tensors are compatible and resolves the dimension mismatch issue.
