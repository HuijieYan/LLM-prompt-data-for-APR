The error message indicates a dimension mismatch while performing the 'Select' operation within the '_step' function of the 'rnn' method. This could be due to incorrect handling of tensor shapes.

The potential error is within the code block where the 'Select' operation is being performed inside the '_step' function. Specifically, the problem arises when trying to execute the 'tf.where' function with tensors of incompatible shapes.

The bug occurs because the shape of the input tensors in the 'Select' operation is not compatible. This can be caused by improper handling of the input tensor shapes, especially when using the 'mask' parameter.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the input tensor shapes are compatible for the 'Select' operation, especially when considering the 'mask' parameter. It's also important to handle the tensor dimensions properly while using the 'tf.where' function within the '_step' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'rnn' method:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
    go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
    unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    if mask is not None:
        if mask.dtype != tf.bool:
            mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.bool)
        if len(mask.get_shape()) == ndim - 2: # reduce the rank to match the inputs
            mask = tf.expand_dims(mask, -1)  # add an extra dimension to match 'inputs'
        mask = tf.transpose(mask, axes)

    if constants is None:
        constants = []

    global uses_learning_phase
    uses_learning_phase = False

    # Transpose inputs to time-major
    axes = [1, 0] + list(range(2, ndim))
    inputs = tf.transpose(inputs, axes)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the adjustments are made to ensure compatibility of tensor shapes, especially when dealing with the 'mask' parameter, and appropriate handling of dimensions for the 'tf.where' operations.
