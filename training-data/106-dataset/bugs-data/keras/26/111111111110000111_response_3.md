The error occurs in the `rnn` function in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_26/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py`. The error message indicates a dimension mismatch error between shapes [4, 6] and [4, 3] during the execution of a 'Select' operation inside a while loop.

The root cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect shape compatibility between the input tensors inside the while loop when performing the 'Select' operation. This could be due to incorrect shape manipulation or tensor operations within the `rnn` function.

To fix this bug, the shape compatibility and tensor operations within the while loop need to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Specifically, the shape of the input tensors and the 'Select' operation inside the while loop should be validated to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `rnn` function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    with tf.variable_scope('rnn'):
        # Add explicit shapes to the initial states to ensure consistency
        if mask is not None and len(initial_states) > 0:
            batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
            for i in range(len(initial_states)):
                initial_states[i].set_shape([batch_size, output_dim])
        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
        return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly set the shape of the initial states based on the batch size to ensure consistency. Additionally, other parts of the code within the `rnn` function should be checked and tested to ensure that the dimensions of the tensors match properly during the while loop execution.
