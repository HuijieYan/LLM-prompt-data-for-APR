Potential error location: The error may occur in the condition checking for the dimension of the input in the `rnn` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function `rnn` is checking the dimension of the input tensor incorrectly, leading to a ValueError being raised when attempting to validate the input dimension.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the dimension checking logic to accurately validate the input tensor's dimension.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # existing code...

    if len(inputs.get_shape()) < 3:
        raise ValueError('Input should be at least 3D.')

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, the `ndim` variable has been updated to use `len(inputs.get_shape())` for accurately determining the dimension of the input tensor. If the dimension is less than 3, a ValueError will be raised, as specified.
