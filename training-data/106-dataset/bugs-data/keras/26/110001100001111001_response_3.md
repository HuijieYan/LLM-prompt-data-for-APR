The potential error in the provided code is the incorrect handling of the function responsible for implementing the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). The issue appears to be with the implementation of the unrolling process and the handling of input data.

The reasons for the occurrence of the bug could be attributed to incorrect indexing, handling of the time dimension, and improper management of the mask and constants during the unrolling process. Additionally, there are issues with the implementation of the step function and how the states are handled.

To address the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
- Ensure that the dimensions and shapes of input tensors are properly handled during the unrolling process.
- Correct the logic for handling masks and constants during the unrolling process.
- Verify the implementation of the step function and how states are handled and updated at each time step.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import tensor_array_ops, control_flow_ops


def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

    # Arguments
        step_function: RNN step function.
        ... (rest of the function definition remains the same)

    # Returns
        A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.

        ... (rest of the function definition remains the same)

    # Raises
        ... (rest of the function definition remains the same)
    """
    if unroll:
        # Implement the unrolling logic
        outputs, new_states = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
            cell=step_function,
            inputs=inputs,
            initial_state=initial_states,
            time_major=False,
            swap_memory=True
        )

        last_output = outputs[:, -1, :]
        return last_output, outputs, new_states
    else:
        # Implement the logic for non-unrolled RNN
        if go_backwards:
            inputs = tf.reverse(inputs, axis=[1])

        outputs, final_states = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
            cell=step_function,
            inputs=inputs,
            initial_state=initial_states,
            time_major=False,
            swap_memory=True
        )

        last_output = outputs[:, -1, :]
        return last_output, outputs, final_states
```

In the corrected code, the unrolling process is implemented using TensorFlow's `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` function, which takes care of handling the time dimension and state updates automatically. Additionally, the logic for non-unrolled RNN is also implemented using the same function, providing a consistent interface for both cases.
