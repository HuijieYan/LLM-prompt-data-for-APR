The potential error location within the problematic function is in the unroll part, where the 'for' loop is used to iterate over the time dimension. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the mask when unrolling the RNN.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the mask and states are not being handled properly when unrolling the RNN. Additionally, the use of 'return' inside the loop does not allow the loop to continue iterating as intended.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the mask and states during the unrolling process, and to ensure that the loop continues iterating as intended.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (same function signature as before)

    # Correctly handle the unroll part to iterate over the time dimension
    if unroll:
        # ... (existing code for ndim check, transpose, and constants initialization)

        if not inputs.get_shape().is_fully_defined():
            raise ValueError('Unrolling requires a '
                             'fixed number of timesteps.')

        # Use tf.while_loop for unrolling the RNN
        def body(time, outputs_ta, states):
            current_input = tf.gather(inputs, time)
            output, new_states = step_function(current_input, states + constants)
            outputs_ta = outputs_ta.write(time, output)
            return time + 1, outputs_ta, new_states

        def condition(time, outputs_ta, states):
            return time < input_length

        initial_time = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
        outputs_ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=inputs.dtype, size=input_length)
        _, outputs_final_ta, new_states = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [initial_time, outputs_ta, initial_states])

        outputs = outputs_final_ta.stack()
        last_output = outputs_final_ta.read(input_length - 1)

        axes = [1, 0] + list(range(2, len(outputs.get_shape().as_list())))
        outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, axes)

    else:
        # ... (existing code for reversing inputs in go_backwards condition)

        # Use tf.scan for looping over the time dimension
        outputs, new_states = tf.scan(fn=step_function, elems=inputs, initializer=initial_states + constants)

        if go_backwards:
            outputs = tf.reverse(outputs, axis=[0])

        last_output = outputs[-1]

    last_output._uses_learning_phase = True  # Set learning phase as True for the last output
    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

In the corrected code, the unrolling process is handled using `tf.while_loop` and `tf.scan` for looping over the time dimension based on the `unroll` flag. The handling of states and constants is also modified to ensure proper iteration and processing. Additionally, the learning phase for the last output is set correctly.
