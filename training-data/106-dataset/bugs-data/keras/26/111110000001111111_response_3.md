The potential error in the provided RNN function is that it does not handle the case where the input dimension is less than 3, which leads to a ValueError being raised. This occurs due to the check for input dimension being less than 3 using the `ndim` variable and the subsequent ValueError being raised if the condition is not met.

To fix this bug, one approach is to handle the case where the input dimension is less than 3 by checking the input dimension and raising an error if it is less than 3.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic RNN function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.util import nest
from tensorflow.python.ops import tensor_array_ops
from tensorflow.python.ops import control_flow_ops

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # Check if input dimension is less than 3
    if len(inputs.get_shape()) < 3:
        raise ValueError('Input should be at least 3D.')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    # ...
    # ...

    axes = [1, 0] + list(range(2, len(outputs.get_shape())))
    outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, axes)
    last_output._uses_learning_phase = uses_learning_phase
    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

In the corrected code, the input dimension is checked using `len(inputs.get_shape())` and if it is less than 3, a ValueError is raised. This fixes the bug related to handling the input dimension and prevents the ValueError from being raised in such cases.
