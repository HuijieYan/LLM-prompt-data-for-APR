The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function is checking the shape of the input to determine if it is at least 3D.

The error occurs because the function is checking the wrong dimension of the input. The function should be checking the first dimension (which represents the batch size) rather than the overall dimensions of the input.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to check the correct dimension of the input. Additionally, we should handle the case where the input has a dynamic or unknown batch size.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # Check if the input is at least 3D
    if inputs.shape.ndims < 3:
        raise ValueError('Input should be at least 3D.')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged below...
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...
```
