The error message mentions a shape mismatch: "Dimension 1 in both shapes must be equal, but are 6 and 3. Shapes are [4,6] and [4,3]". This indicates that there is a dimension mismatch in shapes during the Select operation in the `_step` function of the `rnn` method.

The error occurs because the input shapes do not match when the `tf.where` function is used in the `_step` function of the `rnn` method.

To fix this bug, ensure that the shapes are compatible before performing the `tf.where` operation. This can be done by verifying the shapes and adjusting them accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `rnn` method:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    # replaced tf.where with numpy where, using the if condition
    if mask is not None:
        # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
    
        for state, new_state in zip(states, new_states):
            # using numpy where to compare and adjust the shapes
            new_state_shape = np.where(tiled_mask_t, new_state, state)
            return_states.append(new_state_shape)
        states = return_states
        successive_outputs.append(output)
        successive_states.append(states)
    last_output = successive_outputs[-1]
    new_states = successive_states[-1]
    outputs = tf.stack(successive_outputs)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    # Transpose the outputs
    axes = [1, 0] + list(range(2, len(outputs.get_shape())))
    outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, axes)
    last_output._uses_learning_phase = uses_learning_phase
    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

In the corrected code, `numpy.where` is used instead of `tf.where` for the comparison and adjustment of shapes to address the dimension mismatch issue. Additionally, the remaining parts of the function remain unchanged.
