The error message is related to a shape mismatch that occurs when using the `tf.where` function in the `rnn` method. The error specifically states: "Dimension 1 in both shapes must be equal, but are 6 and 3. Shapes are [4,6] and [4,3]." This means that there is a mismatch in dimensions when trying to perform the conditional selection using `tf.where`.

The issue likely arises from the way the dimensions are being handled and broadcasted within the `tf.where` call. The `tf.where` function requires the condition tensor to be the same shape as the two result tensors, but in this case, there is a mismatch.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the dimensions of the condition tensor and the result tensors match properly before passing them to the `tf.where` function. This may involve reshaping or re-broadcasting the tensors as necessary to make their shapes compatible.

Here's the corrected version of the `rnn` method:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Correcting the shape mismatch issue
    if mask is not None:
        # Broadcast mask to match the shape of inputs
        mask = tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1), [1, 1, tf.shape(inputs)[2]])

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

In this corrected code, the `mask` is broadcasted to match the shape of `inputs` using `tf.tile` and `tf.expand_dims` before using it in the `tf.where` function. This ensures that the shapes are compatible and resolves the dimension mismatch issue.
