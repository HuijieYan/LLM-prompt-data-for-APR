```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states, go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None, unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

    Args
        (details ommitted)

    Returns
        A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.

            last_output: the latest output of the rnn, of shape `(samples, ...)`
            outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, time, ...)` where each
                entry `outputs[s, t]` is the output of the step function
                at time `t` for sample `s`.
            new_states: list of tensors, latest states returned by
                the step function, of shape `(samples, ...)`.

    Raises
        ValueError: if input dimension is less than 3.
        ValueError: if `unroll` is `True` but input timestep is not a fixed number.
        ValueError: if `mask` is provided (not `None`) but states is not provided
            (`len(states)` == 0).
