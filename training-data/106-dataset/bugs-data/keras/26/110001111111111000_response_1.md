The given function contains multiple sections of code, hence I will need to fix each section at a time.

Starting with the main function `rnn`, the errors encountered in the test are due to dimension mismatch issues. Let's fix them.

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    if unroll:
        states = initial_states
        successive_states = []
        successive_outputs = []
        input_list = tf.unstack(inputs)
        if go_backwards:
            input_list = input_list[::-1]  # Reverse the list when go_backwards is True
        for inp in input_list:
            output, states = step_function(inp, states)
            successive_outputs.append(output)
            successive_states.append(states)
        # Use list comprehension to iterate over the states and retrieve the last output
        last_output = successive_outputs[-1]
        new_states = successive_states[-1]
        outputs = tf.stack(successive_outputs)
    else:
        states = tuple(initial_states)
        outputs = []
        # Iterate over the time dimension of the tensor
        time = 0
        while time < tf.shape(inputs)[0]:  # Using while loop for iteration
            output, new_states = step_function(inputs[time], states + constants)
            outputs.append(output)
            if time == 0:
                final_states = new_states
            time += 1
            states = new_states
        last_output = outputs[-1]  # The latest output of the rnn
        new_states = final_states  # Latest states returned by the step function
        outputs = tf.stack(outputs)  # Convert the outputs to a tensor
    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

The above `rnn` function is modified by eliminating redundant variables and updating the logic that iterates over the tensor inputs.

There can be more sections for modification based on the complete context and the needs of the developer.
