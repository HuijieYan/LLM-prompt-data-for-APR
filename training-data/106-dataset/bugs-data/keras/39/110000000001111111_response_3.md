The bug in this code results from the iteration over the `values` list. The function attempts to iterate over the `values` list, assuming that the values are tuples, which is not always the case, as demonstrated by the test cases. The bug occurs when the values in the `values` list are not in the expected format, causing the function to throw an error.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to handle cases where the `values` list is not in the expected format. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the values in the `values` list are tuples before attempting to iterate over them. If the values are not in the tuple format, we can convert them to the expected format before performing the iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import sys

def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    if all(isinstance(x, tuple) for x in values):
        for k, v in values:
            if k not in self.sum_values:
                self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                      current - self.seen_so_far]
                self.unique_values.append(k)
            else:
                self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
                self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    else:
        new_values = list(zip(range(len(values)), values))
        for k, v in new_values:
            if k not in self.sum_values:
                self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                      current - self.seen_so_far]
                self.unique_values.append(k)
            else:
                self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
                self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)

    self.seen_so_far = current

    now = time.time()
    # ... (rest of the method remains unchanged)
```

This corrected function includes a check to ensure that the values in the `values` list are in the tuple format before performing the iteration. If the values are not in the tuple format, it converts them to tuples before the iteration.
