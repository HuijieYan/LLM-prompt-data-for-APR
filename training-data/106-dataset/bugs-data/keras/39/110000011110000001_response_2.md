The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of an integer and a NoneType object. This occurs in the `update` method of the `Progbar` class when checking `current < self.target` and `self.target` is `None`.

The potential error location is identified as the comparison `current < self.target` within the `update` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.target` is set as None, and there is no proper handling of this case in the comparison.

To fix this bug, the code needs to check if `self.target` is not None before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                  current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    now = time.time()
    info = ' - %.0fs' % (now - self.start)
    if self.verbose == 1:
        if (self.target is not None) and (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target):
            return

        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition `(self.target is not None)` is added before performing the comparison `current < self.target`, ensuring that the comparison only occurs when `self.target` has a valid value.
