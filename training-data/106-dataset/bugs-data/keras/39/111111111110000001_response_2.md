1. The test case creates an instance of the Progbar class and calls the update method with a target value of None, which is causing the error.

2. Based on the error message, the issue lies within the comparison of the current variable with the target variable, which is None.

3. The error occurs because the update method is attempting to compare the current step value with the target step value, which is None in this case, leading to a TypeError.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the target value is None, which means the total number of steps is unknown. We should avoid making the comparison between the current step and the target step when the target is None.

5. Here's the corrected code for the update method:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                  current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    now = time.time()
    info = ' - %.0fs' % (now - self.start)
    if self.verbose == 1:
        if (self.target is not None and  # Ensure that target is not None
                not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and
                current < self.target):
            return

        # ... (omitted code)

    elif self.verbose == 2:
        if self.target is None or current >= self.target:
            for k in self.unique_values:
                info += ' - %s:' % k
                avg = np.mean(
                    self.sum_values[k][0] / max(1, self.sum_values[k][1]))
                if avg > 1e-3:
                    info += ' %.4f' % avg
                else:
                    info += ' %.4e' % avg
            info += '\n'

            sys.stdout.write(info)
            sys.stdout.flush()

    self.last_update = now
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the target is not None before making the comparison between the current and target steps. If the target is None, we skip the comparison and simply return from the method.
