The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of `time_per_unit` and `eta` values. There are multiple checks on whether `time_per_unit` and `eta` are greater than or equal to certain values, but there's no explicit check for when `time_per_unit` and `eta` are both equal to 0, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because when `current` is equal to `self.target`, the condition `if self.target is not None and current < self.target: return` is executed, which means that the progress bar is not updating correctly when it reaches its target.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `time_per_unit` and `eta` are both equal to 0 and explicitly handle this case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if current == self.target:
        info += f' ETA: N/A'
    elif time_per_unit >= 1:
        info += f' ETA: N/A'
    else:
        if time_per_unit >= 1:
            info += ' %.0fs/step' % time_per_unit
        elif time_per_unit >= 1e-3:
            info += ' %.0fms/step' % (time_per_unit * 1e3)

        # ... rest of the code ...
```
