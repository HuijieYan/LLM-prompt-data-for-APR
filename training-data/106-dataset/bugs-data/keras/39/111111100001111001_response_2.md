The buggy function is failing to update the `sum_values` dictionary correctly. This dictionary maintains the sum of values for each unique key. In the buggy function, there are issues with updating the `sum_values` for each iteration. The unique keys are not being added correctly, and the previous sum and count values are not being updated properly.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the unique keys are added to the `sum_values` correctly.
2. Update the sum and count values for each unique key based on the current iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Progbar(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
        values = values or []
        for value in values:
            k, v = value
            if k not in self.sum_values:
                self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far), current - self.seen_so_far]
                self.unique_values.append(k)
            else:
                self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
                self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
        self.seen_so_far = current

        # ... other code ...
```

In this corrected code, the `values` parameter is iterated correctly to update the `sum_values` dictionary.Each key-value pair is considered individually, and the sum and count values are updated accordingly for each unique key.
