Potential Error Location:
The error might be occurring in the comparison of y_true and y_pred within the K.cast() and K.equal() functions.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the K.max() function is being used to find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true, but this might not be the correct approach for comparing y_true and y_pred.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We should use the K.argmax() function to find the index of the maximum value in y_true and y_pred, and then compare these indices to check for equality.

Corrected Code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
