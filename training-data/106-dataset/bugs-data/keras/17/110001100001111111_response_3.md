Potential error location: The potential error is located in the comparison and casting operations within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect usage of the TensorFlow/Keras functions `K.cast`, `K.equal`, `K.max`, and `K.argmax` for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use the correct TensorFlow/Keras functions for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_17/keras/metrics.py

# corrected function
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, y_pred))
```
