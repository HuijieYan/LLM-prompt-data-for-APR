The potential error location within the problematic function is at the comparison between the max value of y_true and the argmax value of y_pred. The bug occurs because the original function compares the maximum value in y_true with the argmax value in y_pred using the K.max and K.argmax functions. However, these functions are not suitable for this comparison because they do not consider the one-hot encoding format used in the test function. 

To fix the bug, we need to use the K.equal function to compare the actual values of y_true and y_pred instead of comparing their maximum values and argmax values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_17/keras/metrics.py

# Corrected function
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
