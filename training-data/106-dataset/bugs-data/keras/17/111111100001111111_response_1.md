Potential error location: The K.max function is being applied to y_true, which is a 1D tensor. This will return the maximum value of the entire tensor, rather than the maximum value along the specified axis.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because K.max is not being used correctly to find the maximum value along the specified axis in y_true.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use the K.cast and K.equal functions to compare the index of the maximum value along the specified axis in y_true with the index of the maximum value along the same axis in y_pred.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
