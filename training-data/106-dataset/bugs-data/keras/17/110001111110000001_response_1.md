Based on the test case and the error message, the issue lies in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The use of `K.max` and `K.argmax` within the function seems to be incorrect. 

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` line is trying to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, but `y_true` is already an encoded tensor (one-hot encoding) and doesn't contain raw class values to find the maximum from. Similarly, the `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` line is trying to find the index of the maximum value along the last axis of `y_pred`, but `y_pred` is already a softmax output, and taking the argmax directly from a softmax output doesn't make sense for accuracy calculations.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to directly compare the one-hot encoded `y_true` with the softmax output `y_pred` to see if the predicted class matches the true class.

The corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
