The error message is related to the assertion failure between the outputs of `sparse_categorical_accuracy()` and `categorical_accuracy()` functions.

The potential error location within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy()` function is K.max(y_true, axis=-1). 

The bug occurred because in the function `sparse_categorical_accuracy()`, K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is used to get the index of the maximum value along the last axis of y_true, but the correct approach should consider that y_true is a one-hot encoded tensor, so only one value will be 1 and the rest will be 0. The index of the maximum value here represents the class label, but it only works if all the class labels are one-hot encoded.

To fix the bug, the correct approach for this function is to directly compare the one-hot encoded true labels with the predicted probabilities to determine the accuracy. Therefore, we should check for equality between y_true and y_pred after converting the y_pred into one-hot encoded values using K.equal().

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
