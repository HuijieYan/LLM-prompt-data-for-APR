The potential error in the function `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is in the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred`. The Keras function `K.max` is being used to find the maximum value in `y_true` along the last axis, but this is not the correct way to calculate the accuracy for sparse categorical data. 

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly comparing the true values to the predicted values. The `K.max` and `K.argmax` functions are not used correctly to calculate the accuracy.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred` along the last axis to determine the accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
``` 
In the corrected code, `K.argmax` is used to find the indices of the maximum values in both `y_true` and `y_pred` along the last axis. Then the `K.equal` function is used to compare these indices to calculate the accuracy.
