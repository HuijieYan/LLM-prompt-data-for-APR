The potential error in the provided function is the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1), which is not the correct way to find the maximum value in y_true.

The bug occurs because K.max function is not suitable for finding the maximum value index along a specified axis in y_true, which is needed for comparison with the argmax of y_pred.

To fix this bug, we can use K.argmax function to find the indices of the maximum values in y_true and y_pred, and then compare these indices to calculate the accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    accuracy = K.cast(K.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), K.floatx())
    return accuracy
```
