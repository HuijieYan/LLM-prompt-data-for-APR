The buggy function `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is trying to calculate the accuracy of the predictions `y_pred` compared to the true labels `y_true`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be fixed.

The potential error location is in the calculation of the accuracy using the Keras backend functions. The `K.argmax` function should be used to find the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, and then compare it with the true labels `y_true` using `K.equal` to get the accuracy.

The bug occurred because the comparison between `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` and `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` was not properly cast to the appropriate data type.

To fix this bug, you can use the following corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_labels = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(true_labels, pred_labels), tf.float32))
    return accuracy
```

In this corrected function, `tf.argmax` is used to find the index of the maximum value in both `y_true` and `y_pred`. Then, `tf.equal` is used to check for equality between the true and predicted labels, and `tf.cast` is used to cast the result to `tf.float32`. Finally, `tf.reduce_mean` is used to calculate the accuracy.
