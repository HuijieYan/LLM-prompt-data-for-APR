Potential Error:
The bug is likely in the line `K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx()))`. This line is trying to compare the maximum value in `y_true` with the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, but it is not implemented correctly.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because `K.equal` is comparing two tensors of different shapes. The shape of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` will be different from the shape of `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)`.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to use the correct functions to compare the sparse categorical accuracy. To fix the bug, we need to compare the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred` directly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
