The test case is comparing the output of `sparse_categorical_accuracy` with the output of `categorical_accuracy` using `assert np.allclose()`. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing, showing the output of both functions.

The potential error location in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value in `y_true`, which is an incorrectly formatted tensor for the task. Additionally, the return statement should use `K.mean()` instead of `K.cast()` because we want to calculate the mean accuracy across all predictions.

The bug occurred because the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function was not computing the accuracy correctly. The comparison between the maximum value in `y_true` and the argmax of `y_pred` was not the correct approach. Instead, we want to compare the index of the highest true value with the index of the highest predicted value.

To fix the bug, we should use `K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1))` to compare the indices of the highest true value and the highest predicted value. Additionally, we should use `K.mean()` to calculate the mean accuracy across all predictions.

Fixed code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)))
```
