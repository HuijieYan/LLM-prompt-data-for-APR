The test function `test_sparse_categorical_accuracy_correctness` is comparing the output of `metrics.sparse_categorical_accuracy` with `metrics.categorical_accuracy`. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert np.allclose(K.eval(sparse_categorical_acc), K.eval(categorical_acc))` is failing. This means that the sparse_categorical_accuracy is not producing the expected result when compared to categorical_accuracy.

The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is in the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This function is meant to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, but it is not handling sparse categorical accuracy correctly.

The bug occurs because the expression `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is expected to return a tensor that represents the true class labels for each sample, but it doesn't. Instead, it just returns the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, which is not meaningful for sparse categorical accuracy calculation.

To fix the bug, we need to use `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` to obtain the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of `y_true`, and then compare these indices with the predicted class labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    predicted_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    matches = K.cast(K.equal(true_labels, predicted_labels), K.floatx())
    return K.mean(matches)
```

With this correction, the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function will return the correct accuracy measure for sparse categorical data, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
