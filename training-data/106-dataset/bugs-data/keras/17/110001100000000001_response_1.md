Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. 

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be in the comparison of the maximum value of y_true with the argmax of y_pred. The K.max function may not be suitable for this comparison.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using K.max, we can directly compare the indices of y_true and y_pred to calculate the accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
