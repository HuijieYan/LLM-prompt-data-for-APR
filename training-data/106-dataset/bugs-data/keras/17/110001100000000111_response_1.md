# Corrected function source code

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_17/keras/metrics.py

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```

Explanation:
The original function has an error because it compares the max of y_true with the argmax of y_pred, which is incorrect. It should compare the argmax of y_true with the argmax of y_pred to calculate the categorical accuracy.

To fix the error, we need to compare the argmax of y_true with the argmax of y_pred and then cast the result to the appropriate data type. This corrected code does that and should resolve the issue.
