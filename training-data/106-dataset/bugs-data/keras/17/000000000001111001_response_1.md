The buggy function `sparse_categorical_accuracy` appears to be using the Keras backend functions, but it is not clear which backend (e.g., TensorFlow, Theano) is being used. The error seems to stem from the `K.max` and `K.argmax` functions, which are not being used correctly.

The `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` attempts to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, which has a shape of (6,). However, `K.max` is used incorrectly as it is expecting a tensor with at least 1 dimension greater than 1.

Similarly, `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` tries to find the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of `y_pred`, which has a shape of (6, 7). The usage of `K.argmax` is correct, but the comparison is not being carried out properly.

To fix this function, we need to use `K.argmax` to find the indices of the maximum values of `y_true` and then compare it with the indices of the maximum values of `y_pred`. Additionally, we should cast the result to `K.floatx()` to ensure that the result has the correct data type.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    accuracy = K.cast(K.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), K.floatx())
    return accuracy
```
