The code is trying to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy, but it seems to be inaccurate. 

Looking at the function `sparse_categorical_accuracy`, the bug appears to be with the comparison operation `K.equal`. The bug lies in comparing `y_true` with `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` using `K.equal`. The problem is that `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` returns the maximum value along the last dimension, but this value may not be the same as the index of the maximum value in `y_true` which is returned by `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function in such a way that it correctly computes the sparse categorical accuracy.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```

This updated implementation compares the index of the maximum value in `y_true` with the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, which is the correct approach for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.
