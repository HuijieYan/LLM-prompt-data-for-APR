Potential Error Location: The problem is with the `K.cast` function and how it's being used.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the `K.cast` function is being used incorrectly. It is attempting to cast the result of the `K.equal` function, instead of the arguments passed to it.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to correct the usage of the `K.cast` function to ensure that it correctly casts the arguments passed to it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'int32')),
                  K.floatx())
```
