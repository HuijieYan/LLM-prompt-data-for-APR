The error occurs in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug is likely due to the incorrect use of the K.equal and casting operations. The incorrect implementation is comparing the maximum value of `y_true` with the argmax of `y_pred` directly, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to compare the argmax of `y_true` with the argmax of `y_pred`. Additionally, we need to cast the result to the appropriate data type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```

This corrected function first finds the argmax of both `y_true` and `y_pred` and then compares them using `K.equal`, followed by casting the result to the appropriate data type.
