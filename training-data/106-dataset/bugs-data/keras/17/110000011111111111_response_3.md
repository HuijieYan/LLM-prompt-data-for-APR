The potential error location within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is in the comparison of `y_true` and `y_pred`.

The bug in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is not properly calculating the accuracy. It should be calculating the accuracy of the predicted values `y_pred` and the true values `y_true`. The current implementation doesn't handle the transformation of `y_true` into one-hot encoded values which is essential for categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to first convert `y_true` into one-hot encoded values using `K.one_hot` and then calculate the accuracy by comparing the one-hot encoded `y_true` with `y_pred`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(K.flatten(y_true), 'int64')
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'int64')
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
