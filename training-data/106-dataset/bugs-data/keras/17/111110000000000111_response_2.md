Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the line where K.cast is used to cast the result of K.equal to K.floatx().

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the K.equal function returns a boolean tensor, and then K.cast is used to cast it to the same data type as K.floatx(). This is not the correct way to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: Instead of using K.equal and K.cast, we can use K.mean to calculate the accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())))
```
