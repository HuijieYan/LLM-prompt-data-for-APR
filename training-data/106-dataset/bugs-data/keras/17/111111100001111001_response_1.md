Potential Error Location: The potential error in the provided function lies in the use of K.max and K.argmax functions, as the inputs provided are TensorFlow Variables of shape (6,) and (6, 7) respectively.

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function does not handle the input tensors correctly. It attempts to use K.max and K.argmax directly on the input tensors, which might lead to shape incompatibility issues and incorrect operations.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use TensorFlow's built-in functions for calculating sparse categorical accuracy, while taking into account the shape of the input tensors.

Corrected Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred), tf.float32)
```
