Potential error location: The issue may be with the usage of the `K.max` function on `y_true`, which has a shape of (6,) and is expected to return the maximum value along axis -1, which does not exist for this shape.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `K.max` function is being used incorrectly on `y_true`, and it's not possible to find the maximum value along axis -1 for a tensor with the shape (6,).

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use `K.argmax` on `y_true` to find the index of the maximum value instead of using `K.max`.
2. Change the approach to compare the indexes directly instead of comparing the maximum values.
3. Check if the dimensions of `y_true` and `y_pred` are compatible for comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
