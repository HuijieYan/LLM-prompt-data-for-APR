Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the comparison between y_true and y_pred using K.max and K.argmax. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison between y_true and y_pred is not being performed correctly. The K.max function is used to find the maximum value along a specified axis, but it is being used to compare with y_true, which is incorrect. Similarly, the K.argmax function is used to find the index of the maximum value along a specified axis, but it is being used with y_pred in a comparison, which is also incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. We need to compare the indices of the maximum values in y_true and y_pred, rather than the values themselves.
2. Use K.equal to compare the indices of the maximum values in y_true and y_pred.

Corrected code:
```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
