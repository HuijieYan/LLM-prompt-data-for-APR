The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function lies in the use of `K.max` and `K.equal`. These functions are used to calculate the accuracy for sparse categorical data, but they are not being applied correctly. This is causing the test case to fail.

It seems like the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is intended to compare the indices of the maximum values of `y_true` and `y_pred`. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect, resulting in the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly compare the indices of the maximum values of `y_true` and `y_pred`. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the numpy function `argmax` to find the indices of the maximum values and then compare these indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# corrected function
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = np.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return np.mean(true_indices == pred_indices)
```

This should resolve the issue and make the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function work as intended. Now, when the test case is executed, it should not result in an assertion error.
