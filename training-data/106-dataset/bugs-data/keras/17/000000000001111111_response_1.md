The potential error in the provided function is the use of `K.max` and `K.argmax` functions inside the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The error occurs because these functions are being used on tensors directly, but they should be used through Keras backend functions.

The buggy function is attempting to directly use operations from the Keras backend (K) on the input tensors. However, this is incorrect because the Keras backend functions should be used instead. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to use Keras backend functions properly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_labels, pred_labels), K.floatx())
```
