The error occurs in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug is likely due to incorrect comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` in the function. The function should return the mean accuracy instead of just accuracy. 

The bug occurrs due to the fact that K.max and K.argmax were used directly instead of their average values over the axis=-1.

To fix the bug, we should take the average of the values of K.max and K.argmax before making the equality comparison. Additionally, we should take the mean of the resulting tensor.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1),
                                K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                        K.floatx()))
```
