The potential error in the provided `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is in the calculation of sparse categorical accuracy, which is incorrect due to the comparison between y_true and y_pred. The error message from the test function indicates that the calculated sparse categorical accuracy does not match the expected categorical accuracy.

The bug occurs because the function compares the maximum value in `y_true` to the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, which is incorrect for calculating sparse categorical accuracy. The correct approach should involve comparing the index of the maximum value in `y_true` to the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`.

To fix the bug, the corrected function for `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is provided below:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
In the corrected function, `K.argmax` is used to get the index of the maximum value for both `y_true` and `y_pred`. Then, the comparison is performed between these two indices, and the result is cast to the appropriate datatype using `K.cast`.

By using the corrected function, the test case should produce the expected result and not raise an assertion error.
