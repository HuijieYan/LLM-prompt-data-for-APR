The error message indicates that the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is returning incorrect results, leading to a failed assertion in the test. 

The potential error lies in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically in how it calculates the accuracy between `y_true` and `y_pred`. Currently, the function uses K.max to find the maximum value in `y_true` and then compares it with the argmax of `y_pred`. This comparison is incorrect and may be the cause of the failed test.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of `sparse_categorical_accuracy` does not correctly calculate the accuracy of sparse categorical data. It compares the max value of `y_true` with the argmax of `y_pred`, which does not reflect the true accuracy.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to check if the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred` are equal, instead of comparing the actual values.

The corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_labels, pred_labels), K.floatx())
```
