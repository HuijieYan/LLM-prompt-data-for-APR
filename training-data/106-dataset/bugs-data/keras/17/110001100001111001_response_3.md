The potential error location in the problematic function is the use of the `K.max` function on `y_true`, which is a tensor of shape (6,) representing the true labels. The `K.max` function is intended for finding the maximum value in a tensor along a specified axis, but in this context, it is being used to compare the true labels against the predicted labels.

The bug occurs because `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is not the correct way to compare the true labels with the predicted labels.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, and then cast the result to the appropriate data type. Additionally, it's important to use `K.equal` for element-wise comparison rather than comparing the entire array at once.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    predicted_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_labels, predicted_labels), K.floatx())
```

With this corrected function, we extract the indices of the maximum values for both `y_true` and `y_pred`, compare them element-wise, and cast the result to the appropriate data type.
