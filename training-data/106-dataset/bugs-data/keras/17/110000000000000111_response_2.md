Potential error location:
The potential error is occurring in the use of K.cast to convert the result of K.equal to K.floatx().

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because K.equal is returning a boolean tensor, and K.cast is being used to convert it to K.floatx(), but the wrong arguments are being passed to K.cast. Additionally, the use of K.max and K.argmax may also be incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use K.cast to convert the boolean tensor returned by K.equal to float32.
2. Check the proper usage of K.max and K.argmax to ensure the correct comparison is being made.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
