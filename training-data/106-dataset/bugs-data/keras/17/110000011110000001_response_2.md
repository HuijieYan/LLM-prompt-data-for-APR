The `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is supposed to calculate the accuracy of sparse categorical data. The error message from the test function indicates that the calculated accuracy does not match the expected accuracy.

The issue lies in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug occurs because of incorrect use of the Keras backend functions. In particular, the use of `K.max` and `K.equal` is incorrect in this context.

To fix the bug, the corrected function should compute the accuracy correctly by comparing the indices of the maximum values of the true and predicted tensors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = tf.nn.softmax(y_pred)
    y_pred = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.int64)
    return tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred), tf.float32)
```
