The potential error in the provided function is that it's not handling the input parameters correctly and is not using the correct functions from the Keras backend (assuming K is the Keras backend). The function is trying to directly use the Keras backend functions without importing the Keras backend or wrapping the code inside a Keras custom function.

The error occurs because the function is trying to directly use the Keras backend functions without the necessary setup.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be wrapped inside a Keras custom function and the Keras backend functions need to be imported.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'float32')), 'float32')
```
