The bug is located in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The function is designed to calculate the accuracy of the predictions by computing whether the highest value in the true values matches the index of the maximum value in the predicted values along the last dimension (axis=-1).

The bug occurs because the equality comparison is not correctly being cast to the correct data type. Additionally, the use of K.max and K.argmax has resulted in incorrect behavior. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly perform the comparison between the true and predicted values and cast the comparison result to the correct data type.

Here's the corrected `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int64')
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'int64')), K.floatx())
```
