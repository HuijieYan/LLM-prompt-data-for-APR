Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the line `K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx())`. This line seems to be attempting to calculate the accuracy of the predictions but has some issues.

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. The K.max function is being used on y_true, which is not the correct approach for calculating accuracy.
2. The use of K.cast seems to be incorrect as well, as it's being used to convert the result of K.equal to K.floatx when that's not necessary.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use K.equal to compare y_true and y_pred elements to get a boolean tensor.
2. Then, use K.cast to convert the boolean tensor to a float32 or float64 tensor, as required.

Corrected Code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)), K.floatx()))
```
