The potential error location within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This will return a single maximum value from the tensor `y_true`, which is not the desired behavior for finding the maximum value along the last axis of a tensor. 

The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly compute the accuracy for sparse categorical data. It fails to convert the input `y_true` into one-hot encoded dense labels, and uses incorrect logic to compare the predictions (`y_pred`) with the true labels (`y_true`).

To fix the bug, we should use `K.one_hot` to convert `y_true` into one-hot encoded dense labels and then compare it with the predictions using `K.equal`. 

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, 'int64')
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred), 'int64')
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
