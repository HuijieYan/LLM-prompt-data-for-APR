The test case is comparing the results of `sparse_categorical_accuracy()` and `categorical_accuracy()`. The error message indicates that the values returned by the two functions are not close, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy()` function is the incorrect usage of `K.equal()` and `K.cast()`, which may not be handling the input tensors correctly.

The bug is occurring because `K.equal()` and `K.cast()` are not applied properly to compare the two tensors and cast the result to the correct data type.

To fix the bug, the `sparse_categorical_accuracy()` function should correctly handle the input tensors and cast the result to the correct data type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_label = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_label = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    matches = K.cast(K.equal(true_label, pred_label), K.floatx())
    accuracy = K.mean(matches)
    return accuracy
```
