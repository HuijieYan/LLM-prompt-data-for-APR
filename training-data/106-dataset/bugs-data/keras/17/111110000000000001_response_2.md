Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the comparison between y_true and y_pred. The equality check and casting to the same type might not be correctly implemented.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The `K.equal` function is used to check for equality between `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` and `K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())`. However, the casting to the same type might not be functioning as expected.
2. The use of `K.floatx()` might not be appropriate for the casting operation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use TensorFlow's built-in function for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.
2. Use TensorFlow's eager execution to directly calculate the accuracy without involving casting and comparison.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected function
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.metrics.sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred)
```
