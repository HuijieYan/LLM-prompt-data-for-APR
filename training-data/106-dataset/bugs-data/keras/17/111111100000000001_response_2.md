Potential error:
The error might occur due to the incorrect comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function.

Reason for the bug:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect calculation of accuracy using Keras backend functions. The comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors needs to be improved to accurately calculate sparse categorical accuracy.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use K.equal to compare the indices of `y_true` and `y_pred` directly.
2. Use K.mean to calculate the mean accuracy across all samples in the batch.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)))
```
This corrected function compares the indices of `y_true` and `y_pred` to calculate the accuracy and then uses K.mean to calculate the mean accuracy across all samples in the batch.
