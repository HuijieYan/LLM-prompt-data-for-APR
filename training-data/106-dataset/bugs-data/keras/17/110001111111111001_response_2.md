The error message shows an AssertionError because the expected and actual values are not close. The issue seems to be in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function, which is not providing the expected output.

The potential error location is in the calculation of `sparse_categorical_acc` inside the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function.

The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of `sparse_categorical_acc`. The function should calculate the accuracy between `y_true` and `y_pred` using the `K.equal` and `K.argmax` functions.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function to correctly calculate the sparse categorical accuracy as follows:

```python
from keras import backend as K
import numpy as np

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, y_pred))
```

This corrected implementation retrieves the indices of maximum values along the last axis, compares them, and calculates the mean accuracy, which is the expected behavior for sparse categorical accuracy.
