Potential error location: 
The potential error lies within the use of K.max and K.equal functions. The current implementation is not effectively comparing the y_true and y_pred values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The K.max function is being used in a way that does not effectively compare the values of y_true and y_pred. Additionally, the use of K.equal is not appropriate for the comparison of the maximum values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use numpy functions to calculate the maximum values and compare them.
2. Modify the comparison logic to accurately compare the values of y_true and y_pred.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_max = np.amax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_argmax = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return np.cast(true_max, dtype=np.float32) == np.cast(pred_argmax, dtype=np.float32)
```
