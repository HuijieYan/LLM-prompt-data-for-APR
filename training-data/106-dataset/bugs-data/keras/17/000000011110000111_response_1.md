The issue seems to be in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function where it does not correctly calculate the accuracy. The error message indicates that the comparison between the sparse categorical accuracy and categorical accuracy does not yield the expected results, resulting in an assertion error in the test.

The potential error location is in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function's return statement. The use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` and `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)` might not correctly calculate the accuracy, leading to incorrect results.

The bug occurred because the function did not correctly calculate the sparse categorical accuracy. The original code tried to compare the maximum value in `y_true` with the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, but this comparison may not correctly represent the accuracy.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use appropriate functions to calculate the accuracy:
- First, convert `y_true` to its one-hot encoded equivalent using `K.one_hot()` function.
- Then, calculate the accuracy using the one-hot encoded `y_true` and `y_pred` using `K.equal()` and `K.mean()` functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, y_pred))
```
