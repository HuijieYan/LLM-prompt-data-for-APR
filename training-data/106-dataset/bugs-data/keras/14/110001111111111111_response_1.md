The error is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function due to the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` which is causing the shapes to be mismatched and leading to the error. The function `K.max()` is reducing the dimension of `y_true` which is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to handle the different shapes of `y_true`. We should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1).

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Squeeze y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The fix involves checking the shape of `y_true` and squeezing it if necessary before using it in the `in_top_k` function. This will ensure that the function can handle different shapes of `y_true` correctly.
