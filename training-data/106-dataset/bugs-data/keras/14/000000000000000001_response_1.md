Potential error location: 
The error may be in the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` part of the code, which is supposed to find the maximum value along the last axis of the `y_true` tensor, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented.

Reason for the bug:
The `K.max()` function is being used incorrectly. It is intended to find the maximum value, but it is not used in a way that is consistent with its intended purpose.

Possible approach to fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing the bug is to use the `tf.math.top_k` function to calculate the top k values and indices, and then check if the true index is within those top k indices.

Corrected code:
```
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    top_k_values, top_k_indices = tf.math.top_k(y_pred, k)
    true_index = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(tf.dtypes.cast(tf.math.reduce_any(tf.equal(top_k_indices, true_index[:, tf.newaxis]), axis=-1), dtype='float32'))
```
