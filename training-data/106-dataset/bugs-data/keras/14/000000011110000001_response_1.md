The error message indicates that the shape of the inputs is not what the 'in_top_k' function expects. The error message specifically mentions that the input shapes are [2, 3], [], [], and it states that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The bug occurs because the 'in_top_k' function expects the target values to have the shape [batch_size, num_classes] and the predictions to have the shape [batch_size, num_classes]. However, based on the error message, it seems that the input shapes are [2, 3] for predictions and [], which is incorrect. The target values must be transformed into one-hot encoded format or categorical format before being used with the 'in_top_k' function.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the target values ('y_true') into the expected format before using the 'in_top_k' function. One approach is to use the K.one_hot function to convert 'y_true' into the one-hot encoded format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.one_hot(K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1])
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we first convert 'y_true' into the one-hot encoded format using the K.one_hot function. Then, we use the 'in_top_k' function with the transformed 'y_true' to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy.
