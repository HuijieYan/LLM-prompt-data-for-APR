The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the input tensors to the `in_top_k` function. Specifically, the error mentions "Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0" and provides the input shapes as [2,3], [], []. This suggests that the shapes of the input tensors to the `in_top_k` function are not compatible with its requirements.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, where `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` returns the maximum value along axis -1, which results in a tensor with a different shape than expected by `in_top_k` function.

The bug occurs because the shape of the tensor returned by `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is not properly handled before being passed to the `in_top_k` function. The shape of the tensor should be modified to match the expected input shape of the `in_top_k` function.

To fix the bug, the shape of the tensor returned by `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` should be modified to ensure it has the appropriate shape and compatibility with the `in_top_k` function. This can be achieved by using `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)` instead of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
