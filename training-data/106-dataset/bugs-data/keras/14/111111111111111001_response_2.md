The error message indicates a problem with the shape of the input tensors in the `in_top_k` operation. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the `y_true` tensor is being manipulated or processed in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` expression is causing issues with the shape of the tensor, resulting in an error during the execution of the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` expression should be replaced with `y_true`, as the `in_top_k` function expects a one-dimensional tensor (`y_true`) to perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
