The potential error in the function is likely due to the use of TensorFlow's `K.max` function, which is meant to calculate the maximum value along a certain axis. However, the y_true variable is expected to be a one-hot encoded categorical variable, and applying K.max to this variable may not produce the desired result.

To fix this issue, we should change the buggy function to use `K.argmax` instead of `K.max` in order to obtain the indices of the maximum value along the last axis of y_true. We will then use these indices as the ground truth labels for the `K.in_top_k` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
