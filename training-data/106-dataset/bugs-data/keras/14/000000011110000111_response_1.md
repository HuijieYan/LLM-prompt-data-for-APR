The error message indicates that there is an issue with the input shapes in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error is due to the assumption about the shape of `y_true`, which is causing the incorrect output. The function is not handling the different shapes of `y_true` correctly, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function needs to be modified to handle the different shapes of `y_true` appropriately. It should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable, before processing it further.

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze y_true if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code:
- We handle the different shapes of `y_true` by using `K.squeeze` to remove the extra dimension if the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`.
- Then, we proceed with computing the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` using the corrected `y_true`.

With these changes, the function should handle the different shapes of `y_true` correctly and avoid the error identified in the test case.
