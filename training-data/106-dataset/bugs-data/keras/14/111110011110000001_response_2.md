The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors being used in the `in_top_k` function. The error specifically mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' with input shapes: [2,3], [], []. This means that the shape of the input tensors does not match the expected format.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.max(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

The bug occurs because the `in_top_k` function expects the input tensors to be in the format of (batch_size, num_classes) for `predictions` and (batch_size, ) for `targets`. However, the shape of the `y_true` tensor passed to the `in_top_k` function is incorrect, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the shape of the input tensors passed to the `in_top_k` function matches the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k))
```

The change made in the corrected code is that instead of taking the maximum value of `y_true` along the specified axis, we take the argmax (index of the maximum value) to ensure that the shape of the input tensor matches the expected format of (batch_size, ). Additionally, I removed the `axis=-1` argument from the `K.mean` function, as it is not necessary. The corrected implementation should resolve the issue and produce the expected results.
