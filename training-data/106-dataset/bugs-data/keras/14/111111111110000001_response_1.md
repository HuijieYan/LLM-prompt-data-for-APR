The error message is indicating that there is a mismatch in the shape of the input tensors. The problem lies in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function, specifically when computing `K.in_top_k`. This function is used to compute the top-k categorical accuracy, but the error message indicates a shape mismatch issue.

The bug is occurring because of the mismatch in the shapes of the input tensors `y_true` and `y_pred`. The `K.in_top_k` function expects the same shape for both `predictions` and `targets`. However, in the provided code, there is a shape mismatch because the shape of `y_true` and `y_pred` are different. 

To fix this bug, we need to reshape the `y_true` tensor to match the shape of the `y_pred` tensor. This can be done using the `K.argmax` function to convert `y_true` to a one-hot representation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.one_hot(K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1])
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true, k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, `K.one_hot` is used to convert `y_true` into a one-hot representation with the same shape as `y_pred`, ensuring that they have the same shape and resolving the previous shape mismatch error.
