The `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function seems to be working with Tensorflow's operations, specifically the `in_top_k` operation. The error message indicates a problem with the shape of the input. It mentions that the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0 for the 'in_top_k/InTopKV2' operation.

The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is caused by the incorrect usage of the `in_top_k` operation. The `in_top_k` expects the shape of `targets` to be rank 1, but in the code, `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` returns the maximum value along the last dimension, resulting in a scalar.

To fix this bug, we can modify the line where the `in_top_k` function is called to ensure that the shape of the `targets` parameter is rank 1.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    top_k = K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k)
    return K.mean(top_k, axis=-1)
```

In this corrected function, `K.argmax` is used to obtain the indices of the maximum values in `y_true`, ensuring that the shape of the `targets` parameter for the `in_top_k` function is rank 1. Additionally, the result of `K.in_top_k` is stored in a variable `top_k`, and then the mean of `top_k` is calculated and returned.
