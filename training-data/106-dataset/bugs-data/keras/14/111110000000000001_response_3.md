Potential error location: The potential error may be in the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1), as it is not correctly calculating the maximum values over the specified axis.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because K.max(y_true, axis=-1) is not being used correctly to calculate the maximum values over the specified axis. This is leading to incorrect comparisons and inaccurate results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use the K.argmax function to find the indices of the maximum values in y_true, and then use K.in_top_k with these indices to calculate the top k categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k))
```
