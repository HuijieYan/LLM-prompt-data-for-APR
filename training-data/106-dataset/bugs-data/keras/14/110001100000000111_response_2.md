The bug seems to be in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes the shape of `y_true` to be (num_samples, 1) and always reduces the last dimension, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, -1)  # Squeeze if the shape is (num_samples, 1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
