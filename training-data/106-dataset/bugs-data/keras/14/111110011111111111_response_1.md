The error occurred because the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` uses the `K.max` function with the `axis` parameter, which is causing shape mismatch and leading to an InvalidArgumentError.

To fix the bug, we need to check the shape of `y_true` and if it has a second dimension, then we should squeeze it to ensure that it has the correct shape before using it in the `K.max` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze if the shape contains an additional dimension
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the shape of `y_true` and should no longer produce the InvalidArgumentError.
