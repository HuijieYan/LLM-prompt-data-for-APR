The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is due to the incorrect use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This is leading to wrong results because it's comparing the indices of the maximum value between `y_pred` and `y_true`, which is not the correct way to calculate top-k accuracy for categorical data.

To fix this bug, instead of comparing the maximum indices of `y_true`, we should directly use `y_true` for comparison.

Below is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return tf.keras.metrics.top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k)
```

This function uses `tf.keras.metrics.top_k_categorical_accuracy` to calculate the top-k categorical accuracy, ensuring correct behavior and accuracy calculation.
