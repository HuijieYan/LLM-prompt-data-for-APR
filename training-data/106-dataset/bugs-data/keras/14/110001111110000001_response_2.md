The error message indicates that there is a problem with the shape of the input tensors in the `in_top_k` function. The input shapes are determined as `[2,3], [], []`, where the empty array `[]` is the issue. This suggests that there is a mismatch between the shapes of `y_pred` and `y_true`.

The problematic function is `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`, and the issue lies in the computation of the inputs for the `in_top_k` function. The mismatch in input shapes causes the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the shapes of `y_pred` and `y_true` match appropriately before passing them to `in_top_k`.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
