The potential error in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is trying to find the maximum value of `y_true` along axis=-1, which is not a valid operation when `y_true` is a tensor with a shape of (2,). This tensor does not have an axis=-1.

The function is trying to use `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` to find the maximum value of `y_true`, but `y_true` does not have an axis=-1. Additionally, `K.cast` is also being used on `y_true`, which is unnecessary.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `K.max` and `K.cast` operations from the function and directly compare the indices of the top k values in `y_pred` with the indices of the top k values in `y_true`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred_top_k = K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k)
    return K.mean(y_pred_top_k, axis=-1)
```
