The bug appears to be in the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The error message indicates that the `loss` value is a 'nan' (not a number) instead of 0, which suggests that there is an issue with the calculation of the loss.

Potential error location: The issue may be related to how the mask and weights are handled in the `weighted` function. Specifically, the calculations involving the `score_array` and the provided `weights` and `mask` are likely causing the problem.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. It seems that the handling of the mask and weights is not being done correctly, resulting in an incorrect loss value.
2. Additionally, there may be a problem with how the masking is applied to the `score_array`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify that the mask and weights are being applied to the `score_array` correctly, and that the calculations involving them are valid.
2. Ensure that the dimensions and shapes of the `score_array`, weights, and mask are compatible for the operations being performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)  # the loss per batch should be proportional to the number of unmasked samples.

        if weights is not None:
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array, axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
            
        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
