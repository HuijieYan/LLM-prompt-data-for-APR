The potential error in the provided function is in the calculation of `score_array` and its manipulation with the mask and weights. 

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the dimensions of the score_array and the weights, and also does not properly handle the case when the mask is provided. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the dimensions of score_array and weights, and also adjust the manipulation of score_array when the mask is provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array = K.tf.where(mask, score_array, K.zeros_like(score_array))

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array = K.tf.multiply(score_array, K.cast(weights, K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
