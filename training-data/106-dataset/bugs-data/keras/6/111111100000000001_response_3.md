Potential error location: 

The `weighted_masked_objective` function is returning the `weighted` function as the output, which is intended to wrap the original objective function `fn` and add support for masking and sample-weighting. However, this wrapping is not done correctly, as instead of returning a new function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`, the `weighted_masked_objective` is simply returning the `weighted` function.

Reasons behind the bug:

The `weighted_masked_objective` function is not correctly wrapping the original objective function `fn` to support sample-weighting and masking.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we should modify the `weighted_masked_objective` function to actually wrap the original objective function `fn` by returning a new function with the required signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`. This new function should include the logic to calculate the objective using sample-weighting and masking.

Corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Wraps an objective function to support masking and sample-weighting.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    """
    if fn is None:
        return None
