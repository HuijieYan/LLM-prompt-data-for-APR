The bug in the provided code is likely causing the loss value to become NaN instead of 0 as expected in the test function. The bug is likely in the `weighted` function within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. This can be due to various reasons such as mishandling of the mask or weights, or incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the mask and weights are handled properly. Additionally, check the division operations to avoid potential division by zero errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.maximum(K.mean(mask), K.epsilon())

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights / K.maximum(K.mean(K.abs(weights)), K.epsilon())

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```

In this corrected code, the division operations for handling the mask and weights have been modified to avoid potential division by zero errors. Additionally, K.epsilon() is used to add a small constant to avoid division by zero.
