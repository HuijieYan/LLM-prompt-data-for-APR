The error message from the test function indicates that the loss value is 'nan' instead of 0, which is the expected value. This suggests that there is an issue with the loss calculation, likely caused by the buggy function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the 'score_array'. There may be an issue with how the score array is computed, especially when dealing with sample-weighting and masking.

The bug occurs because the 'score_array' is not being properly handled when applying the mask and sample weighting. This results in incorrect loss calculations, leading to the 'nan' value.

One approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic for applying the mask and sample weighting to ensure that the 'score_array' is appropriately adjusted based on these factors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # apply the mask to the score_array
            score_array *= mask 

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights

        # ignore samples with weight 0
        score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
