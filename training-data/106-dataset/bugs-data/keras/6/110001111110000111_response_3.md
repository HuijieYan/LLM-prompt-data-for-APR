The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the loss. The error message indicates that the calculated loss is resulting in a `nan` (not a number) value instead of the expected 0.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the combination of masking and sample-weighting in the `weighted_masked_objective` function. It is possible that the application of both masking and sample-weighting is leading to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior, resulting in the loss being calculated as a `nan`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the implementation of the `weighted_masked_objective` function and ensure that the handling of masking and sample-weighting is correctly applied without leading to numerical issues. Additionally, checking the calculation of the loss and its interaction with the masking and sample-weighting process is crucial to address the bug.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # Score calculation
        score = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        # Applying mask
        if mask is not None:
            score *= mask
            score /= K.mean(mask)

        # Application of sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score *= weights
            score /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
            
        return K.mean(score)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the handling of masking and sample weighting is more explicit and streamlined, which reduces the likelihood of numerical issues leading to `nan` values.
