1. The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` is checking if the loss calculated by the model is 0 when the input and output arrays are both zeros.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of `score_array` and its manipulation with the mask and weights.

3. The error message indicates that the loss calculated is not equal to 0, and it's a `nan` value. This suggests that there is an issue with how the loss is being calculated or manipulated within the function `weighted_masked_objective`.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the operations on the `score_array` with the mask and weights are properly handled, and that the data types are consistent throughout the calculations. Additionally, the calculations for the loss and its manipulation should be validated against simple test cases, such as the one provided.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array = K.mean(score_array * mask, axis=-1)  # Updated this line
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))  # Updated this line

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            if K.ndim(weights) < K.ndim(score_array):
                weights = K.mean(weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array * weights, axis=-1)  # Updated this line
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))  # Updated this line
        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```

The corrections involve updating the operations on the `score_array` with the mask and weights, ensuring the shapes and data types are handled properly. These changes aim to fix the bug causing the loss to be calculated as `nan`.
