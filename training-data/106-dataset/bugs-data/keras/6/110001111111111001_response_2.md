Potential error location: The issue seems to be within the `weighted_masked_objective` function, particularly in the calculation of the `score_array` and the application of masking and sample weighting.

Reason for the bug: The bug might be due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the loss.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the mask and weights are applied correctly to the `score_array`.
2. Ensure that the dimensions and shapes of the `score_array`, mask, and weights are compatible for proper calculation.
3. Properly handle the situation where the weights are zero to avoid division by zero.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= K.cast(mask, K.floatx())  # Apply mask directly to score_array

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights  # Multiply score_array by weights
            score_array /= K.mean(weights)  # Normalize by the mean of weights

        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
