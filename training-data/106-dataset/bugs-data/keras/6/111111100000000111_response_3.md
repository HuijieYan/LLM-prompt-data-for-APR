The potential error location in the provided code is the `weighted_masked_objective` function, where the `weighted` function is nested.

The bug in the code is that the `weighted` function is defined inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function, but it is not being returned by the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The `weighted` function should be returned by the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

To fix the bug, the `weighted` function should be returned by the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None
    
    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # ... (unchanged code) ...
    return weighted
```
