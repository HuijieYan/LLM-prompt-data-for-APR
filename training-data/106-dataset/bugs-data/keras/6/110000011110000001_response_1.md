Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the calculation of the loss in the `weighted` function defined in the `weighted_masked_objective` method.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the calculation of the loss in the `weighted` function does not handle the case when the mask or weights are all zeros correctly, leading to a division by zero or other invalid operations. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the weights or mask are all zeros and handle this case appropriately to avoid invalid operations.
2. Check for the presence of weights or mask before performing operations that involve them.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.
