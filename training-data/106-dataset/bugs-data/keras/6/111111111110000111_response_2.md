The error message suggests that the loss value returned by the `model.train_on_batch` function is `nan` (not a number) instead of the expected value of 0.

The potential error location is within the `weighted` function in the `weighted_masked_objective` method defined in the provided source code. The error is likely occurring because there is an issue with the calculation of the loss within the `weighted` function.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the weights and mask in the `weighted` function, leading to invalid or `nan` loss values.

To fix the bug, the `weighted` function should ensure proper handling of the weights and mask, perform appropriate calculations, and return the correct loss value.

Additionally, the calculation of the loss within the `train_on_batch` method should also be reviewed to ensure proper handling of the input data and the loss calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` method:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
            if mask is not None:
                score_array *= K.cast(mask, K.floatx())  # apply mask
                score_array /= K.mean(mask)  # adjust for masked samples
            score_array *= weights  # apply weights

        else:
