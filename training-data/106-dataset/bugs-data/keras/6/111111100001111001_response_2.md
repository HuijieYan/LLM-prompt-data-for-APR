Potential error location: The `weighted` function defined inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function is returning the wrong value. It is returning `K.mean(score_array)` instead of `score_array`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `weighted` function does not correctly calculate the weighted score and mean for the given parameters.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `weighted` function to correctly calculate the weighted score and mean by removing the unnecessary mean computation and ensuring the correct calculation of the weighted score.

        It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
