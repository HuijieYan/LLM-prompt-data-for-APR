Potential error location: The error may occur in the calculation of score_array when applying the mask and the sample weighting.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The mask is not cast to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano, which can lead to unexpected behavior when applying the mask to the score_array.
2. When applying sample weighting, the code reduces the score_array to the same ndim as the weight array, but this reduction may not align properly with the dimensions of the weights.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Cast the mask to floatX before applying it to the score_array.
2. Ensure that the reduction of the score_array aligns with the dimensions of the weights when applying sample weighting.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```
