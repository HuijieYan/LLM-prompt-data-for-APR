The error message indicates that the 'loss' value is returning as 'nan' (not a number) instead of 0. This implies that there is some issue in the calculation of the loss value, which is leading to a numerical instability.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'weighted' function, where the calculation of 'score_array' is happening.

The bug occurred because there were issues in handling the mask and weights. The 'mask' and 'weights' tensors were not handled properly, leading to incorrect calculations and a 'nan' loss value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'mask' and 'weights' tensors are handled properly. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the weights are all zeros in order to avoid division by zero errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            # Check for all zero weights to avoid division by zero
            if K.all(weights == 0):
                return 0
            score_array *= weights

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
