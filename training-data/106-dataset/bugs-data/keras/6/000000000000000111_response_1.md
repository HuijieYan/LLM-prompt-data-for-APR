Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the lines where the mask and weights are being used to modify the score_array.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the mask and weights, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the score_array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check whether the mask and weights have the correct dimensions and shapes for the operations being performed.
2. Ensure that the masking and weighting operations are performed in a way that maintains the integrity of the score_array.

Corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array = K.tf.multiply(score_array, mask)
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                                 axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array = K.tf.multiply(score_array, weights)
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
