The bug in the provided code is that the `weighted` function is defined inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function, but the `weighted` function needs to be returned from the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

The bug occurs because the `weighted` function is defined nested inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function but it should be returned from the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

To fix this, we need to move the definition of the `weighted` function out of the `weighted_masked_objective` function and then return it from the `weighted_masked_objective` function.
