The bug is likely in the function definition itself, where the function `weighted` is not redefined as intended. 

To fix the bug, you need to redefine the `weighted` function inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function and then return it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        
        if callable(fn):
            # score_array has ndim >= 2
            score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
            if mask is not None:
                # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
                mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
                # mask should have the same shape as score_array
                score_array *= mask
                #  the loss per batch should be proportional
                #  to the number of unmasked samples.
                score_array /= K.mean(mask)

            # apply sample weighting
            if weights is not None:
                # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
                ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
                weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
                score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                                     axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
                score_array *= weights
                score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
            return K.mean(score_array)

        else:
            raise ValueError("fn should be a callable function")

    return weighted
```
