Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring in the following lines:
- `score_array *= mask`: This line is trying to multiply a tensor with an optional mask, which may cause issues if the dimensions are not aligned.
- `score_array /= K.mean(mask)`: This line divides the `score_array` by the mean of the `mask`, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the optional `mask` and `weights` tensors properly. It also has issues with the calculation of the weighted objective function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Check for the presence of `mask` and `weights` before performing operations on them.
- Ensure that the operations are carried out in a way that is compatible with the dimensions of the input tensors.

Corrected Code:
```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None
