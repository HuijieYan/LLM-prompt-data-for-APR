1. The test case is testing the masking functionality and asserts that the loss should be 0 when the input and output arrays are filled with zeros.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the loss using the weighted and masked objective function.

3. The bug occurs because the calculation of the loss in the `weighted` function is not correctly handling the mask and weights, leading to a `NaN` result instead of 0.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the mask and weights are applied correctly to the calculation of the loss and that the mean is calculated properly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            
        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights

        if mask is not None:
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
