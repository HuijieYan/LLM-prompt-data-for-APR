The issue seems to be with the creation of the function `weighted_masked_objective` as it is not returning the correct function, leading to the assertion error in the test.

The potential error location is within the `weighted_masked_objective` function as it is not returning the correct `weighted` function.

The bug occurs because the `weighted_masked_objective` function is not correctly returning the `weighted` function that it creates. Instead, it is returning `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `weighted_masked_objective` function correctly returns the `weighted` function it creates.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                                 axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```

With this correction, the `weighted_masked_objective` function will correctly return the `weighted` function that it creates, and the test case should pass without errors.
