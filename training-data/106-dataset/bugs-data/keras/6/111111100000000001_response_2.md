Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the `weighted_masked_objective` function where the `weighted` function is nested within it. The nested `weighted` function is not returning the correct output.

Reason for the Bug: The `weighted_masked_objective` function is meant to wrap an objective function to add support for masking and sample-weighting. However, the nested `weighted` function is not correctly implementing this functionality.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The `weighted_masked_objective` function should return the `weighted` function without defining it again.
2. Modify the `weighted` function to correctly implement masking and sample-weighting as per the function's docstring.

Corrected Code:
```python

# relative function's signature in this file
def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
