# buggy function docstring

```text
Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
`fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

# Arguments
    fn: The objective function to wrap,
        with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

# Returns
    A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
```
