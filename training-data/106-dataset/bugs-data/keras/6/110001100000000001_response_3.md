The potential error in the given code is in the `weighted_masked_objective` function, where the `weighted` function is defined inside it. The bug is that the `weighted` function is not being used inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function. Instead, it is being returned as the output of the `weighted_masked_objective` function. 

This means that the `weighted_masked_objective` function is supposed to wrap the input objective function `fn` using the `weighted` function to add support for masking and sample-weighting. However, the code as it is will not achieve this.

To fix the bug, the `weighted` function needs to be called and its output should be returned as the result of the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # The code inside this function remains the same as it was in the original code
        
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
