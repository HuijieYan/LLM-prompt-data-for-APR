The potential error in the provided function is that it is not handling the inputs `weights` and `mask` properly. 

When `weights` and `mask` are provided, the function should apply the sample weighting and the mask to the `score_array` before returning the mean of the `score_array`.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
        
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
        
        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```
