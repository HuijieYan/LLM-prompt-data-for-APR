The error occurs when using `model.train_on_batch(x, y)` in the test function `test_masking_is_all_zeros`. The assertion `assert loss == 0` fails with the error `assert nan == 0`, indicating that the loss value is not being calculated correctly and resulting in a NaN value.

The potential error location is within the `weighted` function defined inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The issue might be with the calculation of `score_array` and how it is being handled with the `mask` and `weights`.

The bug occurs because the function `weighted` is returning a NaN value due to incorrect handling of the `mask` and `weights` or miscalculation of the `score_array`. This can be caused by mishandling of the tensors or failing to consider the dimensions and shapes of the input tensors.

To fix the bug, the `weighted` function should handle the `mask` and `weights` properly, ensuring that the operations are performed on tensors of the correct dimensions and that there are no division by zero or other unintended side effects.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
    
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
    
        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the `weighted` function handles the masking and weights separately, ensuring that the operations are performed on the `score_array` without causing NaN values.
