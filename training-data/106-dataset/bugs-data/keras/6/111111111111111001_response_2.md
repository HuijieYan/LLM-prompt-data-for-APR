The error occurs in the `weighted` function within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The error message from the test function indicates that the loss value after training is 'nan' instead of 0, which suggests that there is a bug in the loss calculation.

The potential error location is within the calculation of the `score_array` and the subsequent calculations involving the weights and masks. It seems like there may be an issue with handling the masks and weights when calculating the loss.

The error is likely occurring because the calculations involving masks and weights are not being handled properly, leading to the incorrect loss value.

To fix the bug, the mask and weights need to be properly integrated into the loss calculation. Additionally, the handling of 'nan' values and division by zero needs to be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.

        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())

            score_array *= mask
