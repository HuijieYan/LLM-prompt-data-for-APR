The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the loss with the weights and the mask.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the masking and weights correctly. It seems that the calculation of the loss with the weights and mask is leading to the unexpected `nan` value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mask and weights are applied correctly to the score array before calculating the loss.

Here's the corrected code for the weighted_masked_objective function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)  # Calculating the raw score_array

        if mask is not None:
            # Applying the mask to the score_array
            score_array = K.cast(mask, K.floatx()) * score_array
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.greater(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        # Apply sample weighting if weights are provided
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.greater(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
