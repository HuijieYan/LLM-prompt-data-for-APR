The error message indicates that the computed loss is not equal to 0 as expected, but rather it is returning a `nan` (not a number) value.

The potential error lies in the `weighted_masked_objective` function. It seems that the calculation of the loss is not properly handling the mask and weights, which is leading to the `nan` result.

The bug likely occurs because the function does not handle the case where the mask and weights are not properly applied or normalized, leading to unexpected results and potentially division by zero.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the mask and weights are properly handled and normalized before using them for calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # Score array computation
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # Apply the mask to the score_array
            score_array = score_array * mask
            # Normalize the score_array based on the mask
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            # Normalize the weights
            weights = K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx())
            weights /= K.mean(weights)

            # Apply the weights to the score_array
            score_array = score_array * weights
        
        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the mask and weights are properly handled and normalized before being used for computations. This should fix the bug and prevent the occurrence of `nan` values in the loss calculation.
