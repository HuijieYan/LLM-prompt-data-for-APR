Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the function `weighted_masked_objective` as it is not returning the expected function `weighted`, which indicates that there might be an issue with the inner `weighted` function creation.

Reason behind the Bug:
The issue is likely due to the fact that the inner `weighted` function is not being properly returned from the `weighted_masked_objective` function. This may be caused by improper handling of the inner function creation and return.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the inner `weighted` function needs to be properly created and returned from the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                                 axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    # Return the inner function
    return weighted
