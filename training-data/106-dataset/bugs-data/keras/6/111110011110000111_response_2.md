Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the loss within the `weighted` function of the `weighted_masked_objective` method.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug may be occurring due to incorrect calculations of the loss when applying the mask and weights. The test case involves a scenario where the input data is all zeros, which could be causing issues with the calculation of the loss.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of applying the mask and weights to ensure that the calculations are accurate.
2. Verify the handling of edge cases, such as when the input data is all zeros, and adjust the calculations accordingly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.

            weights: Weights tensor.
