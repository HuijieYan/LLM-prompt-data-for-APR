The error message from the test function indicates that the loss returned by the model is a NaN (Not a Number) value. This suggests that there is a problem with the calculation of the loss in the `weighted` function inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

The potential error location within the `weighted` function is in the following line:
```python
score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
```
This line tries to perform division by the mean of non-zero elements of the weights tensor. However, if all the elements in the weights tensor are zero, this operation will produce a NaN value, as division by zero is undefined.

To fix this issue, the code can be modified to handle the case where all the elements in the weights tensor are zero.

The corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function is as follows:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None and K.sum(weights) != 0:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                                 axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to ensure that the sum of the weights is not zero before performing division by the mean of non-zero elements of the weights tensor. This check prevents division by zero and the resulting NaN value.
