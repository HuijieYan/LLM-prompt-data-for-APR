The error message indicates that the `loss` value returned by the `model.train_on_batch` function is not equal to the expected value of 0. Additionally, the error message shows that the actual value is `nan` (not a number), which is unexpected.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the issue lies within the `weighted` function defined inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The `weighted` function calculates the loss using sample weighting and masking, but there might be an issue with how these calculations are performed, leading to the unexpected `nan` value.

One potential reason for the bug could be the mishandling of the mask or the weights, leading to invalid calculations. Another reason could be the incorrect handling of the input arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` inside the `weighted` function.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the mask and weights are appropriately applied to the `score_array` and that the input arrays are handled correctly based on their shapes and data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask and weights to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            weights = K.cast(weights, K.floatx())
            # apply mask to score_array
            score_array *= mask
            # calculate the loss per batch based on the number of unmasked samples
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the mask and weights are cast to the appropriate data type, and they are applied to `score_array` correctly. Additionally, the handling of the input arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` remains unchanged as their processing seems appropriate.
