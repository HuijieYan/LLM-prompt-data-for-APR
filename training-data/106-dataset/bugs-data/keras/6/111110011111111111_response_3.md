Potential error location:
The issue could be in the `weighted` function of the `weighted_masked_objective` method. Specifically, the problem seems to be related to the calculation of the `loss` and its comparison with zero.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect calculation of the loss in the `weighted` function. It seems that the loss calculation is resulting in a `NaN` (not a number) value, which is causing the assertion error in the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the calculations within the `weighted` function need to be reviewed. Particular attention should be paid to the handling of the weights, the mask, and the mean calculations, as these areas could potentially lead to the generation of `NaN` values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.sum(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.sum(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the mean is calculated using `K.sum()` instead of `K.mean(mask)` and `K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))` instead of `K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))`. This should prevent the occurrence of `NaN` values and address the bug.
