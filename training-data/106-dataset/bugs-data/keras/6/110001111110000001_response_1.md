The error message indicates that the computed loss value is getting evaluated as 'nan' instead of the expected value of 0. This suggests that there is a problem with the loss calculation in the model training process.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `weighted` function. The issue seems to be related to how the mask and weights are applied to the `score_array` before computing the loss.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, leading to incorrect loss computation and resulting in 'nan' values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `weighted` function to correctly handle the mask and weights, ensuring that the loss is computed accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    # ... (other unchanged code) ...

    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask  # Element-wise multiplication with mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)  # Normalize by the mean of the mask

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights  # Element-wise multiplication with weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))  # Normalize by the mean of non-zero weights

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
