The potential error in this function is that when applying sample weighting, the code is attempting to calculate the mean of the score array along the axes of the weight array. However, the code is using the axis parameter incorrectly. 

To fix this, we should first calculate the mean of the score array and then apply the sample weights.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array = K.mean(score_array)  # Calculate the mean of score_array
            score_array *= weights  # Apply the sample weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))  # Normalize by mean of non-zero weights
        return score_array  # Return the weighted score array
    return weighted
