1. The test case "test_masking_is_all_zeros" is testing whether the loss is 0 when the input data is all zeros. The error message indicates that the actual loss is producing a NaN (Not a Number) value instead of 0.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the loss using the weighted masked objective. There may be an issue with the handling of the mask, weights, or the calculation itself.

3. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the mask or weights, causing the loss calculation to result in a NaN value.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mask and weights are applied correctly to the score array, and the subsequent calculations are performed using appropriate scaling and averaging.

5. Below is the corrected code for the weighted_masked_objective function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

# this is the corrected function
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            # Calculate the mean of the score_array
            score_array_means = K.mean(score_array, axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array = K.expand_dims(score_array, axis=weight_ndim)
            weights = K.expand_dims(weights, axis=-1)
            # Applying the weights to the score_array
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(weights)
            # Reduce the dimensions to 1
            score_array = K.mean(score_array, axis=tuple(range(K.ndim(score_array) - 1)))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```

The corrected code includes proper handling of the mask and weights, as well as the calculations for the weighted masked objective. This should address the issue of producing NaN values and ensure correct loss calculation.
