The error message in the test case suggests that a layer called 'dense_1_input' does not support masking, even though it was passed an input mask. This indicates that the masking functionality is not working as expected, leading to an error during model execution.

The potential error location is within the masking layer, specifically in the `compute_mask` method. The error occurs because the 'dense_1_input' layer is being passed an input mask, but it does not support masking.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method of the `InputLayer` class is not properly handling the input arguments related to masking, which affects downstream layers. Specifically, the logic related to `self.is_placeholder` and `input_tensor` is not correctly identifying whether the input tensor has been provided or if a placeholder should be created.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method of the `InputLayer` class needs to be modified to correctly handle the input arguments related to masking. Specifically, it needs to properly determine whether an input tensor has been provided or whether a placeholder should be created. The logic related to `self.is_placeholder` and `input_tensor` should be revised to address this issue.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `InputLayer` class:

```python
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)

    self.trainable = False
    self.built = True
    self.sparse = sparse

    if input_tensor is not None:
        self.is_placeholder = False
        self.input_spec = keras.engine.base_layer.InputSpec(shape=K.int_shape(input_tensor))
    else:
        self.is_placeholder = True
        self.input_spec = keras.engine.base_layer.InputSpec(shape=(None,) + batch_input_shape[1:])

    if input_tensor is None:
        input_tensor = K.placeholder(shape=batch_input_shape,
                                     dtype=dtype,
                                     sparse=sparse,
                                     name=self.name)

    input_tensor._keras_shape = batch_input_shape
    input_tensor._uses_learning_phase = False
    input_tensor._keras_history = (self, 0, 0)

    self.batch_input_shape = batch_input_shape
    self.dtype = dtype
```

By making these modifications, the bug related to masking in the `InputLayer` class will be resolved, and the downstream layers will be able to support masking as expected.
