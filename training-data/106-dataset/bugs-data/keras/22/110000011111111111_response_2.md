The error message indicates that there is an issue with masking in the `TimeDistributed` layer, specifically with the layer named `dense_1_input` not supporting masking.

The problem is likely occurring in the `TimeDistributed` layer where the input tensor is passed to the `Dense` layer, and the masking behavior is not properly handled.

This bug is likely caused by changes in the way masking is handled in Keras 2.2.0, leading to issues in the `TimeDistributed` layer's compatibility with masking.

To fix the bug, the `InputLayer` class needs to be explicitly set to support masking in cases where it is passed to the `TimeDistributed` layer. This can be achieved by overriding the `compute_mask` method within the `InputLayer` class.

Below is the corrected code for the `InputLayer` class:

```python
from keras.layers import InputLayer

class InputLayerWithMaskingSupport(InputLayer):
    def compute_mask(self, inputs, mask=None):
        # Support masking for the input layer
        return K.not_equal(inputs, 0)
```

With this modification, the `InputLayerWithMaskingSupport` class adds support for masking where it checks if the input is not equal to 0. This new class can be used in place of the original `InputLayer` when creating the input layer in the Keras model.

Here is the corrected function/method with the suggested fix:

```python
from keras import backend as K
from keras.layers import InputLayer

class CustomInputLayer(InputLayer):
    def compute_mask(self, inputs, mask=None):
        return K.not_equal(inputs, 0)

def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None,
             sparse=False, name=None):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    super(CustomInputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By using the `CustomInputLayer` class that extends `InputLayer` and overrides the `compute_mask` method, support for masking is explicitly provided, addressing the issue in the `TimeDistributed` layer.

The fix ensures that the `InputLayer` class explicitly supports masking, allowing it to work correctly with the `TimeDistributed` layer.
