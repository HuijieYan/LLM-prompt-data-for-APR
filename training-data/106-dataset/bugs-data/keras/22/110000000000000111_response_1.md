The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the masking functionality, as indicated in the error message:

"TypeError: Layer dense_1_input does not support masking, but was passed an input_mask"

The bug occurred likely because the InputLayer was not properly handling the masking functionality in Keras 2.2.0, leading to the error when using masking in later layers such as Dense and TimeDistributed.

To fix the bug, the InputLayer needs to be modified to properly handle the masking functionality. One possible approach is to ensure that the InputLayer supports masking and propagates the input mask to subsequent layers.

Here's the corrected code for the InputLayer:

```python
from keras.engine.base_layer import Layer

class InputLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
                 batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None,
                 sparse=False, name=None, input_mask=None):
        if not name:
            prefix = 'input'
            name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
        super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)

        self.trainable = False
        self.built = True
        self.sparse = sparse
        self.supports_masking = True  # Add support for masking

        if input_mask is not None:
            self.input_mask = input_mask  # Propagate the input mask

        # Rest of the original code here
```

In the corrected code, the InputLayer class inherits from the Layer class and introduces support for masking. It includes a parameter for input_mask and propagates this input mask to subsequent layers. This modification should address the issue with masking in Keras 2.2.0.
