The error occurs when the function `compute_mask` is called on the layer `TimeDistributed`. The error message indicates that the layer `dense_1_input` does not support masking, but an input mask was passed to it.

Upon analyzing the function `__init__` of the `InputLayer` class, it seems that the bug might be in the code related to setting the `input_tensor` and the automatic input shape inference. Specifically, the error occurs when the `input_tensor` is set, and `batch_input_shape` is not set. This is because the `dtype` and `name` attributes have not been initialized properly, leading to errors down the line.

To fix the bug, proper initialization of the `dtype` and `name` attributes should be included in the `__init__` function of the `InputLayer` class.

Corrected code for the problematic `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    if dtype is None:
        if input_tensor is None:
            dtype = K.floatx()
        else:
            dtype = K.dtype(input_tensor)
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

By initializing the `dtype` conditionally, and ensuring that the `name` attribute is properly set if it's not provided, the bug in the `__init__` function should be fixed. This will prevent issues related to input masking in the downstream layers.
