The bug occurs in the `InputLayer` class within the `__init__` method. The error message from the test function indicates that the layer `dense_1_input` does not support masking, but it was passed an input mask, causing a TypeError.

The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of support for masking in the `InputLayer` class. The `InputLayer` class should not support masking, as it is an entry point into a model and not a layer that performs transformations.

To fix the bug, the `InputLayer` class should explicitly state that it does not support masking, and the `compute_mask` method should return `None`, indicating that no masks are supported.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None, batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class InputLayer(Layer):
    """
    Layer to be used as an entry point into a model.
    ...
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None, batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
        if not name:
            prefix = 'input'
            name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
        super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)
    
        self.trainable = False
        self.built = True
        self.sparse = sparse
        self.supports_masking = False  # Set support for masking to False
    
        # The rest of the method remains unchanged

    def compute_mask(self, inputs, mask=None):
        return None  # Return None as InputLayer does not support masking
```

With this correction, the `InputLayer` class explicitly states that it does not support masking, preventing the TypeError encountered in the test.
