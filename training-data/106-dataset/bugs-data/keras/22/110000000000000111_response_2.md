Potential error location: The error message is related to the use of masking in the `Masking` layer. The function that is causing this error is the `__init__` method of the `InputLayer`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by changes in the implementation of masking in Keras 2.2.0, which may have affected the handling of masking in the `InputLayer` class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the changes made to the `Masking` layer in Keras 2.2.0 and its interaction with the `InputLayer`.
2. Ensure that the `InputLayer` is compatible with existing masking mechanisms in Keras 2.2.0.
3. Update the `__init__` method of the `InputLayer` to handle masking correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected __init__ method of the InputLayer
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None, **kwargs):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    self.input_spec = InputSpec(ndim=len(input_shape), dtype=dtype)
    self.supports_masking = True

    self._add_inbound_node()
```
This corrected code includes handling for masking and also sets the `supports_masking` attribute to `True` to support the masking mechanism in Keras 2.2.0.
