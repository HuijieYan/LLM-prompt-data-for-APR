The error occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the input mode is 'torch' and the data type of the input x is integer. Specifically, the error is raised when trying to subtract the mean values from the input x, which is of type int32. This operation causes a data type mismatch and triggers the error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the input x is converted to a floating-point type before performing the mean subtraction. This will allow the subtraction operation to be performed without encountering a data type conflict.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    # Convert x to float if it's not already
    x = x.astype('float32')
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this change, we ensure that the input x is always converted to float before arithmetic operations are performed, addressing the data type mismatch issue.
