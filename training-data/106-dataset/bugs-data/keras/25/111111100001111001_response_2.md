The bug in the _preprocess_numpy_input function is that the 'caffe' mode does not apply to certain cases. When the mode is 'caffe' and the data_format is 'channels_first', the function does not correctly convert the image from RGB to BGR. The error occurs because the 'caffe' mode only handles the conversion from RGB to BGR but does not handle the mean subtraction and scaling.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'caffe' mode handles the RGB to BGR conversion and also performs the mean subtraction and scaling as required.

Here's the corrected code for the _preprocess_numpy_input function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        x -= 1.
