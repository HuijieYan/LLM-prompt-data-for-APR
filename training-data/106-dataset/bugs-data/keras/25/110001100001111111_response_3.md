The bug occurs when the input is in 'caffe' mode and the data format is 'channels_first'. This results in incorrect operations on the input array `x`. 

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly sets the mean and std values based on the `mode` and `data_format` without considering the actual mode and format of the input array.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly compute the preprocessed array `x` based on the mode and data format, taking into account the actual settings of these parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_last':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode == 'torch' and std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean
    
    return x
```

This corrected function takes into account the actual mode and data format parameters provided as input, correctly preprocesses the input array `x`, and returns the preprocessed array.
