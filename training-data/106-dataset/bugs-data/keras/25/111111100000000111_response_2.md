The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'tf' and 'torch' modes. 

The bug occurs because in the 'tf' mode, the function is incorrectly scaling pixels between -1 and 1, contrary to the correct scale of -1 to 1. In the 'torch' mode, the function is incorrectly normalizing each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, which should not be the case.

To fix the bug, the scaling and normalization operations have to be corrected in the 'tf' and 'torch' modes.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[:, 0] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[:, 0, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :] -= 123.68
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68
    return x
```
