Potential Error Location:
The potential error in this function is the mishandling of the 'caffe' mode, where it is not properly converting the images from RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'caffe' mode is not being properly handled in the function. The 'caffe' mode requires specific preprocessing steps which are not being implemented correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add the proper preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode. This includes converting the images from RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 
In the corrected code, the 'caffe' mode has been properly handled with the required preprocessing steps, including converting the images from RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling. This should fix the bug.
