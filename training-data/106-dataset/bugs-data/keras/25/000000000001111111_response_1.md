The issue with the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it is not correctly handling the different modes ('tf', 'torch', and others) and data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last'). The function also has inconsistencies in its handling of the 'mean' and 'std' values based on the mode and data format.

The bug is due to the mixture of conditionals for 'mode' and 'data_format'. The function does not correctly handle all configurations of 'mode' and 'data_format', leading to incorrect preprocessing.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to appropriately handle all combinations of 'mode' and 'data_format', and to correctly apply the mean and standard deviation adjustments based on the channel and data format.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= 103.939
                x[1] -= 116.779
                x[2] -= 123.68
                if std is not None:
                    x[0] /= 0.229
                    x[1] /= 0.224
                    x[2] /= 0.225
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2] -= 123.68
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= 0.229
                    x[:, 1] /= 0.224
                    x[:, 2] /= 0.225
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= 0.229
                x[..., 1] /= 0.224
                x[..., 2] /= 0.225
    return x
```

In the corrected function:
- The conditional statements have been adjusted to properly handle all possible combinations of 'mode' and 'data_format'.
- The calculations for mean and standard deviation adjustments have been updated to match the specifications for each mode and data format.
