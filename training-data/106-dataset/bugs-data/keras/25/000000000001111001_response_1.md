The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it doesn't properly handle the `mode` and `data_format` input parameters. The function should normalize the input `x` differently depending on the value of `mode` and `data_format`.

- In the provided example, when `mode` is `'tf'`, the normalization process follows a specific formula. If `mode` is `'torch'`, then another normalization process is applied.
- Additionally, based on the `data_format`, the function should handle the color channel order differently.

To address this issue, we can refactor the function to incorporate the specific normalization process based on the `mode` input and the color channel order based on the `data_format`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        # Handle data_format 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'
        if data_format == 'channels_first' and x.ndim == 4:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        elif x.ndim == 4:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
    return x
```

In the corrected function, the specific normalization processes based on the value of `mode` and the color channel order based on `data_format` are properly handled. Additionally, the logic for handling the color channel order and normalization process based on the values of `mode` and `data_format` are now correctly implemented.
