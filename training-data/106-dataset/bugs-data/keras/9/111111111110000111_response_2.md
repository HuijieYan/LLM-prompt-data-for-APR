The issue is related to the incorrect formatting of bullet points in the generated documentation. The problem lies in the `process_list_block` function. The function is not correctly handling the conversion of list items into bullet points.

One potential reason for the bug is that the code does not correctly identify list items and format them as bullet points.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `process_list_block` function to correctly identify list items and format them as bullet points in the generated documentation.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Format list items as bullet points
    lines = [re.sub(r'^ {4}([\w\s]+):', r'- __\1__:', line) for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected code, after removing leading white spaces from each line, we use regular expression to format list items as bullet points. The updated regular expression correctly identifies list items and formats them as bullet points in the generated documentation.
