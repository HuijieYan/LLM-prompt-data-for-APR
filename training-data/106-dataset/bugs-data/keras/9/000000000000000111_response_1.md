The error in the provided function is that the 'block' variable is not being correctly processed. The code is trying to replace the 'block' with a 'marker' in the 'docstring_slice' variable, but it is not correctly finding and replacing 'block'. This is causing the incorrect processing of the 'block' variable, leading to incorrect output.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to use the correct index for replacing the 'block' with the 'marker' in the 'docstring_slice' variable. We can achieve this by finding the correct index of the 'block' in the 'docstring_slice' and replacing it with the 'marker'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker) + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\s', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring_slice, block
```

This corrected function should now correctly process the 'block' variable and return the expected output.
