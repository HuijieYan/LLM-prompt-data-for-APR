The bug in the function process_list_block appears to be with the calculation of the block variable. The ending_point is calculated using the find function which returns the index of the first occurrence of '\n\n' after the starting_point. Then, the block variable is assigned using this ending_point to slice the docstring. However, the condition to slice the docstring should be ending_point instead of ending_point - 1.

To fix this issue, we need to correct the calculation of the ending_point in the function process_list_block.

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]  # Corrected the slice ending point
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
    return docstring, block
```
