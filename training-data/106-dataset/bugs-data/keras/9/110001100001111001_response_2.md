The code above processes a given documentation string and extracts a list block from it based on the provided parameters. It then modifies the block and the docstring and returns the updated docstring and the processed block.

The bug occurs when the function attempts to extract the block from the docstring. The ending_point is calculated based on the position of the double newline characters (`\n\n`), but there is a potential issue with the usage of slicing in the statement `ending_point - 1`. 

Additionally, after modification, the return sequence is not handling the newlines properly, which causes the extra spaces and incorrect replacements.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the ending_point calculation and handle the newlines after replacing the block in the docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- {1,5}', '- ', line) for line in lines]  # fix indentation for list items
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix text lines after lists
    for i in range(len(lines)-1, 0, -1):
        if lines[i] == '':
            del lines[i]
        elif lines[i].startswith('- '):
            lines[i] = '\n' + lines[i]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
