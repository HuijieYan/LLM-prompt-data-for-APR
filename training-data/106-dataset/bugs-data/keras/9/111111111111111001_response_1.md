Potential error location: The issue likely arises from the manipulation of the 'docstring' and 'docstring_slice', as well as the transformation of the 'lines' variable.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The variable 'ending_point' is not correctly calculated, which results in an incorrect value for 'block' and 'docstring_slice'.
2. The manipulation of 'lines' is complex and prone to errors because it is split and then transformed based on whitespace, list markers, and text blocks. The nested loop logic is difficult to follow and reason about.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Calculate the 'ending_point' and 'block' accurately.
2. Simplify the logic of transforming 'lines' by splitting it into separate, more understandable steps.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    block_lines = []
    text_block = False
    for line in lines:
        line = re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line)
        if line.startswith('-'):
            line = '- ' + line.strip()
        block_lines.append(line)
    block = '\n'.join(block_lines)
    return docstring, block
```
