Potential error location: 
The statement `docstring = (docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:])` seems to be causing the issue, as it is attempting to replace the `block` with the `marker` in `docstring` but is not correctly handling the replacement operation.

Reason for the bug:
The code is not handling the replacement of `block` with `marker` properly, which is causing the incorrect output.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `replace` method on `docstring` to replace `block` with `marker` instead of extracting a `docstring_slice`.
2. Ensure that the replacement is handled correctly by updating the `docstring` variable with the correct replacement operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring = docstring.replace(block, marker)
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
