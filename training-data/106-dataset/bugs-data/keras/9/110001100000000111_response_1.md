Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the formatting of bullet points in the docstrings of certain models.

Reasons behind the bug: The process_list_block function is responsible for processing the docstrings and reformatting them for display purposes. It appears that this function is not handling the bullet points correctly, resulting in the incorrect display of the docstrings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the process_list_block function to properly handle bullet points and reformat the docstrings accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the bullet points in the docstrings.

Corrected code for the process_list_block function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Fix bullet points
    lines = [re.sub(r'^\s*(- .*)', r'- \1', line) for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
