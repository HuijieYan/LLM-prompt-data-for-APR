The error occurs because the `process_list_block` function does not correctly handle the replacement of the block within the `docstring_slice`. This leads to inconsistencies and assertion errors in the test case.

The bug is due to incorrect handling of slicing and replacement of the `block` within the `docstring_slice`. The `ending_point` calculation for the block is also incorrect, leading to issues.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the slicing, replacement, and calculation of the `ending_point` to ensure the correct replacement of the `block` within the `docstring_slice`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker) + docstring[section_end:]
    docstring = docstring_slice
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected code addresses the issues related to slicing, replacement, and calculation of the `ending_point`, ensuring that the `block` is correctly replaced within the `docstring_slice`.
