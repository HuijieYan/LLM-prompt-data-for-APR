The bug in the provided function `process_list_block` seems to be related to how the `block` variable is being generated and modified. The `block` is being generated from the `docstring` using the `starting_point` and `ending_point`, but the ending point is not being handled correctly. This is causing the `block` to include an extra character at the end.

The function also seems to have issues with how it removes leading white spaces and handles list formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the `ending_point` is being calculated and handle the list formatting correctly. Additionally, we can improve the logic for removing leading white spaces and correcting the list formatting.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ', '- __', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r':\s+', '__: ', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

With these changes, the `ending_point` is now calculated correctly, and the list formatting and leading whitespaces are handled more effectively. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
