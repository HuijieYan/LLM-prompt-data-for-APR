The bug occurs due to incorrect manipulation of the docstring in the process_list_block function. The function removes the list items' leading spaces, tries to detect list roots, and remove 4 leading spaces, but it does so incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the list items' leading spaces, detect list roots, and remove leading spaces as mentioned in the code comments. Additionally, the code should properly handle the replacement of the original block with the marker.

Here's the corrected code for the process_list_block function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    replacement = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + replacement.replace(block, marker) + docstring[section_end:]
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    updated_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        if re.match(top_level_regex, line):
            updated_lines.append(re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line))
        else:
            updated_lines.append(re.sub(r'^ {4}', '', line))
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    block = ''
    text_block = False
    for line in updated_lines:
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    block += '\n'
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                block += '\n'
            block += line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
            block += line
    return docstring, block
```

This updated function properly handles the list items' leading spaces, detects list roots, removes leading spaces correctly, and replaces the original block with the marker as intended. This should resolve the issues observed in the test case and associated error message.
