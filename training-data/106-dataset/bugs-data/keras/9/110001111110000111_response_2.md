The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the formatting of the docstring. The expected docstring contains list elements with bullet points, but the actual docstring does not have the bullet points.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the `process_list_block` function is responsible for processing the docstring and formatting it. It splits the docstring into blocks and processes the list elements by inserting markers, replacing leading spaces, and detecting list roots.

The reason behind the bug is likely related to the inconsistent processing of list elements, which leads to incorrect formatting in the final docstring.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for processing list elements in the `process_list_block` function. We need to ensure that the list elements are correctly processed and formatted with bullet points in the final docstring.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]

    # Place marker for later reinjection
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]

    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    result_lines = []
    indent = -1
    for line in lines:
        if '-' in line:
            if indent == -1:
                indent = line.index('-')
            line = re.sub(r'^\s*-', '  -', line)
        elif indent != -1:
            line = ' ' * indent + line.lstrip()
        result_lines.append(line)

    block = '\n'.join(result_lines)
    return docstring, block
```

In the corrected function, we have modified the logic for processing list elements to ensure that they are properly formatted with bullet points in the final docstring. This should resolve the formatting mismatch issue identified in the error message.
