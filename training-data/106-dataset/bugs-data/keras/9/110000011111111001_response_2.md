The bug in the `process_list_block` function is likely to be due to inappropriate handling and modification of the `docstring` and `block` variables. The function tries to find a block within the `docstring` based on the `starting_point` and `ending_point`, and then it replaces a portion of the `docstring` with the `block` using a `marker`.

The reason for the bug could be incorrect handling of the indices and substrings, resulting in unexpected modifications to the `docstring` and `block` variables. This could lead to discrepancies between the expected and actual values in the subsequent processing steps of the function.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly extract the `block` from the `docstring`, replace the corresponding section in the `docstring` with the `marker`, and then process the `block` as needed (e.g., splitting lines, removing leading spaces, modifying patterns, etc.).

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point if ending_point != -1 else None].strip()
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = docstring[:starting_point] + docstring_slice + docstring[section_end:]
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Remove any additional leading spaces from list items
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- (.*?)$', r'- \1', line) for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

With this correction, the function should work as expected and pass the test cases without errors.
