The bug seems to be occurring in the `process_list_block` function when it is trying to format a documentation string for the `EarlyStopping` model. The function seems to be incorrectly processing the block of text that represents the "Arguments" section of the documentation.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly detecting and modifying the leading spaces and list structures within the block of text. This causes the formatting to be incorrect, leading to the wrong output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and process the list elements in the text block, as well as handle the leading spaces properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Update the list root lines with proper formatting
    updated_lines = []
    for line in lines:
        updated_line = line
        if '-' in line:
            line_parts = line.split(':')
            if len(line_parts) == 2:
                updated_line = "- __{}__:{}".format(line_parts[0].strip(), line_parts[1])
        updated_lines.append(updated_line)
    block = '\n'.join(updated_lines)
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function should properly format the "Arguments" section of the documentation, ensuring that the list elements and leading spaces are processed correctly.
