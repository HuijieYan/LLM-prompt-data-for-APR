The bug seems to be related to formatting the `Arguments` section in the documentation. The error message indicates a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

Analyzing the code, it seems that the `process_list_block` function is designed to format a block of text, which includes handling lists and bullet points in the documentation.

The error in the function might be due to incorrect list formatting and handling of leading spaces. The function fails to correctly transform the input text into the expected output format, leading to the error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Identify and correct the logic responsible for formatting lists and bullet points in the `process_list_block` function.
2. Ensure that the function handles leading spaces, bullet points, and text formatting effectively to produce the expected output.

The corrected `process_list_block` function is as follows:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]  # Strip leading and trailing whitespace

    if all(line.startswith('-') for line in lines):  # Check if all lines start with a '-'
        lines = [re.sub(r'^- ', '- ', line) for line in lines]  # Remove the leading spaces except for the bullet point

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected function adds logic to effectively handle leading spaces, bullet points, and formatting of the input text block, ensuring that the function returns the expected format.
