The error message shows that there is a mismatch between the expected HTML output and the actual output. The issue seems to be related to the correct formatting of lists in the docstring.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of list items and their formatting in the `process_list_block` function. The function is responsible for processing the docstring and modifying it according to certain rules. The error is likely to be occurring during the manipulation of lists within the docstring.

The bug occurs because the function `process_list_block` does not properly handle the conversion of list items from plain text format to HTML format. This results in incorrect formatting and an assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly format the list items and ensure that they are transformed into the expected HTML format.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'(    )([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)', r'- __\2__:\3', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function should properly format the list items and transform them into the expected HTML format. This fix should resolve the issue with incorrect formatting and the assertion error in the test case.
