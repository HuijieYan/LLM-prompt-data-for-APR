The problematic function is the `add` method that is meant to add a layer instance on top of the layer stack in a Sequential model. The method checks if the layer is an instance of the `Layer` class, and if not, it raises a `TypeError`. It then proceeds to handle different scenarios for setting the input shape and adding the layers, performing various checks in the process.

Based on the provided buggy cases and expected cases, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `.add()` method handles adding layers to the Sequential model and setting the inputs. In the provided cases, the `.add()` method does not seem to handle the addition of layers correctly, leading to unexpected behaviors compared to the expected cases.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that when a layer is added, it is added to the list of layers in the Sequential model, and the input shape is appropriately handled.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic of adding layers and setting inputs. Additionally, the checks for input shape and building the model should be done in a separate method, such as `build_model()`, instead of within the `add` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    self._layers.append(layer)  # Add the layer to the list of layers
```

By simplifying the `add` method to just append the layer to the list of layers, we can improve readability and reduce the complexity of this method. The other functionality, such as setting the input shape and building the model, can be handled in separate methods such as `build_model()`.
