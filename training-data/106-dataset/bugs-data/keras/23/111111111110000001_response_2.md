The error occurs when trying to add an inner model to the outer model. This indicates an issue with the `add` function where it expects an `InputLayer` but receives a `Dense` layer. This is why it's trying to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute in the `Dense` layer, which doesn't exist, and causing an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `add` function should be modified to handle the addition of submodels correctly. It should iterate through the layers of the added model and add them to the outer model.

Here's the corrected `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        for sublayer in layer.layers:
            self.add(sublayer)
    elif not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    else:
        if not self._layers:
            self.built = False
            inputs = Input(shape=(input_shape[1],))
            layer(inputs)
            self.outputs = [layer.outputs[0]]
            self.inputs = layer.inputs
        else:
            output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
            if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
                self.outputs = output_tensor
            else:
                self.outputs = [output_tensor]
        if self.inputs:
            self.build()
        else:
            self._layers.append(layer)
```

With this code, when a submodel (`Sequential`) is added to the outer model, it iterates through the layers of the submodel and adds them to the outer model. If a regular layer is added, it also handles it correctly.
