Sure, here's the full code of the fixed function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    allowed_layers = (Layer, Sequential, Dense, InputLayer)
    if not isinstance(layer, allowed_layers):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer, Sequential, Dense, or InputLayer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this modification, the `add` method will now accept instances of the `Layer`, `Sequential`, `Dense`, and `InputLayer` classes, resolving the issue.
