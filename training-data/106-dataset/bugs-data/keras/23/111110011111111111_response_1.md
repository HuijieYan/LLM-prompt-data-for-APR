The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` related to the `batch_input_shape` attribute of a `Dense` layer. This error occurs when trying to access `batch_input_shape` attribute of the `Dense` layer, which does not exist in the `Dense` layer class.

The buggy function `add()` in the Sequential class seems to incorrectly handle the addition of layers and inferring the input shape. The code tries to access `batch_input_shape` from the `Dense` layer, which is not valid.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `add()` function to handle the addition of layers correctly and infer the input shape using input layers or using the automatic shape inference.

Below is the corrected code for the `add()` function in the `Sequential` class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has multiple output tensors, or is already connected somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    if hasattr(layer, 'inbound_nodes') and layer.inbound_nodes:
        raise ValueError('A layer that has already been connected is being added to the sequential model.')

    if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
        batch_shape = layer.batch_input_shape
        dtype = layer.dtype
        set_inputs = True
    else:
        # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape. We will have to
        # build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
        batch_shape = None
        set_inputs = False

    if self.outputs:
        raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
    
    if set_inputs:
        x = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
        layer(x)
        self.outputs = layer.inbound_nodes[0].output_tensors
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])

    self._layers.append(layer)
```

In the corrected code, the `add()` function now properly checks if the layer is already connected, infers the input shape, and appends the layer to the list of layers. Additionally, it raises appropriate errors in case of invalid layer additions.
