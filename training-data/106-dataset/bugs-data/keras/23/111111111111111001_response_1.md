The error occurs when the `add` method of the `Sequential` class is called with a nested `Sequential` model as the input layer.

The error message indicates that the 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape', which suggests that the issue might be related to trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist for the 'Dense' layer.

It seems that the bug occurs when setting the `batch_shape` inside the conditional block for `if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential))`. The code assumes that `layer` would have `batch_input_shape` attribute, which is not true for the `Dense` layer.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to refactor the code such that it handles the case when a nested `Sequential` model is added to the `Sequential` model. It should skip inferring `batch_shape` from `layer` if it is a `Dense` layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
