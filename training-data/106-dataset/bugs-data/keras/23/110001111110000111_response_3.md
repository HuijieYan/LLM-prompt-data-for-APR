The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` is trying to create a nested model using the `Sequential` class from Keras. It adds an inner model (`inner_model`) to the outer model (`model`) using the `add` function. The error message mentions that there is an attribute error on the line `batch_shape = first_layer.batch_input_shape` within the `add` function.

The potential error location is within the code block that checks if the `layer` is an instance of `Model` or `Sequential` type. When it is, the code tries to extract the `batch_input_shape` attribute from the `first_layer` object, assuming it to be an instance of an InputLayer, which might not always be the case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code incorrectly assumes that the `first_layer` always has a `batch_input_shape` attribute.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to add a condition to check if `batch_input_shape` attribute exists before extracting it. If it does not, a more appropriate error message should be raised notifying the user that the inner model lacks the necessary attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        set_inputs = False
        # First layer in model: check that it is an input layer.
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
            # First, we need to infer the expected input shape and dtype.
            first_layer = layer
            if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                # We were passed a model as the first layer.
                # This requires a specific way to figure out the
                # input shape and dtype.
                if not layer.layers:
                    raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model '
                                     'to a `Sequential` model.')
                # In case of nested models: recover the first layer
                # of the deepest model to infer input shape and dtype.
                first_layer = layer.layers[0]
                while isinstance(first_layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                    first_layer = first_layer.layers[0]
                if hasattr(first_layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                    batch_shape = first_layer.batch_input_shape
                    dtype = first_layer.dtype
                else:
                    raise ValueError('Cannot infer the input shape and dtype of the first layer in the nested model.')
                # Instantiate the input layer.
                x = Input(
                    batch_shape=batch_shape,
                    dtype=dtype,
                    name=layer.name + '_input')
                # This will build the current layer
                # and create the node connecting the current layer
                # to the input layer we just created.
                layer(x)
                set_inputs = True
    else:
        ...
        # (remaining code remains the same)
```

By adding a check for the existence of the `batch_input_shape` attribute and handling the scenario where it does not exist, we can avoid the attribute error and improve the robustness of the `add` function.
