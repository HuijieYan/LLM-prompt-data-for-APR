The error occurs when the `model.add(inner_model)` line is executed. This indicates that the `add` method within the `Sequential` class is causing the issue.

The error message "AttributeError: 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'" suggests that the function is trying to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute from a 'Dense' object, which does not have this attribute.

The bug occurs because when adding a nested model (inner_model) to the outer Sequential model, the code incorrectly assumes that the first layer of the nested model has a 'batch_input_shape' attribute, without checking the type of layer that is being added.

To fix this bug, the code should check the type of the layer being added and handle different types of layers (InputLayer, Model, Sequential) appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method within the `Sequential` class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """

```

In this corrected code, the `_check_model_input` method has been introduced to handle the input validation for the nested models. This method checks for empty models, and also ensures that the input layer of the nested model specifies its shape. It also avoids assuming the type of the first layer in the model, and instead correctly retrieves the first layer to infer input shape and dtype.
