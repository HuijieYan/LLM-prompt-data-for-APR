Sure, here's the full corrected code for the `add` method of the Sequential model in Python:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    
    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Set inputs and outputs for the model
            self.inputs = layer.input
            self.outputs = layer.output
            self.built = True
        else:
            # For non-InputLayer types, just add the layer to the model
            self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        # If the model already has layers, simply add the new layer
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

These changes ensure that the `add` method correctly handles the addition of layers to the Sequential model, including the first layer and subsequent ones.
