The problem with the `add` function is that it does not handle the case where the `layer` parameter is a `Sequential` instance. In this case, it should add the layers of the `Sequential` instance to the `_layers` list of the current model. This is currently not handled in the buggy function.

The code is attempting to check if the `layer` is an `InputLayer` by using `isinstance(layer, InputLayer)`. However, this check will always fail because `InputLayer` is a class from the Keras module, and the code is using `Layer` and not `keras.layers.Layer` to check the type.

To fix this bug, the `add` function needs to explicitly handle the case when `layer` is an instance of `Sequential`. It should iterate through the layers of the provided `Sequential` instance and add each layer to the `_layers` list.

The corrected `add` function code is as follows:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        for sub_layer in layer._layers:
            self.add(sub_layer)
    else:
        if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
            raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                            'an instance of class Layer. '
                            'Found: ' + str(layer))
        self.built = False
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This updated function now checks if the `layer` parameter is an instance of `Sequential` and, if it is, it iterates through the layers of the provided `Sequential` instance and adds each layer to the `_layers` list.
