Potential error location: The error could potentially be occurring within the logic that handles the addition of a new layer to the layer stack. 

Reasons for the bug: The bug could be caused by incorrect logic to handle the addition of layers to the layer stack, specifically related to handling the input shape and dtype of the first layer. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the input shape and dtype of the first layer are correctly inferred.
2. Check for the number of output tensors of the layers and handle the cases where multiple output tensors are present.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
