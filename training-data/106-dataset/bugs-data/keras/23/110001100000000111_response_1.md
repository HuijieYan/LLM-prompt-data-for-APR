The potential error in the `add` method is that it is not properly handling the addition of layers to the Sequential model. The method is not checking for multiple output tensors or if the layer is already connected somewhere else. Additionally, there are issues with setting inputs and outputs properly.

The bug occurs because the method does not have proper checks and error handling for adding layers to the Sequential model. It also does not handle input and output tensors for each layer added to the model.

To fix the bug, proper checks and error handling should be added to ensure that the layer being added is a valid layer instance, and that it has a single output tensor. Additionally, the method should properly handle setting inputs and outputs for each layer added to the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if hasattr(self, '_input_layers') and self.outputs:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    elif hasattr(self, '_input_layers'):
        set_inputs = False
        if not self.outputs:
            if not self.inputs:
                if not hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                    raise ValueError('The first layer in a Sequential model must have a defined input shape. Found: ' + str(layer))
                # Create input layer if not already defined
                if not self._layers:
                    x = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
                    layer(x)
                    self.inputs = [x]
                    self.outputs = [layer(x)]
                    set_inputs = True
            else:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        if not set_inputs:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')

            self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

This corrected code adds proper checks for layers being added to the Sequential model and sets inputs and outputs accordingly.
