Potential error location: The `add` method seems to have various conditional checks that could be leading to the bug.

Reasons for the bug: The `add` method does not properly handle the addition of a new layer to the stack. It has conditional checks for the input layer, multiple output tensors, and other scenarios, but these checks might not be working as expected or might be unnecessary.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the conditional checks and streamline the process of adding a new layer.
2. Ensure that the `InputLayer` and other layer instances are appropriately handled when adding them to the stack.
3. Remove unnecessary conditional checks that could be causing the confusion and potential bugs.
4. Ensure that the `self._layers` and `self.outputs` attributes are updated correctly when adding a new layer.

Corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    if not self._layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in the model must be an InputLayer.')
        
        self.inputs = layer
        self.outputs = layer.output
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs)
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        self.outputs = output_tensor
    
    self._layers.append(layer)
```
