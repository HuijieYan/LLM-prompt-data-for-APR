The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build()` attempts to create a nested sequential model by adding `inner_model` to the `model`. However, this operation raises an `AttributeError` due to the absence of `batch_input_shape` attribute in the `Dense` layer.

The potential error location is identified in the `add()` method of the `Sequential` class. Specifically, the code attempts to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute of `Dense` layer. This attribute does not exist for `Dense` layers.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the scenario where a layer is not an instance of `InputLayer`, `Model`, or `Sequential`. This prevents the `batch_input_shape` attribute from being accessed directly.

To fix the bug, a conditional check should be added within the `add()` method to handle the case where the layer is not an instance of `InputLayer`, `Model`, or `Sequential`. Additionally, the code should be refactored to ensure that the correct attributes and operations are accessed based on the type of layer being added.

Here's the corrected code for the `add()` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    self.built = False
    
    if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
        # Corner case where the user passes an InputLayer via `add`.
        assert len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) == 1
        set_inputs = True
    else:
        # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
        # We will have to build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
        batch_shape = None
        first_layer = layer
        if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):
            # We were passed a model as first layer.
            # This requires a specific way to figure out the
            # input shape and dtype.
            if not layer.layers:
                raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
            # In case of nested models: recover the first layer
            # of the deepest model to infer input shape and dtype.
            first_layer = layer.layers[0]
            while isinstance(first_layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                first_layer = first_layer.layers[0]
        if hasattr(first_layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            batch_shape = first_layer.batch_input_shape
            dtype = first_layer.dtype
            # Instantiate the input layer.
            x = Input(
                batch_shape=batch_shape,
                dtype=dtype,
                name=layer.name + '_input')
            # This will build the current layer
            # and create the node connecting the current layer
            # to the input layer we just created.
            layer(x)
            set_inputs = True
        else:
            raise ValueError('The layer does not know its input shape.')
    
    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
``` 

In the corrected code, a conditional check is added to handle the case where the layer is not an instance of `InputLayer`. If the layer is not an `InputLayer`, it directly raises a `ValueError` indicating that the layer does not know its input shape. This ensures better handling of different layer types and their individual input shape requirements.
