The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` because the 'Dense' object does not have the attribute 'batch_input_shape'. This suggests that the code is trying to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute of a 'Dense' layer, which is not present, leading to the error.

The bug occurs because the code is assuming that the layer has a 'batch_input_shape' attribute without checking the type of the layer. This assumption leads to an error when trying to access the attribute on a layer that doesn't have it.

To fix this bug, the code should first check whether the layer is an instance of 'InputLayer' before attempting to access its 'batch_input_shape' attribute. Additionally, it should handle the case where the layer is a 'Model' or 'Sequential' by recursively checking the nested layers for the 'batch_input_shape' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    self.built = False
    
    if not self._layers:
        set_inputs = False
        
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
            # First, we need to infer the expected input shape and dtype.
            first_layer = layer
            if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                if not layer.layers:
                    raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
                
                # Recover the first layer of the deepest model to infer input shape and dtype.
                while isinstance(first_layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                    first_layer = first_layer.layers[0]
                
                if hasattr(first_layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                    batch_shape = first_layer.batch_input_shape
                    dtype = first_layer.dtype
                    # Instantiate the input layer.
                    x = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
                    layer(x)
                    set_inputs = True
                else:
                    # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
                    batch_shape = None
        else:
            set_inputs = True
        
        if set_inputs:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
            
            self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    elif self.outputs:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    
    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

The corrected code checks for the type of the layer and handles the absence of the 'batch_input_shape' attribute appropriately. This should resolve the `AttributeError` and ensure correct behavior of the `add` method in the `Sequential` class.
