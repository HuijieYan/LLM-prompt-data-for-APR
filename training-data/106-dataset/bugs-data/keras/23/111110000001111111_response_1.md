The bug occurs in the `add` method of the `Sequential` class due to incorrect logic for handling the addition of the layer to the model. The error message provided gives insight into the issues with the sequential model's layer addition.

The bug seems to be caused by the logic that is meant to handle different scenarios when adding layers sequentially. In the provided function, the handling of the first layer or the subsequent layers, with or without knowing the input shape, is causing the bug to occur.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding layers to the sequential model needs to be revised. First, the function should handle the case when adding the first layer, and then handle subsequent layers with or without the input shape known. This involves correctly identifying the input shape, setting inputs, and connecting layers based on this information.

Next, the function should handle the case when adding layers after the first layer, ensuring that the model's input and output layers are updated appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has multiple output tensors.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    try:
        if not self._layers:
            if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                self.build(input_shape=layer.batch_input_shape)
            else:
                self.build()
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError('The added layer does not know its input shape.')

    output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
    if isinstance(output_tensor, (list, tuple)):
        raise ValueError('The added layer has multiple output tensors.')

    self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

In this corrected code, the function first checks if the layer has the batch input shape specified. If so, it uses that information to build the model. If the layer does not have the input shape specified, the model is built without the input shape. After adding the layer, the function updates the model's outputs and appends the layer to the list of layers.
