The bug seems to be related to the check for the first layer in the Sequential model. It tries to infer the input shape and data type for the first layer, but this logic is flawed and leads to incorrect behaviors, particularly when adding subsequent layers.

The issue seems to be related to the condition `if not self._layers`, which is used to identify the first layer in the Sequential model. However, after the first layer is added, this condition may not work as intended for subsequent layers.

To fix this bug, it's important to re-evaluate the logic for identifying the first layer and inferring the input shape and data type. Additionally, the code for setting the inputs and outputs of the model needs to be reviewed to ensure it works correctly when adding subsequent layers.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method in the `Sequential` class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self.outputs:
        # For the first layer, set the inputs
        if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            self.inputs = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
                           ]
            x = self.inputs[0]
            if isinstance(layer, Model):
                x = layer(x)
            self.outputs = [x]
    else:
        # For subsequent layers, connect the output of the previous layer to this layer
        x = self.outputs[0]
        if isinstance(x, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        output_tensor = layer(x)
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    # Add the layer to the list of layers
    self._layers.append(layer)
    self.built = False
```

In this corrected code, we appropriately set the inputs and outputs based on whether it's the first layer being added or a subsequent layer. This ensures that the input shapes and data types are inferred correctly and that subsequent layer addition works as expected.
