The buggy function `add` in the `Sequential` class tries to add a layer instance on top of the layer stack. The error occurs because the logic to infer the input shape and dtype of the layer is not working as expected.

The function tries to determine the input shape and dtype of the layer, and if the layer is the first layer in the model, it tries to create an input tensor and call the layer on the input tensor. However, there is some incorrect logic in the process which results in the error.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to restructure the logic for inferring the input shape and dtype of the layer. This can be done by using the `get_config` function of the layer, which provides information about the layer's configuration, including its input shape and dtype.
2. We should also handle the case when the layer is not the first layer in the model and connect it to the existing inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
        if len(self._layers) == 0:
            self._layers.append(layer)
            self.built = False
            # Create an input tensor
            x = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
            layer(x)
        else:
            # Connect the layer to the existing inputs
            input_tensor = self.outputs[0]
            output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
            self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    else:
        # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
        # We will have to build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
        self._layers.append(layer)
        self.built = False
```

This corrected code handles the case when the layer is the first layer in the model or when it's not. It ensures that the input shape and dtype are correctly inferred and the layer is added to the model accordingly.
