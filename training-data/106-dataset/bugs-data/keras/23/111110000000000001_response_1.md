Potential error location:
The potential error is in the if-else conditions used to handle different cases when adding a layer to the Sequential model.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the logic for adding layers to the Sequential model is not handling all possible cases effectively. This leads to incorrect handling of the input layer and its shape, and also incorrect checking for multi-output layers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Rework the logic for adding layers to properly handle different layer types, input shapes, and multi-output layers.
2. Improve error handling and messaging to provide more informative and accurate error messages.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has multiple output tensors, or is already connected somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if len(self.outputs) > 0:
        raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')

    if len(self._layers) == 0:
        if not hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The first layer added to a Sequential model must know its input shape. Found layer: ' + str(layer))
        inputs = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape)
        layer(inputs)
        self.outputs = [layer.outputs[0]]
        self.inputs = [inputs]
    else:
        output = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output, list):
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output]

    self.built = False
    self._layers.append(layer)
