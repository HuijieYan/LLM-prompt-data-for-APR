The error message indicates that the 'Dense' object does not have the attribute 'batch_input_shape', which is being called at line 152 in the 'add' method of the Sequential class.

It seems that the issue arises when attempting to infer the expected input shape and dtype for the first layer in the model. The 'batch_input_shape' attribute is being accessed from a 'Dense' layer, which does not have this attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to adapt the code to correctly handle the initial layer, ensuring that the input shape and dtype are inferred properly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'add' method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    # Check if the layer is an instance of InputLayer
    if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
        # If it is, set inputs to True and add the layer to self._layers
        set_inputs = True
        self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        # If it's not an input layer, raise an error if it's an empty model
        if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)) and not layer.layers:
            raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
        
        # If it's a model with layers, add the first layer to first_layer
        first_layer = layer.layers[0] if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)) else layer
        
        # Infer the expected input shape and dtype
        # Check if the first_layer has 'batch_input_shape' attribute
        if hasattr(first_layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            batch_shape = first_layer.batch_input_shape
            dtype = first_layer.dtype
            # Instantiate the input layer.
            x = Input(
                batch_shape=batch_shape,
                dtype=dtype,
                name=layer.name + '_input')
            # Add the input layer to self._layers
            self._layers.append(x)
            # This will build the current layer
            # and create the node connecting the current layer
            # to the input layer we just created.
            layer(x)
            set_inputs = True
        else:
            # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
            # We will have to build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
            set_inputs = False
    
    # Update the built status of the model
    self.built = set_inputs
```

This corrected function first checks if the layer is an instance of InputLayer. If it is, it sets the inputs to True and adds the layer to `self._layers`. If it's not an input layer, it then proceeds with the inference of the expected input shape and dtype before updating the built status of the model.
