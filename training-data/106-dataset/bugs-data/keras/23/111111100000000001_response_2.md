The potential error location within the `add` function is where the input layer is being created and connected to the current layer. It seems that the code is trying to infer the input shape and data type, and create the input layer if it doesn't already exist. However, the logic for this process seems to be convoluted and prone to errors.

The bug occurs because the implementation for adding a layer to the stack is overly complex and seems to handle a variety of edge cases. This complexity has led to a situation where the function has become difficult to understand and maintain.

One approach to fixing this bug is to simplify the logic for adding a layer to the stack. Instead of trying to handle all possible edge cases, the function should focus on the core functionality of adding a layer to the stack. If there are specific edge cases that need to be handled, they should be clearly documented and tested separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self._layers:
        # If this is the first layer, create the input layer
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in a Sequential model must be an InputLayer.')
        self.inputs = [layer]
        self.outputs = [layer]
    else:
        # Connect the current layer to the output of the previous layer
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    self._layers.append(layer)
```
