The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` creates two sequential models, `inner_model` and `model`. It then adds `inner_model` to `model` using the `add` method. This triggers the error message, which complains about the `AttributeError: 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'`.

The potential error location is within the `add` method, specifically where `batch_input_shape` is being accessed on the `first_layer`, which is assumed to be an instance of `InputLayer`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code incorrectly assumes that `first_layer` will always have the attribute `batch_input_shape`. This assumption is based on the wrong instance being passed to the `add` method, as the error indicates that a `Dense` layer is being incorrectly treated as an `InputLayer`.

To fix the bug, correct identification of the layer type needs to be enforced so that appropriate actions can be taken based on whether the layer is an `InputLayer` or not. This can be achieved by using the `isinstance` method to determine the type of the `layer` being added.

Here's the corrected `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
