The potential error in the add() function is that it is not properly handling the addition of layers to the Sequential model.

The error occurs because the code does not properly handle the first layer added to the model, especially when it is not an InputLayer. It also does not handle multi-output layers properly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to restructure the code to properly handle the addition of the first layer and multi-output layers. This can involve checking the type of the layer being added, handling the input shape and dtype inference, and ensuring that the Sequential model is built correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the add() function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
        
    if not self._layers:
        if not hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The first layer must know its input shape. '
                             'For instance, it should have batch_input_shape attribute.')
        self.outputs = [layer]
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    
    self._layers.append(layer)
```
