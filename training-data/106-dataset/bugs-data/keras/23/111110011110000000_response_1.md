The code provided is quite complex, and it's not very clear exactly what the intended functionality is. However, the error message suggests that the 'Dense' layer object does not have the attribute 'batch_input_shape'. 

It's also important to note that the code provided for the 'Sequential' class in the `keras/engine/sequential.py` seems to be a part of a larger library and lacks any method for adding layers to a sequential model.

It seems the 'Sequential' class should be initialized with the 'add' function, but the 'add' function itself is not intended for directly adding another sequential model. Instead, it's for adding layers to the current model.

The requested function should aim to add a layer to the model, and the provided code appears to have some unnecessary logic and error handling for the specific case of adding a model. 

The corrected version of the 'Sequential' class should look like

```python
# Class declaration containing the correct function
class Sequential(Model):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add(self, layer):
        """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.
    
        # Arguments
            layer: layer instance.
    
        # Raises
            TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        """
        if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
            raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                            'an instance of class Layer. '
                            'Found: ' + str(layer))
        
        # Add layer to the existing stack
        self.layers.append(layer)
```
In the `add` method, we simply perform the check for the layer type and then append the layer to the existing layers.

This is a simplified version of the `add` function that only checks if the layer is an instance of `Layer` and then appends it to the list of layers in the model.
