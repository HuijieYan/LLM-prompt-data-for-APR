The error occurs when the `inner_model` is added to the `model`. The error message states that there is an AttributeError because the 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'.

The bug is occurring because the `add` method is not correctly handling the case where a `Sequential` model is added as a layer to another `Sequential` model. When the `first_layer` is a `Sequential` model, the `add` method should loop through the layers of the `Sequential` model to retrieve the innermost layer and then get the `batch_input_shape`. Instead, it is directly trying to access `batch_input_shape` on the `Sequential` model instance itself.

To fix the bug in the `add` method, the code should be modified to handle the case when a `Sequential` model is added as a layer to another `Sequential` model. Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        if not layer.layers:
            raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a Sequential model.')
        # Find the innermost layer in the Sequential model
        inner_layer = layer
        while isinstance(inner_layer, Sequential):
            inner_layer = inner_layer.layers[0]
        batch_shape = inner_layer.batch_input_shape
    else:
        batch_shape = layer.batch_input_shape
    if batch_shape is None:
        # Handle the case where the layer doesn't know its expected shape
        # We will have to build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
        first_layer = True
    else:
        first_layer = False
        # Instantiate the input layer
        x = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
        layer(x)
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    self.built = False
    if first_layer:
        set_inputs = False
    else:
        set_inputs = True
        if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '
                             'For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case when a `Sequential` model is added as a layer to another `Sequential` model by finding the innermost layer in the added `Sequential` model, retrieving the `batch_input_shape`, and creating an input layer accordingly. Then, we continue with the original logic of the `add` method.
