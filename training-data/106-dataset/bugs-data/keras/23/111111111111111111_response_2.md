The error occurs due to the 'Dense' layer being passed as the first layer to 'model.add(inner_model)', resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access 'batch_input_shape' since 'Dense' layer objects do not have that attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'add' function in the 'Sequential' class such that it handles the addition of nested models correctly by checking if the passed layer is an instance of 'Sequential'. If so, it should build the model before adding it to the layer stack.

Here's the corrected 'add' function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        # Build the model before adding it
        layer.build()
    elif not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    self.built = False

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    # ...
```

With this correction, the 'add' function now handles the addition of nested models correctly and avoids the AttributeError previously encountered.
