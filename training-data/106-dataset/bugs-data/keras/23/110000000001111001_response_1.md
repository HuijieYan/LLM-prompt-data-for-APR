The potential error in this function is that it's not properly handling the case where the input layer is a Sequential model. This is causing issues when adding layers to the Sequential model.

The bug occurs when the function is trying to handle different types of layers, including the Sequential model, but it's not doing it correctly. This causes the function to incorrectly handle adding layers, resulting in errors.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the input layer is a Sequential model. This involves checking if the layer is an instance of `Sequential`, and if so, handling it appropriately to get the input shape and dtype.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False

    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        if not layer.layers:
            raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
        
        input_layer = layer.layers[0]
        while isinstance(input_layer, Sequential):
            input_layer = input_layer.layers[0]
        batch_shape = input_layer.input_shape
        dtype = input_layer.dtype
    else:
        batch_shape = layer.input_shape
        dtype = layer.dtype

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the case where the layer is an instance of `Sequential`. We extract the input shape and dtype from the first layer of the Sequential model and use that to set the `batch_shape` and `dtype`. This ensures that the input layer is handled correctly and avoids the errors that were occurring.
