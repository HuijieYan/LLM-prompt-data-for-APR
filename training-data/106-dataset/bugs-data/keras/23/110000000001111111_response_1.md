The bug in the provided function is that it is unable to handle specific layers and their input shapes properly. It also has issues with checking the outputs of layers.

To fix this bug, there needs to be proper handling of different layer types such as InputLayer and Dense. Additionally, there should be proper checks for the number of output tensors and setting the inputs and outputs accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    from keras.engine import Layer, InputLayer, Input
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    if self.outputs:
        raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')

    if not self._layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            input_shape = layer.input_shape
            if input_shape is None:
                raise ValueError('The first layer in the Sequential model must have an input shape specified.')
        else:
            input_shape = layer.input_shape
        self.outputs = [layer]
        self.inputs = [Input(shape=input_shape)]
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    self.built = True
    self._layers.append(layer)
```
