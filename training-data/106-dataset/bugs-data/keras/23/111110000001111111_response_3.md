The bug in the code arises when the `add` method of the `Sequential` class is called. This method is used to add a layer instance to the model but has several issues:

1. The check for whether the model has been built (`self.built`) is not sufficient to ensure that the input shape of the layer is known. It only checks whether the model has been built or not.

2. There is an inconsistency in the assignment of `self._layers`. It is assigned to a new list when `self._layers` is empty, but when `self._layers` is not empty, a new layer is simply appended to the list, without any input shape checks.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to perform the following steps:

1. Update the code to check if the input shape of the layer is known before modifying `self._layers`.

2. If the input shape is unknown, it should be inferred based on the previous layer or specified by the user, similar to the behavior described in the comments of the original code.

3. Implement a check to ensure that when a layer is being added, it has only a single output tensor. If not, it should raise a `ValueError`.

4. Update the `self._layers` based on the conditions above.

The corrected code for the `add` method is as follows:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self.built:
        if self._layers:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '
                                 'For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self._layers.append(layer)
    else:  # model has been built
        raise RuntimeError('Model needs to be compiled before adding layers')
```
