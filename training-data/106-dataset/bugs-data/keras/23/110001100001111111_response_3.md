Potential Error Location:
The lines of code where the error occurs are:
- `layer(x)`: This is likely causing the issue when calling the layer on the input tensor.
- `output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])`: This line could be problematic as well.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `add` in the `Sequential` class is not handling the addition of layers correctly. It fails to properly handle the logic for adding and building layers within the Sequential model. This results in the incorrect addition of layers and the failure to infer the input shape and data type, leading to TypeError and ValueError being raised.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The function should handle the addition of layers according to the Sequential model's requirements, ensuring the input shape and data type are correctly inferred when adding layers. Additionally, it should properly build the model before returning.

2. It should check for multi-output tensors and ensure that all layers have a single output tensor.

3. The function should also differentiate between the first layer and subsequent layers, handling the input layer creation and connecting layers properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
