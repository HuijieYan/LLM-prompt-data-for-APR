The error occurs when trying to add an inner model to the outer model. The error message indicates that the 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'. This suggests that the code is incorrectly attempting to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute from a 'Dense' layer.

The bug occurs in the `add` method of the `Sequential` class. The method incorrectly infers the expected input shape and dtype when dealing with nested models. Specifically, it tries to extract the `batch_input_shape` from the layer, assuming it's an instance of `InputLayer`, but it does not handle the case where the layer is an instance of `Dense`. As a result, it raises an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where the layer is an instance of `Dense` differently. We can obtain the input shape and dtype from `Dense` using its `input_shape` and `dtype` attributes, respectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.
    
    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.
    
    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
