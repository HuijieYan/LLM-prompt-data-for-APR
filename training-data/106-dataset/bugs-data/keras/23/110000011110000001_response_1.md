The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build()` aims to add an inner sequential model `inner_model` to an outer sequential model `model`. The bug occurs when the `model.add(inner_model)` statement is executed. It triggers the `batch_input_shape` AttributeError within the `add` method of the `Sequential` class, attempting to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute from a `Dense` layer object, which leads to the error.

The bug occurs because the `add` method does not handle the case where the layer being added is a model instance itself. The method is not equipped to handle model instances as input layers directly and tries to access attributes that are not present in the `Dense` layer object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `add` method to handle nested model instances properly. This can be achieved by checking if the layer being added is an instance of a model. If so, we need to handle it differently by retrieving the first layer within the model, checking for the input shape and dtype, and then adding it to the sequential model.

The corrected `add` method is as follows:

```python
from keras.engine.topology import Layer, InputLayer

def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, keras.models.Sequential):
        # Handle sequential model being added
        if not layer.layers:
            raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
        first_layer = layer.layers[0]
        while isinstance(first_layer, keras.models.Sequential):
            first_layer = first_layer.layers[0]
        
        if not hasattr(first_layer, 'input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The layer does not know its expected input shape.')

        if not first_layer._inbound_nodes:
            x = Input(shape=first_layer.input_shape[1:])
            layer(x)
            # Add the inner model's layers to the outer model
            for inner_layer in layer.layers:
                self._layers.append(inner_layer)
        else:
            raise ValueError('The layer is already connected somewhere else.')
    else:
        # Handle regular layer being added
        if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
            raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
        
        # Rest of the method to handle adding non-model layers
```

In the corrected method, we specifically handle the case when a sequential model instance is being added by retrieving the first layer and checking its input shape before proceeding with the addition. We also raise appropriate errors if the input model does not meet the necessary conditions.
