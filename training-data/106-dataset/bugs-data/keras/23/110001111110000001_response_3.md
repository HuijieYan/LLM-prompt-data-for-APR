The test case is trying to create a nested sequential model by adding an inner model to an outer model. However, the error occurs when trying to access the attribute 'batch_input_shape' from the 'Dense' layer.

The bug is in the function `add` in the provided code. The loop to set the `batch_shape` for the first layer is incorrect, as it assumes that the layer has the attribute `batch_input_shape`, which is specific to certain types of layers like `InputLayer`.

The error occurs because the `Dense` layer does not have a `batch_input_shape` attribute.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where a new layer is added to the sequential model. It should create an input tensor based on the shape of the output from the previous layer.

Below is the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ', layer)

    if self.outputs:
        output_shape = self.outputs[0]._keras_shape
        if len(output_shape) == 2:
            input_shape = (output_shape[-1],)
        else:
            input_shape = output_shape[1:]

        x = Input(shape=input_shape)
        layer(x)
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(x)
    else:
        if not self._layers:
            set_inputs = False
            first_layer = layer
            if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                if not layer.layers:
                    raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')

                first_layer = layer.layers[0]
                while isinstance(first_layer, (Model, Sequential)):
                    first_layer = first_layer.layers[0]

            input_shape = first_layer.compute_output_shape((None,) + first_layer.output_shape[1:])

            x = Input(shape=input_shape[1:])
            layer(x)
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(x)
    
    self.built = False
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

This corrected code creates an input tensor based on the output shape of the previous layer and sets it as the input for the new layer to be added. This should resolve the issue and allow the nested sequential model to be constructed properly.
