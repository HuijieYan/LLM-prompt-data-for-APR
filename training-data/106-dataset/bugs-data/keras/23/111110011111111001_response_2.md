The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` creates a nested sequential model, adds layers to it, and then compiles the model. The error occurs when adding `inner_model` to `model`. This triggers the `add` method of the `Sequential` class to be executed.

The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'. This suggests that the code is attempting to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute from a Dense layer, which is not a valid attribute for Dense layers.

The bug occurs in the `Sequential.add` method when trying to infer the input shape and dtype for the layers being added. It incorrectly assumes that the first layer is always an instance of InputLayer and tries to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute. This causes an AttributeError when the layer is a Dense layer.

To fix the bug, the `add` method needs to be modified to handle the case when the first layer is a Dense layer. Instead of inferring the input shape and dtype from the layer, it should wait until the build phase to perform this inference.

Here's the corrected code for the `Sequential.add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    if not self.outputs:
        if not hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in the model must have '
                             'an attribute `batch_input_shape`.')
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

In the corrected code, the input shape and dtype inference is deferred until the build phase of the model. The method now simply appends the layer to the list of layers without attempting to infer the input shape and dtype. The actual inference will be done during model building when it is needed.
