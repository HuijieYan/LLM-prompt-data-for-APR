Potential error location:
The potential error location is where the function checks if the layer argument is an instance of InputLayer. This check also includes making sure that the layer has only one output tensor.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for an instance of InputLayer and ensuring there is only one output tensor. This is not necessary for the add function in a Sequential model.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The add function should simply add the provided layer to the layer stack without the need to check for an InputLayer or single output tensor.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected add function
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    self.built = False
    if not self.outputs:
        if not self.inputs:
            # If no input is set, the added layer will become input layer.
            self.set_inputs(layer)
        
        self.outputs = [layer]
    elif self.outputs:
        self.outputs = [layer]

    if not self.inputs:
        self.set_inputs(layer)
```
