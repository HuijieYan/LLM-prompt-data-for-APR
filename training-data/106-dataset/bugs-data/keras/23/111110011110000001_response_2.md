The error occurs at the `model.add(inner_model)` line in the test function. The buggy function is `add` in the `Sequential` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `batch_input_shape`.

The bug occurs because the `add` function assumes that the layer added to the model knows its input shape. However, in this case, the layer added is a nested sequential model, which is not a layer with a known input shape. This results in the AttributeError when attempting to access `batch_input_shape` on the `Dense` layer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function to handle the case where the layer being added is a nested sequential model and does not have a known input shape. This can be done by checking the type of the layer being added and handling it appropriately.

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        # For nested sequential models, add all the layers in the nested model to the current model
        for nested_layer in layer.layers:
            self.add(nested_layer)
    else:
        if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
            raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                            'an instance of class Layer. '
                            'Found: ' + str(layer))
        self.built = False
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, if the layer being added is a nested sequential model, all the layers within the nested model will be added to the current model. Otherwise, the function will proceed as usual.
