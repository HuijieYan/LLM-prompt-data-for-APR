The error message indicates that there is an assertion error occurring within the `MinimalRNNCell` build method. The assertion checks if the length of the `input_shape` is 2, which means it should have two dimensions. However, the input shape being passed has 3 dimensions instead, resulting in the assertion error.

The bug is likely happening within the `RNN` cell processing part, which leads to an input shape with 3 dimensions being passed to the `MinimalRNNCell` build method. This could be due to an incorrect manipulation of the input shape within the `build` method of the `RNN` cell.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input shape passed to the `MinimalRNNCell` build method is 2-dimensional. This can be achieved by modifying the `build` method in the `RNN` cell to correctly handle the input shape to make sure it has the correct dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.input_spec = [InputSpec(shape=input_shape)]
    input_shape = input_shape.as_list()
    if len(input_shape) != 3:
        raise ValueError('Input should have 3 dimensions.')
    self.input_dim = input_shape[2]
    self.states = [None]
    step_input_shape = (input_shape[0],) + input_shape[2:]
    self.cell.build(step_input_shape)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we enforce the input shape to have 3 dimensions, and then extract the relevant dimensions before passing it to the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell`.
