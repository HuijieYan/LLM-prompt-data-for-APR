Potential error location: The code inside the for loop seems to be incorrectly checking for the state_size attribute of the cell.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')` is checking if the `state_size` attribute of the cell is iterable. However, it should be checking if the `cell` object itself is an instance of a type that has a `state_size` attribute. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We should check if the `cell` is an instance of a type that has a `state_size` attribute, and then check if the `state_size` attribute is iterable. Additionally, we should handle the case where `state_size` is a tuple differently from the case where it is an integer.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, RNNCell) or isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
