Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the line "if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):", as it is trying to check the length of the state size attribute of the cell.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the state_size attribute of the cell, but it is not implemented correctly. Additionally, the code is not handling the case where cell.state_size does not have a length.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to use a try-except block to handle the cases where cell.state_size is not implemented as expected. Another approach is to check if cell.state_size is a list or tuple before trying to access its length.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        try:
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        except (TypeError, IndexError):  # Handle the case where cell.state_size is not implemented as expected
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
