The error occurs when the input_shape has a length of 3 instead of the expected length of 2. This happens due to the manipulation of the input_shape inside the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class.

To fix the bug, we need to update the build method to correctly handle the input_shape for each cell. In addition, the inputs and their states should be passed to the cell's call method to get the correct output.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.cell_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected implementation:
- We store the original input_shape as `self.cell_input_shape` to be reused.
- Inside the loop, we update `input_shape` by removing the time axis and replacing it with the size of the cell's state.
- Finally, we set `self.built` to True.

With these changes, the `build` method will correctly handle the input_shape for each cell and remove the dimension mismatch issue seen in the error message.
