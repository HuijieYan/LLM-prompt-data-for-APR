The potential error in the function is how the input_shape is being updated. It seems that the function is trying to update the input_shape based on the state_size of the cells, but the logic is not handling the state_size correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the state_size of the cells when updating the input_shape. The current implementation checks if the state_size has a length, and if not, it assigns output_dim directly from cell.state_size. This could lead to incorrect dimensions being assigned to the input_shape.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to properly handle the state_size of the cells and update the input_shape accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the build function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, list):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the cell has a 'state_size' attribute before trying to access it. Then we check if the state_size is a list, and if so, we assign the first element to output_dim. Otherwise, we directly assign the state_size to output_dim. This will ensure that the input_shape is updated correctly based on the state_size of the cells.
