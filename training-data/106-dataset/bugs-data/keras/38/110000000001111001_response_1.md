The potential error in the given function is in the if condition `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):`, as it is checking the length of `cell.state_size` without considering if `cell` has a `state_size` attribute.

The bug occurred because the attribute `state_size` is not present in all `self.cells`. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `if` condition to check if the `state_size` attribute exists for the cell object before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
