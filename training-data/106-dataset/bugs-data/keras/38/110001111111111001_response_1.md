The error occurs when the function `build` is called in the test case `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer`. The function `build` is defined within the `MinimalRNNCell` class which inherits from `keras.layers.Layer`. This `build` function checks if the length of the input shape is 2, and it fails because the length is 3 in the failing test case as shown in the error message: `assert len(input_shape) == 2`.

The reason behind this bug is that the input shape `input_shape` should be modified within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class in the `keras/layers/recurrent.py` file. Currently, the method modifies `input_shape` with respect to the state size of a single cell only, not considering the stacked cells.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should loop through all cells within `self.cells`, and for each cell, update the `input_shape` based on the state size of that cell. The final `input_shape` should be updated to accommodate the state sizes of all stacked cells.

The corrected code for the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This modification ensures that the `input_shape` is correctly updated for each stacked cell, taking into account the state size of each cell.
