The error message indicates an assertion error in the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class. The error occurs at line 521 of the test function where the input_shape has a length of 3 instead of 2, as expected by the assertion.

The bug likely occurs in the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class. The input_shape is being updated in the given buggy method for each cell, which is leading to an incorrect input shape in the subsequent iteration of the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input_shape is not updated in each iteration, and the calculation of output_dim and the subsequent transformation of input_shape should not overwrite the original input_shape variable.

Here's the corrected code for the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
    output_dim = self.cells[-1].state_size
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the input_shape is not updated in each iteration. The output_dim is calculated based on the state size of the last cell in the list, and then input_shape is updated accordingly. This should resolve the issue and prevent the input_shape from being improperly modified.
