The error is occurring in the `build` function of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. This error is happening because the `assert len(input_shape) == 2` condition is failing. This condition is meant to ensure that the input shape has only two dimensions, but it's failing because the input shape is actually a 3D tensor, as indicated by the error message `input_shape = (None, 5, 8)`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `build` function to handle 3D input shapes. The correction involves removing the assertion for the input shape and modifying the code to handle 3D input shapes.

Below is the corrected `build` function for the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This corrected code removes the assertion for the input shape and builds the kernel and recurrent kernel weights based on the last dimension of the input shape.
