The potential error in the given function is in the way the `output_dim` and `input_shape` are being updated inside the for loop. 

The `output_dim` is being updated based on the `state_size` of the cell, and then the `input_shape` is being updated based on the `output_dim`. However, the logic to update the `input_shape` seems incorrect, as it directly replaces the first two dimensions of `input_shape` with the same values and updates the third dimension with `output_dim`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `input_shape` for each cell based on its `output_dim`. This can be achieved by updating the first two dimensions of `input_shape` with the same values and updating the third dimension with the `output_dim` of the current cell inside the loop.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This corrected function will properly update the `input_shape` for each cell based on its `output_dim`.
