The error occurs when the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is called within the test function. The error message indicates that the input shape is not in the expected format, causing an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class assumes that the input shape has a length of 2, which is not true in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `build` method should be modified to handle input shapes with a length greater than 2. This can be achieved by considering the shape of the input and adjusting the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # handle input shapes with a length greater than 2
    if len(input_shape) > 2:
        input_shape = input_shape[1:]  # ignore the time dimension
    # rest of the build method remains the same
    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

This modification will handle input shapes with a length greater than 2 and prevent the assertion error from occurring.
