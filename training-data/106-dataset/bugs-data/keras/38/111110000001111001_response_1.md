The bug in the `build` function arises from the fact that `self.cells` is being iterated over without being defined within the scope of the `build` function. Additionally, `cell` is being used without being defined within the function. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.cells` is defined within the scope of the `build` function, and also define `cell` before using it within the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
