The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The error message indicates that the input_shape has a length of 3, but the method asserts that it should be equal to 2.

This discrepancy is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of the input_shape when iterating through the cells in the `build` method. It seems that the method is assuming a certain structure of the input_shape while processing each cell, leading to the assertion error.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the input_shape for each cell. Additionally, it's important to consider the shape of the input and output for each cell to ensure they are compatible.

Here's the corrected `build` method for the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            input_shape = cell.compute_output_shape(input_shape)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cell is not an instance of Layer")
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the `build` method iterates through each cell in the list and checks if it is an instance of `Layer` before calling `build` and updating the `input_shape` for the next cell. This ensures that the input_shape is correctly handled for each cell and eliminates the assertion error.
