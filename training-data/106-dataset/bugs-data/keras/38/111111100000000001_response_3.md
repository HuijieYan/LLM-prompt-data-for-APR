Potential Error:
The error occurs in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The loop inside the `build` method is trying to iterate over the cells, but it is not handling the cell's `state_size` attribute correctly.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `state_size` attribute of the cell is not being accessed properly. It is trying to check if `cell.state_size` has a length (`__len__`) attribute, but this check is not being performed correctly.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to handle the `state_size` attribute of the cell properly to determine the output dimension.

Corrected Code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
