The error occurs in the function `build` of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The issue seems to be related to the input shape not having the expected format. The code assumes the input shape should only have 2 dimensions, but in the error message, it is shown to have 3 dimensions: `(None, 5, 8)`.

This is happening because the `MinimalRNNCell` class is creating input shapes with an additional dimension (in this case, 8), which causes the assertion error in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class.

To fix the bug, the `build` function in the `StackedRNNCells` class needs to be updated to be more flexible with the input shape. It should not assume a specific shape and should be able to handle input shapes with any number of dimensions. In this case, it should handle input shapes with 3 dimensions as well.

Here's the corrected code with comments to indicate the changes:

```python
# corrected build function
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        # Assume `cell` has a `build` method
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)

        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        # Update input shape to include the output_dim
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        
    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the `build` function will now handle input shapes with any number of dimensions, ensuring that the assertion error is resolved.
