The problem in the given function is that it is trying to access the state size of each cell in a loop, but it is not handling the case where cell.state_size is a list. It only considers the case where cell.state_size is not a list.

To fix this, we can modify the function to handle both cases where cell.state_size is a single value or a list of values.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]  # consider the first state size if it's a list
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

With this modification, the function will check if `cell.state_size` has a length. If it does, it will use the first value in the list as the `output_dim`, otherwise, it will use `cell.state_size` directly. This will handle both cases properly.
