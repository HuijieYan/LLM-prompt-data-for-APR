The potential error location within the provided function is in the if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):`, specifically with the use of `hasattr` to check if `cell.state_size` has a length.

The bug is occurring because the `hasattr` function is being used to check if `cell.state_size` has a length, but `cell.state_size` can be a single value or a tuple. The `hasattr` function checks if an object has a given attribute, it doesn't check the length of an attribute that is a tuple or a list.

To fix the bug, we can use the `isinstance` function to check if `cell.state_size` is a tuple or list, and then proceed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
