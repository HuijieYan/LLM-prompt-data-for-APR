Potential error location: The error might be in the way the output_dim is calculated inside the for loop.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the calculation of output_dim is incorrect, and it might not consider the appropriate state_size of the cell.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the cell has a state_size attribute before attempting to access it.
2. If the state_size is a list, then access the first element (state_size[0]) as the output_dim.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            state_size = cell.state_size
            if hasattr(state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
