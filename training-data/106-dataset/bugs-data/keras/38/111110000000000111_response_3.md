Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the `build` function of the `StackedRNNCells` class.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `build` function is not correctly handling the `state_size` attribute of the RNN cells. The function is trying to access the `state_size` attribute of each cell without properly handling cases where it may be a list or a single value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by properly handling the `state_size` attribute of each cell. This can be done by checking whether it is a list or a single value, and then accessing the appropriate value.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
