Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring in the section where the output_dim is being calculated, as it directly affects the input_shape for the next iteration.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug may be occurring because the code does not handle the different types of cells provided in self.cells, and it does not consider the state_size of each cell properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the type of cell and handle it accordingly.
2. Calculate the output_dim based on the type of cell and its state_size.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            state_size = cell.state_size
            if isinstance(state_size, (list, tuple)):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
