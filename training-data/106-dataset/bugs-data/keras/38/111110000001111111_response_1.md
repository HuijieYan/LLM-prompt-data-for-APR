The issue with the `build` function seems to be that the `output_dim` is being incorrectly calculated. The function is iterating through each cell, and for each cell, it is updating the `input_shape` variable, but it is not correctly aggregating the `output_dim` from each cell.

To fix this, we need to calculate the maximum `output_dim` from all cells and then update the `input_shape` accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    max_output_dim = 0
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        if output_dim > max_output_dim:
            max_output_dim = output_dim
    input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], max_output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected code, we introduced a `max_output_dim` variable to keep track of the maximum output dimension from all cells. We then update `input_shape` only after calculating the maximum `output_dim`. This should fix the bug and ensure that `input_shape` is correctly updated based on the maximum output dimension of the cells.
