The error message is coming from the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class, specifically the line `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. This assertion is failing because the input shape is actually `(None, 5, 8)`, which has a length of 3, not 2.

The bug in the `build` method of the main function is likely related to how the `input_shape` is being modified within the loop that iterates over the cells. It seems that the manipulation of `input_shape` inside the loop is causing the shape to change in a way that triggers the assertion failure in the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the manipulation of `input_shape` preserves its structure so that it doesn't violate the assumptions made by the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    processed_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(processed_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        processed_input_shape = (processed_input_shape[0], processed_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the `input_shape` is preserved as `processed_input_shape`, and this processed input shape is updated as we iterate over the cells. This ensures that the original `input_shape` is not modified, addressing the bug and preventing the assertion failure in the `MinimalRNNCell` class.
