The bug in the code appears to be in the `build` method of the StackedRNNCells class. The problem arises from the loop that iterates over the cells and modifies the input_shape. 

The issue is that in the loop, the `input_shape` is being modified for each `cell` in `self.cells`, which results in incorrect handling of the `input_shape` for subsequent cells.

To fix the bug, we should create a new variable to store the modified input_shape for each cell iteration, and then update the `input_shape` variable at the end after all cells have been processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    modified_input_shape = input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(modified_input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        modified_input_shape = (modified_input_shape[0], modified_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
    # Update the original input_shape after all cells have been processed
    input_shape = modified_input_shape
```

This modification ensures that the `input_shape` is correctly updated after all cells have been processed, preventing issues with subsequent cells using incorrect input shapes.
