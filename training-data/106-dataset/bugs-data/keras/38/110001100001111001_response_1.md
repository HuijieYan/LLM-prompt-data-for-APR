The error in the code is likely in the loop that iterates over the cells and attempts to build them. The bug seems to be related to how the 'cell' object is being used within the loop.

The bug occurs because the code is attempting to access the state_size attribute of the 'cell' object without checking if it exists first. Additionally, the input_shape variable is being modified inside the loop, which may lead to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the 'cell' object has the 'state_size' attribute before trying to use it. This will prevent errors when the attribute is not available. Additionally, it's a good practice to avoid modifying the input_shape variable inside the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
