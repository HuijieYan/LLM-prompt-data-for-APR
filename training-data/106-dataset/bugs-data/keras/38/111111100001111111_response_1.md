The bug occurs in the build function of the StackedRNNCells class. This function is designed to iterate through the cells and update the input_shape based on the state_size of each cell. However, the bug occurs because the code is incorrectly trying to access the state_size of a cell by calling cell.state_size directly, which results in a AttributeError as it is not a direct attribute of the cell object.

To fix this, we can modify the code to check if the cell has a state_size attribute and handle it accordingly. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        self.built = True
```

This modification includes an additional check using hasattr to verify if the cell object has the state_size attribute before attempting to access it. This should resolve the AttributeError that was occurring.
