The buggy function is `build(self, input_shape)` inside the `StackedRNNCells` class. It appears that the function is trying to build each cell in the `cells` list and set the `output_dim` based on the cell's `state_size`. However, there are multiple build functions defined, and the existing code does not handle the cell's state size correctly.

The code is trying to access the `state_size` attribute of each `cell` and define the `output_dim` based on it. However, the code should be checking if `cell` has a `state_size` attribute and then accessing it if it exists.

To fix this, the code should be modified to check if `cell` has the attribute `state_size` and then access its value. Additionally, the `output_dim` should be modified based on whether `cell.state_size` is iterable or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            state_size = cell.state_size
            if hasattr(state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
