Potential error location: 
The potential error occurs in the if statement `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__')`, where it is trying to check if `cell.state_size` is iterable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code is trying to check if `cell.state_size` is iterable using the `hasattr` function, but it is not properly handling the case where `cell.state_size` is not iterable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `cell.state_size` is iterable using `isinstance` instead of `hasattr`.
2. Handle the case where `cell.state_size` is not iterable separately.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if isinstance(cell.state_size, (list, tuple)) and len(cell.state_size) > 0:
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    
    self.built = True
```
