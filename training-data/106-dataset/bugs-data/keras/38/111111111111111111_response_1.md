The potential error location within the problematic function is the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2`. The input_shape is being asserted to have a length of 2, which is causing the assertion error. The input_shape provided to the build method has a length of 3 `(None, 5, 8)`, so this assertion is incorrect.

To fix this bug, you should remove the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the build method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
