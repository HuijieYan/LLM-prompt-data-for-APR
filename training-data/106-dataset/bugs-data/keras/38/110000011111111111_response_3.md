The error occurs in the build method of the MinimalRNNCell class. The issue arises because the shape of the input is checked to have a length of 2, but the actual shape passed in the failing test cases has a length of 3.

To fix this bug, the build method should be updated to handle input shapes with a length of 3. This can be achieved by updating the conditional check to handle both 2D and 3D input shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the MinimalRNNCell class:

```python
    def build(self, input_shape):
        if len(input_shape) < 2 or len(input_shape) > 3:
            raise ValueError('Input shape should be a 2D or 3D tensor.')

        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True
```

Additionally, the build method provided at the beginning of the question seems to be a part of the StackedRNNCells class. Assuming that the build method is meant to handle input shape building for the StackedRNNCells, here is the corrected version:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        if len(input_shape) == 3:
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        elif len(input_shape) == 2:
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
