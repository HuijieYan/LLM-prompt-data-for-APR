The error message indicates that the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` is failing because the input_shape is (None, 5, 8), leading to a length of 3 instead of the expected 2. This indicates that the error is likely in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class.

The reason for this bug is that the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` is not handling the input_shape properly. It assumes that the input_shape will always have a length of 2, but in this particular instance, it has a length of 3.

To fix this bug, the `build` method should correctly handle input_shape of arbitrary length.

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) >= 2

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected version, the assertion `assert len(input_shape) >= 2` is used to handle input_shape of arbitrary length. This will allow the build method to work for input_shape with different dimensions.
