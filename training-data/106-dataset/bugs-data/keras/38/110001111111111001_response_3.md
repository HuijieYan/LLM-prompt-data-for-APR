The error occurs in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The `build` method is expecting the input shape to have a length of 2, but in the provided test case, the input shape has a length of 3.

The bug occurs because the input shape being passed to the `build` method has a time axis (which makes the length of the shape 3) while the `build` method expects the input shape without a time axis (i.e., the length of the shape should be 2).

To fix the bug, the `build` method should be modified to handle the input shape correctly, taking into account the time axis which adds an additional dimension.

```python
# corrected build method
def build(self, input_shape):
    # dimension of input_shape should be >= 2 to account for time axis
    assert len(input_shape) >= 2

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In the corrected method, the assertion is modified to check if the input shape has at least 2 dimensions, accounting for the time axis. This will handle the input shapes correctly and resolve the bug.
