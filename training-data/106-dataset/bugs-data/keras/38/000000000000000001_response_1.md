Potential error location: The if statement checking for the length of cell.state_size could result in an error if cell.state_size is not a list or tuple.

Reason for the bug: The code does not handle the case where cell.state_size is not a list or tuple, resulting in a potential AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can add a check to ensure cell.state_size has a len attribute before trying to access it.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
