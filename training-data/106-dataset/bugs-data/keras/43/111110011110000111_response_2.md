The error message indicates that the shape of the one_hot variable is different from the expected shape. The expected shape is (3, 5) but the actual shape is (3, 1, 5). This suggests that the to_categorical function is not reshaping the output correctly.

The potential error location within the to_categorical function is the reshaping step. The line "categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)" could be the source of the problem.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the categorical matrix is not performed correctly. The shape should be modified to include the num_classes dimension at the end of the shape tuple to align the expected output shape with the actual output shape.

The approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the reshaping step correctly adds the num_classes dimension at the end of the shape tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the to_categorical function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With this corrected function, the reshaping step correctly adds the num_classes dimension at the end of the shape tuple, ensuring that the output shape aligns with the expected shape.
