The test case defines `num_classes` as 5, and it has various shapes like (3,), (4, 3), (5, 4, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2, 1). It then calculates the expected shapes for the converted categorical data based on these shapes and the number of classes. Finally, it compares the calculated shape with the expected shape and fails with an assertion error due to a mismatch in shapes.

The identified potential issue within the problematic function is when reshaping the array to represent the categorical data.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the categorical array is not done correctly. The mismatch in shape dimensions is caused by not properly handling the reshaping of the categorical array to the expected output_shape.

To fix this bug, the reshaping of the categorical array should be done without adding an additional dimension if the shape is already consistent with the expected output_shape. Only perform reshaping when necessary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
        
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    
    # Perform reshaping only if necessary
    if len(y.shape) == 1:
        output_shape = (n, num_classes)
    else:
        output_shape = y.shape + (num_classes,)
    
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With this corrected function, the reshaping only happens when the shape of the input array requires it. Now the test should pass without any assertion errors.
