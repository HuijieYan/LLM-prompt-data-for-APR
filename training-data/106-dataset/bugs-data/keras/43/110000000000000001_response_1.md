Potential error location: 
The error occurs in the line where it tries to reshape the categorical array to include the number of classes. The output_shape is being calculated using only the input_shape and the number of classes, which causes the error.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the output_shape. The function fails to correctly calculate the output shape of the categorical array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by using the correct dimensions to calculate the output_shape of the categorical array. This can be done by accounting for the batch size, the number of classes, and the input shape dimensions.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], num_classes) if len(input_shape) > 1 else (input_shape[0], num_classes)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
