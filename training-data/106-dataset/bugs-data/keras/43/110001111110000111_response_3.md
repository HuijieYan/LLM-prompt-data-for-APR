The test case is testing the `to_categorical` function with various input shapes and expected output shapes. The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape.

The potential error location is within the `to_categorical` function, specifically in the calculation of the `output_shape`. It seems that the logic for reshaping the categorical array is incorrect.

The bug occurred because the calculation of the `output_shape` was not matching the expected shape. This may be due to an incorrect calculation when adding the extra dimension for the num_classes.

To fix the bug, we need to calculate the `output_shape` correctly based on the input shape and the number of classes. Then, reshape the `categorical` array accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

In the corrected code, the `output_shape` is calculated by adding a tuple (num_classes,) to the `input_shape`. This ensures that the output is reshaped correctly to match the expected shape.
