The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when comparing the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function with the expected shape. The error message specifies that the actual shape is (3, 1, 5) when it should be (3, 5).

The potential error location in the function is when reshaping the categorical array. It seems that the reshaping logic might not be handling the input shapes and the number of classes correctly.

The bug occurs because the reshaping logic is not correctly accounting for the input shapes, resulting in an incorrect output shape.

To fix the bug, the reshaping logic needs to be modified to consider the original input shape and correctly add the dimension for the number of classes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    categorical = np.zeros((y.size, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(y.size), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
