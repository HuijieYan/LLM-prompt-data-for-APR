The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the to_categorical function does not match the expected shape. This is likely due to the reshaping logic inside the to_categorical function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the reshape operation. This can lead to the misaligned shapes and cause the function to output an incorrect shape.

The bug occurs because the reshape operation was not performed correctly, leading to an incorrect shape for the output.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use numpy's reshape function correctly to ensure that the reshaping is done in a way that aligns with the expected output shape.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    n = y.shape[0]
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
```
