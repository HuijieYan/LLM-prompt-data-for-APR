Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1` where it tries to index the `categorical` array using `y`.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is likely due to indexing the `categorical` array using `y`, which might be causing an error due to mismatched dimensions or incorrect indexing.

Approach for fixing the bug: We can use one-hot encoding to convert the class vector `y` to a binary class matrix. This can be achieved using the `keras.utils.to_categorical` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

```python
from keras.utils import to_categorical

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    return to_categorical(y, num_classes)
```
