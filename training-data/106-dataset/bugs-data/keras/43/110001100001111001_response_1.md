The potential error in the given function is in the reshaping operation to convert the 'categorical' array from a 2D matrix to a 3D matrix. This reshaping is causing the function to return a matrix with the incorrect dimensions and values.

The reason behind this bug is that the reshaping operation is not performed correctly, leading to incorrect dimensions for the output matrix.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the reshaping operation is performed in a way that correctly represents the original data. We can achieve this by performing the reshaping after the array is created, using the 'reshape' method instead of directly passing the output shape to 'np.reshape'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'to_categorical' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = categorical.reshape(output_shape)
    return categorical
```
