Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the line `n = y.shape[0]` since `y` is a 1D array and `y.shape` will return a single value (length of the array) rather than a tuple.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is assuming `y` to be a 2D array when calculating the value of `n`. As a result, the shape attribute is not returning the expected result, leading to an error in the subsequent lines of code.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to change the way we calculate the value of `n` to account for the fact that `y` is a 1D array.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.size
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
