The bug in the provided function `to_categorical` lies in the shape of the `categorical` array. The function is failing to reshape `categorical` properly.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the `categorical` array is not done using appropriate dimensions. For example, in the third buggy case, `categorical` is reshaped to a shape of `(5, 4, 3, 5)` instead of the expected shape of `(5, 4, 3, 5)`.

To fix the bug, the reshaping of the `categorical` array should be amended to match the dimensions of the input array `y` and the number of classes (`num_classes`).

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    categorical = np.zeros((y.size, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(y.size), y.ravel()] = 1
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```

With this corrected implementation, the function properly reshapes the `categorical` array according to the dimensions of the input array `y` and the number of classes.
