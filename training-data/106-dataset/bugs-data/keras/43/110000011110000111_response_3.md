The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function is not as expected. Specifically, the expected shape is a tuple of length 3, while the actual shape is a tuple of length 4.

The potential error in the `to_categorical` function is the incorrect determination of the output shape. This leads to the shape of the binary matrix not matching the expected shape.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the output shape by appending the `num_classes` to the `input_shape`. In some cases, this can result in an extra dimension being added to the output shape, leading to a shape mismatch.

To fix the bug, the correct output shape should be calculated by concatenating the `input_shape` tuple with `num_classes` and then reversing the order of concatenation, which ensures the correct shape is achieved.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
