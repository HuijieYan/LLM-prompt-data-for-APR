Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1` where the attempt is made to index the `categorical` array using the `y` array.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the `y` array is reshaped before indexing into `categorical`, which leads to misaligned indexing and incorrect assignment of values.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:  To fix the bug, we need to index into the `categorical` array before reshaping it. Additionally, we should handle cases where `num_classes` is not provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    return np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
