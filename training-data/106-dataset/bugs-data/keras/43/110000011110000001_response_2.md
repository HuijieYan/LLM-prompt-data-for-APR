The error message shows that the shape of the one_hot matrix is not as expected. The test function expected the output shape to be (3, 1, 5) but the actual shape was (3, 5).

The potential error location in the `to_categorical` function is the reshaping of the `categorical` matrix at the end of the function. It seems that it is adding an additional dimension to the output shape that is not expected.

The bug is occurring because the reshaping of the `categorical` matrix at the end of the function is adding an additional dimension. This is causing the shape of the output to be different from the expected shape.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the additional dimension added during reshaping and directly return the `categorical` matrix without reshaping it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `to_categorical`:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
