Potential Error Location: The bug is within the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1`. It is attempting to assign the value 1 to elements in the 'categorical' array using the 'y' array as an index.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the shape of the 'categorical' array is different from the shape of the 'y' array. The 'y' array is used to index the 'categorical' array, but they are not compatible in shape.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: The 'y' array needs to be reshaped, so that it is compatible for indexing the 'categorical' array. This involves converting the 'y' array into a column vector when it's a 1D array, converting it into a 2D array when it's a 2D array, etc.

The corrected code for the problematic function is presented below:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    if y.ndim == 1:
        input_shape = (y.shape[0],)
    else:
        input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
