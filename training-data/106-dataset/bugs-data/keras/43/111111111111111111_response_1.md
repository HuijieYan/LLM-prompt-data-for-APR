The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape. The test case creates random labels of varying shapes and checks if the one-hot encoding produced by the `to_categorical` function matches the expected shapes.

The potential error location is the calculation and reshaping of the `categorical` array inside the `to_categorical` function. The `categorical` array is created and reshaped based on the input label and the number of classes. If the reshaping or creation of the `categorical` array is incorrect, it can lead to mismatched shapes in the output.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the `categorical` array is not aligned with the input shape and the number of classes. This leads to incorrect shapes of the output one-hot encoded arrays.

To fix this bug, the reshaping process of the `categorical` array should be modified to ensure that it aligns with the input shape and the number of classes. Additionally, the construction of the `categorical` array should be revised where necessary to ensure that it accurately represents the one-hot encoded values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    # Reshape the categorical array to match input shape and num_classes
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With these modifications, the bug in the `to_categorical` function should be fixed, and the function should produce the correct one-hot encoded arrays with shapes matching the expected output in the test cases.
