The error message provided indicates that there's an assertion error related to the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function. The expected shape is `(3, 5)` but the actual shape is `(3, 1, 5)`.

The potential error location in the code is the line:
```python
output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
```
The issue is that when `input_shape` is a 1D array (e.g., `(3,)`), adding `(num_classes,)` to it will result in a 3D array instead of the expected 2D array. This is why the test case fails.

To fix this issue, the output shape should be calculated based on `input_shape` without adding `(num_classes,)` to it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
```
