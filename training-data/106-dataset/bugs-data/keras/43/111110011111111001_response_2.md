The test case involves creating random labels with different shapes and then using the `to_categorical` function to convert these labels into one-hot encoded vectors. These one-hot encoded vectors are then compared to the expected output shapes and other properties.

The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape for one of the test cases.

The potential error location in the `to_categorical` function is the reshaping of the one-hot encoded matrix. The bug occurs because the reshaping operation does not correctly account for the dimensions of the input label array.

The bug occurs because the reshaping operation does not correctly account for the dimensions of the input label array. The `np.reshape` operation is not suitable for transforming the output into the expected shape.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to use `np.expand_dims` to add a new axis at the end of the array, and then use `np.repeat` to create the one-hot encoding for multiple classes. This will ensure that the dimensions are handled correctly.

The corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes):
    categorical = (np.arange(num_classes) == y[:, None]).astype(int)
    return categorical
```

The corrected function uses broadcasting and boolean indexing to create the one-hot encoded matrix directly, without the need for reshaping. This should solve the bug and produce the correct output shapes for the test cases.
