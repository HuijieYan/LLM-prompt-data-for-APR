Potential error location: 
The line `if not num_classes:` is checking if `num_classes` is None, but it should be checking if `num_classes` is not provided.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when `num_classes` is not provided as an argument.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Modify the if statement to check if `num_classes` is None, and if it is, then calculate the number of classes based on the input vector.

Corrected code:

```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    
    return categorical
