The test case 'test_to_categorical' creates random labels of different shapes and then converts them into one hot encoded vectors using the function 'to_categorical'. It checks whether the shape of the one hot encoded vectors matches the expected shapes.

The error message indicates that for a particular input shape, the shape of the one hot encoded vector is different from the expected shape. This suggests that the function 'to_categorical' is not correctly converting the input labels into one hot encoded vectors as per the expected shapes.

The potential error location within the 'to_categorical' function is the reshaping step. The output_shape variable is calculated with an additional dimension (num_classes,), which is appending an additional dimension to the result.

The bug is occurring because the output_shape calculation includes an additional dimension for num_classes. However, this additional dimension is not required.

To fix the bug, the output_shape calculation should not include the additional dimension for num_classes. Instead, it should simply take the original input shape and append num_classes.

Here's the corrected code for the 'to_categorical' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
