The test case is testing the `to_categorical` function with different shapes of input arrays and comparing the output shapes with the expected shapes. The error message indicates that the shapes of the output arrays are not matching the expected shapes.

The potential error location within the `to_categorical` function is the calculation of the `output_shape` variable. The current implementation is not handling multi-dimensional input shapes correctly, which results in a mismatch in the output shapes.

The bug is occurring because the `output_shape` is being calculated by simply appending the `num_classes` to the `input_shape` tuple. This approach only works correctly for 1D input arrays, but for multi-dimensional input arrays, the concatenation of the `input_shape` and `num_classes` tuple causes the shape mismatch.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `numpy.reshape` function to reshape the output array after setting the appropriate elements to 1 in the array. This will ensure that the output array has the correct shape for both 1D and multi-dimensional input arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function after fixing the bug:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```
