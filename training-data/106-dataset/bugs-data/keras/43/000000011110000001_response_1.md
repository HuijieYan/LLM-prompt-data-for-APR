The code is intended to convert class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

The potential error in the code comes from the reshaping of the 'categorical' array. When reshaping the 'categorical' array, the output_shape is calculated incorrectly, resulting in a shape different from the expected shape.

The bug occurs because the output shape is calculated incorrectly. This leads to mismatched shapes between the expected and actual shapes, causing the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to recalculate the output shape by adding the num_classes to the input_shape using the "+" operator for tuples. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)  # Calculate correct output shape
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output shapes as required by the test function.
