The test case is testing the `to_categorical` function which is supposed to convert a class vector into a binary class matrix. The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function is not as expected, which is causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error in the `to_categorical` function is the reshaping step using `np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)`. This step seems to be incorrect as it is not producing the expected shapes as per the test case.

The bug is occurring because when reshaping the array `categorical` to `output_shape`, the shape is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the `reshape` method should be used instead of `np.reshape`. The correct shape for the `categorical` array can be calculated using `input_shape` and `num_classes` and then reshaping the array accordingly.

The corrected code for the `to_categorical` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
