The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function is not matching the expected shape. This could be due to incorrect reshaping or dimensions manipulation inside the function.

The potential error location within the function is likely related to the reshaping of the `categorical` array to match the `output_shape`. Specifically, in cases where `y` has more than 1 dimension, the reshaping process may not be handled correctly, leading to a mismatch in dimensions and shape.

The bug occurs because the reshaping logic for multi-dimensional input arrays is not implemented correctly. The function does not handle the reshaping process properly for multi-dimensional input arrays.

To fix the bug, the reshaping logic for multi-dimensional input arrays needs to be corrected. The reshaping process should ensure that the new shape matches the expected output shape, taking into account the dimensions of the input array.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    if len(y.shape) > 1:
      categorical = categorical.reshape(y.shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```

With this correction, the reshaping logic properly accounts for the dimensions of the input array, ensuring that the output shape matches the expected shape in all cases.
