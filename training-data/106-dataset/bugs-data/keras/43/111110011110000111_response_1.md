Error analysis:
The test function `test_to_categorical` supplies a `num_classes` parameter that is set to 5, and it creates a list of `labels` using `np.random.randint(0, num_classes, shape)`. It then calls the `to_categorical` function with the `label` and `num_classes` as arguments. The error message indicates that the shape of the `one_hot` array returned by the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape.

Potential error location:
The issue is likely in the `to_categorical` function. Specifically, the problem may be related to reshaping the `categorical` array.

Reason for bug occurrence:
The bug occurs because the reshaping of the `categorical` array to `output_shape` is not being performed correctly.

Approach to fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the reshaping of the `categorical` array should take into account the dimensions of the input shape and the number of classes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```
