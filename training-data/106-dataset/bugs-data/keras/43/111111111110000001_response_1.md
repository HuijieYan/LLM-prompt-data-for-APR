The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape. The function is returning a shape of (3, 1, 5) when it should be (3, 5).

The potential error location in the function is where the reshaping of the categorical matrix is being performed. The wrong shape is being assigned to the output.

The bug occurs because the input shape is being incorrectly specified when reshaping the categorical matrix after filling in the one-hot encoded values.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the correct shape when reshaping the categorical matrix after filling in the one-hot encoded values. The correct shape is the input shape extended by the number of classes (num_classes).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape[:-1])  # Adjusted the shape
    return categorical
```
With this correction, the function should correctly one-hot encode the input and return the desired shape without the bug.
