The test case `test_to_categorical` is comparing the shape of the one_hot outputs with the expected shape and failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates that the shapes are not matching.

The potential error location within the `to_categorical` function is when reshaping the `categorical` array to match the `output_shape`. It seems that the shape of the `categorical` array is not being reshaped correctly to match the expected output shape.

The bug occurs because the reshaping is not taking into account the original shape of the input array `y`. The reshaping should consider the input shape as well as the `num_classes`.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the reshaping accounts for the original shape of the input array `y` and the `num_classes`. This can be achieved by properly calculating the `output_shape` based on the input shape and `num_classes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    if y.ndim > 2:
        raise ValueError("y should have a maximum of 2 dimensions.")
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y.ravel()] = 1
    if y.ndim == 2:
        categorical = categorical.reshape(y.shape[0], y.shape[1], num_classes)
    else:
        categorical = categorical.reshape((n, num_classes))
    return categorical
```

This corrected code handles multi-dimensional input arrays correctly and reshapes the `categorical` array taking into account the original shape of the input array `y` and the `num_classes`.
