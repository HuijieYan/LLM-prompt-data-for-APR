The bug in the `to_categorical` function appears to be due to an issue with reshaping the `categorical` array to have the desired output shape. The purpose of the function is to convert a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

The bug is occurring because the reshaping of the `categorical` array to the `output_shape` is not correctly aligning with the shapes of the input class vectors. This is leading to incorrect reshaping and hence incorrect values in the `categorical` array.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the reshaping of the `categorical` array aligns with the input shape correctly. This would involve determining the correct dimensions for the `categorical` array and ensuring that the reshaping is done correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    for i in range(n):
        categorical[i, y[i]] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With this corrected code, the `categorical` array will be correctly reshaped according to the input shape to produce the expected output.
