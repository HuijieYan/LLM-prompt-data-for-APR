Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1` where it tries to assign a value to specific coordinates in the `categorical` array.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `categorical` array is being reshaped incorrectly, and the assignment to specific coordinates is not working as intended.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `np.eye()` function to create a one-hot encoded matrix for the classes.
2. Reshape the one-hot encoded matrix to the required shape.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.eye(num_classes)[y]
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
