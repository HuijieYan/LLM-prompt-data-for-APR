The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling multi-dimensional arrays properly. It is assuming the input is a 1D array and generating the output accordingly. Additionally, the function is using the global variable `np` which is not provided in the code. 

To fix the buggy function, we need to handle multi-dimensional arrays properly by iterating through the last axis to set the correct indices for the categorical matrix. We also need to import the `numpy` library and use it for array manipulations.

Here's the corrected code for the function `to_categorical`:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        y = y.reshape(-1, y.shape[-1])
        input_shape = y.shape
    
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    
    n = input_shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, y.shape[1], num_classes))
    
    for i in range(y.shape[1]):
        categorical[np.arange(n), i, y[:,i]] = 1
    
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = categorical.reshape(output_shape)
    
    return categorical
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle multi-dimensional input arrays and generate the correct categorical matrix.
