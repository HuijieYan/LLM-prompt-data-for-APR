The provided test_to_categorical() test case creates random labels with different shapes and then uses the buggy to_categorical() function to perform one-hot encoding. The shape of the one-hot encoded output is compared with the expected shapes.

The error message indicates that the shapes of the one-hot encoded outputs are not matching with the expected shapes for some of the test cases. Specifically, the shape (3, 1, 5) is being returned instead of the expected shape (3, 5).

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it can be observed that the implementation does not handle multi-dimensional input arrays correctly. The function currently assumes that the input array is 1-Dimensional, resulting in incorrect reshaping and allocation of the categorical array.

To fix the bug, the to_categorical() function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-dimensional input arrays and calculate the output shape based on the input shape.

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    
    # Create an indexing array to map the 1s to the correct positions in the multi-dimensional array
    index_array = np.eye(num_classes, dtype='int')[y]
    categorical = np.reshape(index_array, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    
    return categorical
```

The corrected function correctly handles multi-dimensional input arrays and calculates the output shape based on the input shape. It should now return the expected one-hot encoded arrays for the provided test cases.
