The error message indicates that the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape in one of the test cases. The expected shape is (3, 5) but the actual shape is (3, 1, 5).

The bug is likely located in the section of the code where the reshaping of the categorical matrix is performed. The input shapes are likely being handled incorrectly, resulting in the mismatch in dimensions.

The issue is likely caused by the incorrect handling of input shapes, particularly when the input matrix `y` is multi-dimensional.

To fix the bug, the reshaping of the categorical matrix should be modified to correctly handle multi-dimensional input shapes. Additionally, the raveling operation may need to be adjusted to properly prepare the input for subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    if y.ndim > 1:
        y = y.ravel()
    n = y.shape[0]
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    else:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, (n, num_classes))
    return categorical
```

This corrected code includes conditional checks to handle multi-dimensional input shapes appropriately and ensures that the reshaping of the categorical matrix is done in a way that matches the expected output shapes.
