Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the condition `if not num_classes:`. This condition will always be true if `num_classes` is not explicitly set to 0, leading to the wrong calculation of `num_classes`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if not num_classes:` does not handle the case where `num_classes` is 0, which is a valid value. As a result, the function always calculates `num_classes` as `np.max(y) + 1`, which can be incorrect.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `num_classes` is None instead of using the condition `if not num_classes`.
2. If `num_classes` is None, calculate it from the maximum value in `y`. Otherwise, use the provided `num_classes` value.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
