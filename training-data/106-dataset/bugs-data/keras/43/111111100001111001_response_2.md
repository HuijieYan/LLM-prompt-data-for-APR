Potential Error Location: The bug seems to occur when reshaping the array `categorical` to `output_shape` using np.reshape. This is causing the wrong output shape for some input arrays.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `np.reshape` function is being used with incorrect parameters, which results in the wrong output shape.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The reshape operation could be causing the bug. Instead of using `np.reshape`, the `categorical` array should be reshaped using its `reshape` method.

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = categorical.reshape(input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
