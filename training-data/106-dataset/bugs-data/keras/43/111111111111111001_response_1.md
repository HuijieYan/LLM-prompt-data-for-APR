The error message indicates that the expected shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function is not matching with the actual shape. Specifically, the assertion `assert one_hot.shape == expected_shape` is failing.

The potential error location in the `to_categorical` function is likely related to the reshaping of the output before returning it. This reshaping step may not be handling the input shapes correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual shapes.

The bug occurred because the reshaping of the categorical array does not consider the original dimensions of the input array `y`. The function assumes one dimension for `y`, but it should take into account that `y` can have multiple dimensions. This mismatch in reshaping causes the output to have unexpected dimensions.

To fix the bug, the reshaping step needs to be modified to handle multi-dimensional input arrays correctly. The function should also consider the existing shape of `y` before reshaping it into a categorical representation.

The corrected code for the `to_categorical` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    if y.ndim > 1:
        y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    else:
        output_shape = (n, num_classes)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

This corrected function checks the number of dimensions in the input array `y` and handles it accordingly when reshaping `categorical`. It preserves the original dimensions of `y` when reshaping it into a categorical representation, ensuring that the output shape matches the expected shape.
