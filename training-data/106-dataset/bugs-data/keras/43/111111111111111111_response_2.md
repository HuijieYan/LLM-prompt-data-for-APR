The test case is trying to verify the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function. The error message indicates that the expected shape is `(3, 5)` but the actual shape is `(3, 1, 5)`.

The potential error location in the `to_categorical` function is where it reshapes the categorical array. It seems to be adding an additional dimension when it should not.

The bug in the code is likely occurring when reshaping the `categorical` array. It's reshaping `categorical` to `output_shape`, which introduces an extra dimension that is not expected.

To fix this bug, the reshaping of the `categorical` array should be done without adding an extra dimension. It should simply reshape to `(num_samples, num_classes)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
```
