The bug occurs because the `to_categorical` function does not handle input shapes correctly when the input `y` has more than one dimension. The buggy function assumes that the input `y` is always one-dimensional, leading to incorrect reshaping and indexing in multi-dimensional arrays.

To fix this bug, the function should handle multi-dimensional input `y` correctly by reshaping it into a one-dimensional array before processing. This means that the function should reshape the input `y` using the `flatten()` method instead of raveling it. 

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.flatten()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
