potential error location is in declaring the shape of the categorical array, `output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)` is incorrect and causing the issue.

The bug is occurring because the function is trying to reshape the categorical array to include the number of classes as the last dimension, but it's not correctly calculating the new shape.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to reshape the categorical array using the `reshape` function directly, instead of manually constructing the output shape.

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = categorical.reshape((input_shape + (num_classes,)))
    return categorical
```
