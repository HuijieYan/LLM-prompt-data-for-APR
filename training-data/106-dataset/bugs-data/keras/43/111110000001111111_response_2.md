The bug lies in the line `y = y.ravel()`, as the `ravel()` method flattens the array. This causes issues when indexing later on.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `y = y.ravel()` line and modify the subsequent code to use the original `y` array without flattening it.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    for i in range(n):
        categorical[i, y[i]] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With this corrected code, the function should work as intended for the provided test cases, and the bug related to flattening the `y` array has been resolved.
