Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the code trying to access the `shape` attribute of the input `y` before converting it into a numpy array.

Reason for the bug: The function is assuming that `y` has a `shape` attribute, but it has not been converted to a numpy array yet.

Approach for fixing the bug: Convert `y` to a numpy array at the beginning of the function to ensure that the `shape` attribute is accessible.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
