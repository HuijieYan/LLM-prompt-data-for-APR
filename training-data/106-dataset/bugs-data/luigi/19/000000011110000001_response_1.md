Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed function where the status of task A is expected to be DISABLED but is instead showing as FAILED.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic in the set_status function. It appears that when a task has excessive failures, it should be disabled and send an error email. However, in the provided function, it is not properly handling the status transitions and conditional checks, which is leading to the incorrect status of the task.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the status transition logic for tasks with excessive failures.
2. Ensure that the status of the task is correctly updated after handling excessive failures.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == FAILED:  # Moved this conditional block before the scheduler_disable_time check
            if task.can_disable():
                task.add_failure()
                if task.has_excessive_failures():
                    task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                    new_status = DISABLED
                    notifications.send_error_email(
                        'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                        '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                        'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                            failures=config.disable_failures,
                            task=task.id,
                            window=config.disable_window,
                            persist=config.disable_persist,
                        ))
    elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():  # Moved this conditional block after the excessive failures check
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    elif new_status == DISABLED:  # Removed the unnecessary 'elif' in this conditional block
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
