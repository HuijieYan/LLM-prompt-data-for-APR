Based on the given information, the bug seems to be in the conditional block `(if new_status == DONE:)` within the `set_status` function. The issue arises when trying to re-enable a task that is already set as disabled. Additionally, the condition `if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:` does not check for the case where the `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None and the task is still disabled.

The bug occurs because the conditions are not properly handling the re-enabling of a task that is already disabled and not accounting for the scenario where `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional block and properly handle the re-enabling of a disabled task and the scenario when `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                task.re_enable()
            else:
                return  # Task should not be re-enabled

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            # notifications.send_error_email(...)  # email notifications as needed
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition `if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:` is replaced with `if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None: task.re_enable()` to properly handle the re-enabling of a task when `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None.
- An else block is added to return if the task should not be re-enabled.
- Email notification is left as a commented out placeholder, but you should implement it according to your specific requirements.
