The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` sets up a scenario where a task is expected to be disabled after encountering a failure and then re-enabled after a certain period of time. However, the test fails at the re-enablement step as the task status is still shown as 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'.

Upon analyzing the provided function, the potential error location within the `set_status` function is the section where a new status is assigned to the task after it encounters a failure. The condition for assigning a new status of 'DISABLED' to the task after excessive failures might not be working as expected, leading to the task status remaining 'FAILED' instead of transitioning to 'DISABLED'.

The reason behind this bug could be related to the condition checking and status assignment logic within the function. When a task encounters an excessive number of failures, it should transition to a 'DISABLED' state, but this transition might not be happening as expected due to the conditional checks in the function.

To fix this bug, the condition for transitioning the task to a 'DISABLED' status after excessive failures needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that the status transition occurs correctly based on the specified criteria.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED  # Assign DISABLED status directly after excessive failures
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Assign current time for scheduler_disable_time

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

The correction involves modifying the status assignment logic to ensure that the transition to 'DISABLED' status occurs appropriately after encountering excessive failures. Additionally, the `scheduler_disable_time` is updated when transitioning to a 'DISABLED' state. With these changes, the test case should now pass as expected.
