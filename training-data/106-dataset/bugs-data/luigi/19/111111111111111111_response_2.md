The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is trying to verify that a task is re-enabled after 100 seconds. However, the assertion fails because the expected status is `'DISABLED'` whereas the actual status is `'FAILED'`.

The issue seems to lie in the `set_status` function of the `SimpleTaskState` class. The function updates the task status based on certain conditions, and it seems that the logic for updating the status to `'DISABLED'` after a certain amount of time is not working correctly.

The bug occurs because the condition for setting the task status to `'DISABLED'` after a failure and excessive failures is not being handled as expected. Therefore, the re-enable logic is not being triggered after the specified time has passed.

To fix the bug, the logic for re-enabling the task after a specified time with excessive failures needs to be reviewed. Additionally, the condition for updating the task status to `'DISABLED'` after some time needs to be evaluated and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... (other methods and attributes) ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
                # re-enable the task after disable_persist seconds
                task.scheduler_disable_time = None
                new_status = DONE
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
            # re-enable the task after disable_persist seconds
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
            new_status = DONE
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for re-enabling the task after the specified time with excessive failures and after the disable_persist time has passed for the task's disabled state has been added or updated. This should address the bug and ensure that the task status is updated correctly.
