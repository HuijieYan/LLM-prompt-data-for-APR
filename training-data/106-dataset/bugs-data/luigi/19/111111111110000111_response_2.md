The test case "test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed" sets up a CentralPlannerScheduler with certain configurations and then adds a task with a status of FAILED. It then asserts that the task status should be DISABLED, and after 101 seconds, the task status should still be DISABLED.

The error message indicates that the task status is not changing as expected. It is initially set to FAILED, but it should be set to DISABLED.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles the task status change based on certain conditions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for changing the status of a task based on its current status and new status is not implemented correctly. The conditions to change the status of a task are not being met as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for changing the status of a task based on its current status and new status needs to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditions for transitioning between different task statuses should be carefully evaluated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from enum import Enum

class TaskStatus(Enum):
    RUNNING = 1
    DISABLED = 2
    DONE = 3
    FAILED = 4

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == TaskStatus.FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == TaskStatus.DISABLED and task.status == TaskStatus.RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == TaskStatus.DISABLED:
            if new_status == TaskStatus.DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == TaskStatus.FAILED and task.can_disable():
            self.add_failure(task)
            if self.has_excessive_failures(task):
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = TaskStatus.DISABLED
                # notifications.send_error_email(...)
        elif new_status == TaskStatus.DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status.value][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the task status is an Enum, and the conditions for transitioning between statuses are handled using the Enum values. Additionally, the add_failure and has_excessive_failures methods are called properly. There are still some placeholders in the code (e.g., notifications.send_error_email) that might need to be addressed based on the actual requirements of the system.
