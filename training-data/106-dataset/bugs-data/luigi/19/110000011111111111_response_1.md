The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` initializes the `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures=1` and `disable_persist=100`. It then sets the time to 0 and adds a task 'A' with status `FAILED` to the scheduler. The task is expected to be disabled now, and after 100 seconds, it should be re-enabled.

The error occurs when the test tries to assert that the status of task 'A' is `FAILED` after 101 seconds, while it should be `DISABLED`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where new_status is being set based on the conditions. The code should properly handle the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` status after a certain period of time.

The bug occurs because the transition to `DISABLED` status after excessive failures and the subsequent re-enable logic is not properly implemented. It seems that the logic for disabling and re-enabling a task after a certain period of time needs to be revised.

To fix the bug, you should update the `set_status` function to handle the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` status after a certain period of time, and make sure that re-enable logic works as expected.

Below is the corrected and updated code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this updated code, the `set_status` function will properly handle the transition to `DISABLED` status and re-enable the task after the specified time, fixing the bug identified in the initial code.
