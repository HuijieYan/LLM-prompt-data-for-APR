The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` sets up a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with certain parameters and then adds a task with the status "FAILED". It then checks if the task status changes to "DISABLED" after a certain amount of time has passed.

The error message indicates that the expected status of the task is "DISABLED" after the specified time has passed, but instead, it is still "FAILED".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_status` method, specifically the part where it handles the transition of status from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" when there are excessive failures.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the transition of task status from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" when there are excessive failures. The condition `if task.has_excessive_failures():` is not properly handled and does not disable the task as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_status` method to correctly disable the task when there are excessive failures. Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            # Disable the task if it has excessive failures
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update the status of the task
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the `set_status` method will properly handle the transition of task status from "FAILED" to "DISABLEED" when there are excessive failures, as well as update the task status accordingly.
