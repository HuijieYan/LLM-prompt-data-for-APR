1. The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking whether a task that has failed will be re-enabled after 100 seconds. The task is initially set to `FAILED`, then the time is advanced by 101 seconds, and finally, the status of the task is checked to see if it has been re-enabled.

2. The potential error is likely within the `set_status` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class, as indicated by the error message which shows an assertion failure when the status is checked.

3. The probable reason behind the bug is that the `set_status` method is not correctly handling the transition of the task status from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` and re-enabling the task after the specified time has passed.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the task reaches a `FAILED` status, it is correctly re-enabled after the specified time has elapsed. Additionally, the transitions between different task statuses need to be properly handled, ensuring that the logic for each status change is accurately implemented.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class:

```python
import time
from notifications import send_error_email  # Import notifications module for sending emails

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected set_status method
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

By incorporating the correct logic for transitioning the task status and re-enabling the task after the specified time, the bug can be fixed in the `set_status` method. Additionally, the `notifications.send_error_email` function is used to send the appropriate email notification when a task is disabled due to excessive failures.
