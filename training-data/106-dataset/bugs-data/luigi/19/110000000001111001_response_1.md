The bug occurs in the given function due to the incorrect comparison of `new_status` with variable names like FAILED and DISABLED. These variable names should be treated as strings within the function.

The identified issue is the incorrect comparison of `new_status` with FAILED and DISABLED without quotation marks which leads to a NameError as these terms are treated as variables.

To fix the bug, we should enclose FAILED and DISABLED within quotes to treat them as strings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
