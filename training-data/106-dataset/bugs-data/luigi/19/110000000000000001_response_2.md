Potential Error:
The potential error is that the code is not handling the case when new_status is FAILED and config is not provided, which should result in an error.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is caused because the code does not check for the existence of the `config` parameter before using it. If `config` is not provided and the new_status is set to FAILED, an error will occur.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `config` is not None before using it. If `config` is required for a specific new_status, we should raise an error if it is not provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time

# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None, "Config is required for setting status to FAILED"

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
