Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the section where the function is checking if the new status is DISABLED and the task status is RUNNING. There is a missing comparison operator after "task.status".

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the missing comparison operator, which is causing the if condition to always evaluate to True.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a comparison operator in the if condition to properly compare the task status with the value RUNNING.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":  # Added comparison operator and enclosed "RUNNING" in quotes
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":  # Enclosed "DISABLED" in quotes
        if new_status == "DONE":  # Enclosed "DONE" in quotes
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":  # Enclosed "DISABLED" in quotes
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
