The issue with the given code is that the 'new_status' variable is checked for equality with some undefined variables like 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' without being properly defined or imported in the function. Also, there was a missing import of the 'time' module that is used in the code.

To fix this issue, we need to import or define 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' correctly in the function. Additionally, we should import the 'time' module if it's used in the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time  # add the import for the time module

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        FAILED = "FAILED"  # define the FAILED status
        DISABLED = "DISABLED"  # define the DISABLED status
        
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":  # compare with string literals
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == "DONE":  # compare with string literal
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
In the corrected function, 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' statuses are properly defined within the function. Additionally, the 'time' module is imported. Now, the function should work as expected.
