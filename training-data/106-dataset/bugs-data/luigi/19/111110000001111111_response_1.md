The buggy function seems to have several issues, and it appears to be a part of a larger codebase related to task scheduling and state management. Let's analyze the issues:

1. The function `set_status` is supposed to handle state transitions for a given task based on the new status provided. However, there are several conditional checks and status updates that might be incorrect.

2. The error case when `new_status` is FAILED and the `config` is not provided might be problematic.

3. The conditional check that evaluates whether the task status should change to DONE when the current status is DISABLED is not properly implemented.

4. The conditional check for failures and sending email notifications seems to be trying to handle scheduling and notification logic within the state management function, which might not be good design.

To fix this function, the logic for transitioning between different task statuses needs to be re-evaluated, and some of the notification and scheduling concerns should be handled outside of this state management function.

Here's the corrected code based on the analysis above:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == 'FAILED':
            if config is None:
                raise ValueError("Config must be provided for setting task status to FAILED")
    
        if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
            return
    
        if task.status == 'DISABLED':
            if new_status == 'DONE':
                self.re_enable(task)
    
        if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    f"Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task.id} due to excessive failures",
                    f"{task.id} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds"
                )
        elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = 0
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, a missing config check is added and the way `scheduler_disable_time` is calculated is also corrected. The email notification sends the configured parameters from the `config` object rather than specific failures and windows. Additionally, an error is raised if `config` is not provided for the FAILED status.
