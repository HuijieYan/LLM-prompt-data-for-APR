The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking whether a task is re-enabled after 100 seconds if it has failed only once. The test sets up a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with one allowed failure and a re-enable time of 100 seconds. It then adds a task with a failed status and checks if it is disabled, and then checks if it is re-enabled after 101 seconds.

The error message indicates that the task with ID 'A' is expected to have a status of `FAILED` but actually has a status of `DISABLED`.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the section where the status is updated without checking the conditions properly. 

The bug occurs because the status is not being updated correctly in the `set_status` function. The function has conditional checks for updating the status based on the value of `new_status`, but these checks are not handling the transitions between different statuses correctly.

To fix the bug, the `set_status` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the status transitions based on the conditions specified. Additionally, the conditions for setting the status need to be checked and updated according to the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config=config)  # pass the config to re_enable

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        if task.status != DISABLED:  # update scheduler_disable_time only if transitioning to DISABLED
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # update the status only if it's not transitioning from/to DISABLED without proper conditions
    if task.status != DISABLED or new_status != FAILED:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the `set_status` function should now correctly handle the status transitions based on the conditions, and the test case should pass without the previous assertion error.
