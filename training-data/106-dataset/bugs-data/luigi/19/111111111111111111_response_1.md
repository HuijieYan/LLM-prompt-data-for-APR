The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` sets up a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures` set to 1 and `disable_persist` set to 100. It then adds a task with ID 'A' and status 'FAILED'. After 101 seconds, it asserts that the status of task 'A' should be 'FAILED', but it actually expects the status to be 'DISABLED'. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles the transition of status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain amount of time.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_status` function does not correctly handle the transition of status from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' when the task has exceeded the allowed failures.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `set_status` function to correctly handle the transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain duration of time has passed without any corrective action.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # Reset the scheduler_disable_time

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the scheduler_disable_time to the current time plus the disable_persist duration
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this corrected logic, the transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' will occur after the specified duration of `config.disable_persist` has passed without corrective action. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
