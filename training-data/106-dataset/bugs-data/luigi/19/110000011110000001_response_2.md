1. The test case "test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed" is checking the behavior of the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class when a task with ID 'A' is added and set to the status of "FAILED". It then verifies that after 101 seconds, the status of task 'A' should change back to "FAILED".

2. The potential error in the given function seems to be in the logic for handling the status change of a task. This logic involves checking the current status of the task and the new status to determine whether the status should be updated and performing necessary actions based on the status change.

3. The given error is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of task status changes and re-enabling tasks after a certain period. It seems like the status change logic is not correctly handling the re-enabling of a task after a specific time period.

4. The status change logic should be reviewed to ensure that the correct conditions are being checked and actions are being performed accordingly. Additionally, the re-enabling mechanism should be thoroughly checked to ensure that tasks are correctly re-enabled after the specified time period.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and new_status != DISABLED:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
