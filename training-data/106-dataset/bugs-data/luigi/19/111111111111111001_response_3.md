The error occurs in the `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` test case. The test initializes a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with `disable_failures` set to 1 and `disable_persist` set to 100. Then it adds a task with the status `FAILED`. After the status change, the test attempts to assert that the task's status is now `DISABLED` after 101 seconds, but instead, it appears that the status is still `FAILED`.

The code provided shows a `set_status` function that handles changing the status of a task. The potential error in the function can be traced to the section where it checks for `FAILED` status and the conditions for disabling the task.

It seems that the condition for disabling the task based on excessive failures is not working as expected. This leads to the task remaining in the `FAILED` state instead of being disabled after 100 seconds.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `set_status` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` status. 

Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        else:
            return  # If the task is disabled, no further changes should be made
            
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Set the disable time if task is disabled

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the function now correctly handles the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` status based on the conditions specified. The test case should pass with this correction.
