The potential error in the `set_status` function is the use of undefined variables such as FAILED and DISABLED.

The bug is caused by the usage of undefined variables as conditions in the `set_status` function. It appears that FAILED and DISABLED are intended to be string values representing the different task statuses.

To fix the bug, we need to define the FAILED and DISABLED variables as strings representing the task statuses, and also ensure that the comparison with task.status is corrected to task.status within the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistence.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        FAILED = "failed"
        DISABLED = "disabled"
        
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
        
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "running":
            return
        
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == "done":
                self.re_enable(task)
            
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
        
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
