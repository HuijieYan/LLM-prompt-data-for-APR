The test case "test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed" is checking whether a task is automatically re-enabled after being disabled due to a failure. The expected behavior is that the task should be disabled after one failure and then re-enabled after 100 seconds.

The error message indicates that after 101 seconds, the task's status is still "FAILED" instead of being "DISABLED" as expected.

Upon reviewing the code, the issue seems to be with the logic in the "set_status" function. When the task has excessive failures and is supposed to be disabled, the status is not correctly updated to "DISABLED".

The reason for this bug is that the logic to handle task status transitions, specifically when transitioning from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" due to excessive failures, is not properly implemented.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the "set_status" function to correctly handle the transition from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" when there are excessive failures. Additionally, we need to ensure that the task's status is updated based on the specified conditions and rules.

Here's the corrected code for the "set_status" function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the scheduler_disable_time
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status != task.status:  # Only update status if it's different
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to update the "scheduler_disable_time" when transitioning from "FAILED" to "DISABLED" after detecting excessive failures. Additionally, we ensure that the task's status is only updated if the new status is different from the current status.
