The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' should be DISABLED after the failure, but it's currently showing as FAILED.

The potential error location in the code is within the `set_status` function. It seems that the condition for setting the status to DISABLED after a failure is not functioning correctly.

The reason behind this bug is that the code is not properly handling the transition of the task status from FAILED to DISABLED in the `set_status` function. Additionally, the condition for re-enabling the task after a certain period is also not implemented correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_status` function to handle the transition from FAILED to DISABLED correctly and implement the re-enabling of tasks after a certain period.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Pass the config to re_enable function
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the `re_enable` function is called with the `config` parameter to correctly re-enable the task after a certain period. Additionally, the conditions for transitioning the task status are modified to handle the status change from FAILED to DISABLED correctly.
