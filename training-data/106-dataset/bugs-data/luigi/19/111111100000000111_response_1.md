The potential error location within the problematic function is the `add_failure` method being called as `task.add_failure()` but the method is defined as `add_failure(self)`.

The bug occurs because the `add_failure` method is being called on the `task` object, but the method is actually defined as a method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. Therefore, calling `task.add_failure()` does not actually call the correct method.

To fix this bug, the `add_failure` method should be called on the `self` object instead of the `task` object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
        
    if new_status == FAILED and self.can_disable(task):  # fix here
        self.add_failure(task)  # fix here
        if self.has_excessive_failures(task):  # fix here
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
