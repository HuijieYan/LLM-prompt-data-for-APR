The bug occurs when the `set_status` function encounters the `FAILED` status. In this case, it is supposed to determine whether the task has excessive failures and, if so, disable the task and send an error email. However, the `task.add_failure()` function call is invalid and needs to be replaced with `self.add_failure(task)`. Additionally, the method `has_excessive_failures` is a part of the task object but is being called as a method of the `task` object. It should be called on the `self` object instead.

To fix this bug, the `set_status` function needs to be updated as follows:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
        
    if new_status == FAILED and self.can_disable(task):
        self.add_failure(task)
        if self.has_excessive_failures(task, config.disable_failures, config.disable_window):
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
