The bug seems to occur when `new_status` is set to 'FAILED' and the `task` can be disabled. In this case, if the task has excessive failures, the function is incorrectly setting `new_status` to 'DISABLED' and then sending an error email.

This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior and the existing status management in the `set_status` function. The task should only be set to 'DISABLED' if the failures have reached the limit, and the disabling should not be directly followed by setting the status to 'FAILED'. Instead, it should only be changed to 'DISABLED' when the task has reached the failure limit.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling task status transitions needs to be revised. When a task is being considered for failure and possible disabling, these steps should be followed:
1. If the failure count exceeds the limit, set the task status as 'DISABLED'.
2. If the task is being disabled, set the `scheduler_disable_time` and then proceed with other related actions.
3. Otherwise, if the task is not being disabled, simply increment the failure count and proceed with other related actions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == DISABLED:
        task.status = DISABLED
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
    elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    else:
        task.add_failure()
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
