The issue with the provided code is that there are multiple checks for `new_status` and `task.status`, and some of these conditions are conflicting. Additionally, the assert statement for `FAILED` condition is incomplete.

Here are the issues and the reasons for the bug:
1. The assert statement for `FAILED` condition is incomplete.
2. There are conflicting conditions for `new_status` and `task.status` leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the issues, you can use the following corrected code:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None, "Config must not be None for FAILED status"

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and new_status != 'DISABLED':
            return  # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            # Modify the following line to use the format method correctly
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In this corrected code:
- The assert statement for `FAILED` condition is complete.
- Conflicting conditions for `new_status` and `task.status` have been modified to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The email notification has been modified to use the `format` method correctly.

This corrected code should address the issues and provide the expected behavior based on the provided test cases.
