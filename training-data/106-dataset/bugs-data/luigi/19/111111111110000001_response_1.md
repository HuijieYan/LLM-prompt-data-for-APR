The error occurs due to the incorrect status being set for task 'A' in the test function. The assert statement expects the status to be 'DISABLED' but it is 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the set_status function is the logic related to handling the status changes.

The bug occurs because the logic for setting the status of the task based on new_status and the current status is incorrect. Also, there seems to be confusion in the conditional checks for FAILED and DISABLED status.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the status of the task needs to be re-evaluated. Specifically, the conditions for setting the task to DISABLED and FAILED statuses need to be reviewed. Additionally, the logic within the if statements for each status (FAILED, DISABLED) needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the set_status function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update the status and the task list
    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for setting the task status is properly revised. The status is updated based on the conditions for each status along with properly maintaining the task list.
