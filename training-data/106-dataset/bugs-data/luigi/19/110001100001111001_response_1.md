The function `set_status` is incorrectly setting the status to DISABLED when the new status is FAILED and the task has excessive failures. It also sets the `task.scheduler_disable_time` to the current time if the new status is DISABLED. Furthermore, it modifies the `self._status_tasks` based on the new status.

The issue with the function is that it does not handle the case where the `new_status` is different from FAILED or DISABLED. Additionally, it is mixing logic for disabling tasks based on failures and for setting task status as disabled based on runtime conditions.

To fix this, we can add a conditional check for new_status and handle setting the status as per the value of `new_status` outside of the conditional blocks for FAILED and DISABLED.

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Set the task status outside of the conditional blocks
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the fixed code, we have separated out the setting of task status based on different conditions, added a conditional check to handle new_status other than 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED', and moved the logic to set the task status outside the conditional blocks. This should fix the issues with the original function.
