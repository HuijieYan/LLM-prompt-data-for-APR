The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking if a task that has failed once is automatically re-enabled after 100 seconds. It sets up the scheduler with `disable_failures=1` and then adds a task with status `FAILED`. Then, it checks if the task's status has changed to `DISABLED` after the failure and after 101 seconds, it checks if the status has changed back to `FAILED`.

The error message indicates that the status does not change back to `FAILED` after 101 seconds, which is the expected behavior according to the test case.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the logic related to handling the status transition from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` after a task has failed once and was automatically disabled.

The bug occurs because the logic for re-enabling a task after 101 seconds is not implemented correctly. When the task's status changes to `DISABLED` due to a failed task, the logic to re-enable the task after a certain amount of time is missing.

To fix the bug, a new logic needs to be added to the `set_status` function to handle the re-enabling of tasks after a certain amount of time. This logic should check if the task's status is `DISABLED` and if the time elapsed is greater than the disable persist time. If so, the task's status should be changed back to `FAILED`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # re-enable the task if it was previously disabled and the disable time has elapsed
        elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
                new_status = DISABLED
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time > config.disable_persist:
            new_status = FAILED  # change the status back to FAILED if the disable time has elapsed
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the re-enabling of tasks after the disable persist time has elapsed when the task's status is `DISABLED`.
