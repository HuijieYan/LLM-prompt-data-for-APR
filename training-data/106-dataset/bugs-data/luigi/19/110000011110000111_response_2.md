The error message indicates that the test case is expecting the task status to transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' after a certain period of time, but the transition is not happening as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section that handles the transition from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' status.

The bug occurs because in the original code, when the task has excessive failures and is being disabled, the status is changed to 'DISABLED' but the task's status is not being updated accordingly. This results in the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the task is disabled due to excessive failures, its status is properly updated to 'DISABLED' and when it is re-enabled after a certain period of time, the status should be updated back to 'FAILED'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the task's status will now be properly updated when it transitions between 'FAILED' and 'DISABLED' based on the specified conditions.
