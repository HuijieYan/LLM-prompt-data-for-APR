The bug in the provided code is that when the task's status is set to DISABLED, it does not reset the `scheduler_disable_time` to `None`. This results in the subsequent assertion error in the test case.

The potential error location is identified as the part where the new status is set to DISABLED in the `set_status` function.

The reason behind the bug is that when a task is re-enabled after being disabled due to excessive failures, the `scheduler_disable_time` is not reset, causing it to remain in the DISABLED status.

To fix this bug, the `scheduler_disable_time` should be set to `None` when the status is changed to something other than DISABLED.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
    else:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, when the task's status is changed to something other than DISABLED, the `scheduler_disable_time` is set to `None`. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass without assertion errors.
