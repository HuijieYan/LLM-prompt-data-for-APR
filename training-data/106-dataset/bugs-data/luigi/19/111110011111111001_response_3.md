The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` checks whether a task is re-enabled after a certain period when it fails for the first time. The initial status of the task is set to FAILED, and then it is expected to change to DISABLED after 100 seconds.

The error message indicates that the status of the task did not change from FAILED to DISABLED after the expected time. This suggests that the `set_status` method is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the `set_status` method is likely in the section that handles the transition from FAILED to DISABLED status. It seems that the conditions or logic for transitioning the task status are not being applied correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect conditional checks or missing logic for transitioning the status from FAILED to DISABLED.

To fix the bug, the logic for transitioning the status from FAILED to DISABLED needs to be revised. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the time-based re-enable functionality is correctly implemented.

Below is the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
from time import time
# ... omitted code ...

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the scheduler_disable_time is set to the current time plus the disable_persist value when transitioning from FAILED to DISABLED. This ensures that the task will be re-enabled after the specified period.

This revised logic should address the issue described in the error message and ensure that the transition from FAILED to DISABLED status occurs as expected.
