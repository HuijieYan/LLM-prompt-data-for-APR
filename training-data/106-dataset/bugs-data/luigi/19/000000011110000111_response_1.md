The issue seems to be with the comparison of the expected and actual status of the task in the `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` test case. The test expects `FAILED` but gets `DISABLED`. This suggests that the task status is not transitioning from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` as expected in the buggy function.

Potential error location: The condition for handling the `DISABLED` status and transitioning to `FAILED` is likely causing the issue.

Reasons for the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the transition from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` status for the task.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The condition for transitioning from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` status should be correctly implemented.
2. Ensure that the logic for setting the new status and updating task details accurately reflects the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    _status_tasks = {}  # assuming this is defined elsewhere

    # corrected set_status method
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None  # assuming FAILED and config are defined elsewhere

        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return

        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                # notifications.send_error_email(...)  # assuming notifications is defined elsewhere
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        if task.id in self._status_tasks[task.status]:  # updating the current status tasks
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)

        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task  # updating the new status tasks
        task.status = new_status
```

This corrected code ensures that the transition from `DISABLED` to `FAILED` is handled appropriately. However, it assumes that some variables such as `FAILED`, `DISABLED`, `RUNNING`, and `DONE` as well as other external functions and data structures such as `self.re_enable`, `task.can_disable`, and `notifications` are defined elsewhere.
