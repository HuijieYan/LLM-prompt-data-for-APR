The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` is checking whether a task is re-enabled after being in a FAILED state for 100 seconds. The error message indicates that the task is still in the DISABLED state instead of the expected FAILED state.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles setting the status of a task.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for setting the status of the task is incorrect. It is not properly handling the re-enabling of a task after being in a FAILED state.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the status of the task needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the re-enabling of a task after being in a FAILED state.


```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
        
    if new_status != DISABLED:  # Add this condition to handle re-enabling of the task
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # Reset the disable time when the status is not DISABLED

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
