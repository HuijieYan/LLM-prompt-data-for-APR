There are several issues with the provided function.

1. The first if condition checks if `new_status` is equal to `FAILED`, but `FAILED` is not defined anywhere in the function. It should be replaced with `"FAILED"` (as a string).
2. The function is missing an import for the `time` module, which is used to set the `scheduler_disable_time`. This needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.
3. The `notifications` module is being used but it's not imported nor defined anywhere. This needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.
4. In the second `if` condition, `task.status` should be compared to `new_status` instead of `DISABLED`.
5. In the correction of the code, there's a dictionary `self._status_tasks` being used but it's not defined in the provided code. It's assumed that it's defined elsewhere in the code.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import time  # import the time module
import notifications  # import the notifications module

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == "FAILED":  # replace FAILED with "FAILED"
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == "DISABLED" and task.status == new_status:  # compare task status with new_status
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:  # allow scheduler to override disable time
            return

    if new_status == "FAILED" and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # set the scheduler_disable_time

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)  # assuming _status_tasks is defined elsewhere
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
