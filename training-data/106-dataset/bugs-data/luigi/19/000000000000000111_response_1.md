The potential error in the code is the use of undefined variables such as FAILED, DISABLED, and RUNNING. These variables are not declared or initialized in the given code, leading to a NameError when the function is called.

To fix this, we need to declare and initialize these variables with the appropriate values. Additionally, there are syntax errors that need to be addressed, such as the missing import statement for the `time` module and the undefined `notifications` variable.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time
import notifications

# corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "failed"
    DISABLED = "disabled"
    RUNNING = "running"

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "done":
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task.id} due to excessive failures',
                f'{task.id} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
            )
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
1. The variables such as FAILED, DISABLED, and RUNNING are declared and initialized to their respective string values.
2. The time module is imported to use the `time.time()` function.
3. The `notifications` variable is assumed to be properly defined outside the scope of this function.
