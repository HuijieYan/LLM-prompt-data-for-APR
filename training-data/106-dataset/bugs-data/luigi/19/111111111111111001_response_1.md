The test case `test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed` adds a task 'A' with the status 'FAILED' to the CentralPlannerScheduler. It then checks if the task status changes to 'DISABLED' after 100 seconds. However, the test fails because the status remains 'FAILED' instead of changing to 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the block of code that handles the status change when a task has excessive failures.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for changing the task status to 'DISABLED' after excessive failures is not functioning properly. The function does not update the task status to 'DISABLED' and does not set the `scheduler_disable_time` correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the logic for updating the task status and setting the `scheduler_disable_time` is correctly implemented. Additionally, it's important to verify that the conditions for changing the task status are met.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status != DONE and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
        elif new_status == DONE:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist

    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
