Potential error location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the 'test_automatic_re_enable_with_one_failure_allowed' test case. The test case sets the status of task 'A' to FAILED, and then expects it to be set to DISABLED after 100 seconds.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug seems to be in the 'set_status' method. The method is not handling the transition from FAILED to DISABLED as expected in the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The 'set_status' method should be modified to correctly handle the transition from FAILED to DISABLED, taking into account the time conditions for re-enabling tasks after failures.

Corrected code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    import time

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time < config.disable_persist:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        if task.status != DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
