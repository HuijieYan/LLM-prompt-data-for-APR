Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the buggy function's logic for setting the status of a task. Specifically, when a task's new status is set to `DISABLED` after a certain amount of time, it should transition from the status of `FAILED` to `DISABLED`. However, in the buggy implementation, the new status is not being set correctly after the elapsed time.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The buggy code is not handling the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` correctly. The `re_enable` function seems to be called based on time elapsed, but the status is not being updated properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly transition the status from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` after the specified time has passed.
2. Check if the `re_enable` function is being called at the correct time and ensure that the status transition is properly handled within that function.

Correction to the Buggy Function:
The corrected version of the `set_status` function is as follows:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED  # Update status to DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Set the scheduler disable time to the current time

    # Update the task status and its references in the _status_tasks
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With the above changes, the status transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` will be handled correctly, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
