The error occurs in the `set_status` function. When the new status is `FAILED` and the task is disabled, it should add a failure, check if there are excessive failures, and then update the status to `DISABLED` if needed. 

The bug occurs because the code doesn't properly handle the transition from one status to another, particularly when transitioning from `FAILED` to `DISABLED`. It sets the status to `DISABLED`, but it does not update the `scheduler_disable_time`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `scheduler_disable_time` when the status is changed to `DISABLED`. We should also check if the task's status needs to be updated when it is disabled, instead of immediately setting the status to `DISABLED` when the new status is `FAILED` if the task can be disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # update scheduler_disable_time when re-enabled

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # update scheduler_disable_time when status is set to DISABLED

    if task.status != new_status:  # check if status needs to be updated
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
In this corrected code, we updated the `scheduler_disable_time` correctly when the task is re-enabled, and we made sure to update the `scheduler_disable_time` when the status is set to `DISABLED`. We also added a check to see if the status needs to be updated before making any changes to the status.
