The potential error in the `set_status` function is that the variable `FAILED` is used without being defined.

This bug occurs because the code is checking the `new_status` against `FAILED` without defining what `FAILED` is. It seems like `FAILED` should be a variable or constant defined somewhere in the code, but it is missing.

To fix this bug, we should define `FAILED` as a constant at the beginning of the file and then use it in the `set_status` function as needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_19/luigi/scheduler.py

# Define constants
FAILED = "FAILED"
DISABLED = "DISABLED"
DONE = "DONE"
RUNNING = "RUNNING"

# relative function's signature in this file
def add_failure(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def has_excessive_failures(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def can_disable(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected set_status function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
