The bug occurs in the `set_status` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. The code contains multiple issues:

1. `FAILED` and `DISABLED` are used, but they are not defined. These should be string literals.

2. In the line where `task.add_failure()` is called, `task` is a dictionary, so there are no methods associated with it.

3. It is unclear how `notifications` is being imported and the `send_error_email` method is being used.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:

1. Define `FAILED` and `DISABLED` as string literals.

2. Check the structure of the `task` dictionary and identify the correct method to use for adding a failure.

3. Check the import of `notifications` and ensure that the `send_error_email` method is being used correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = 'FAILED'
    DISABLED = 'DISABLED'

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task['status'] == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task['status'] == DISABLED:
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif 'scheduler_disable_time' in task and task['scheduler_disable_time'] is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task['disable_failures'] is not None and task['disable_window'] is not None and task['disable_persist'] is not None:
        task['failures'] += 1
        if task['failures'] > task['disable_failures']:
            task['scheduler_disable_time'] = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            if 'notifications' in globals() and 'send_error_email' in notifications.__dict__:
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task['id']),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=task['disable_failures'],
                        task=task['id'],
                        window=task['disable_window'],
                        persist=task['disable_persist'],
                    )
                )
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task['scheduler_disable_time'] = None

    self._status_tasks[task['status']].pop(task['id'])
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task['id']] = task
    task['status'] = new_status
```
