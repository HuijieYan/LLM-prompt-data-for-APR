The function `set_status` has multiple issues:

1. It uses variables like FAILED, DISABLED, and time without importing necessary packages and defining these variables.
2. There are references to objects like `time`, `notifications` that are not defined or imported in the function.
3. It contains logic for scheduling tasks and disabling them based on certain criteria, which involves the handling of `task.scheduler_disable_time` and `task.can_disable()`.

Given the nature of these issues, it seems that the function is a part of a larger system for scheduling and managing tasks, potentially related to a task management system.

To fix the function, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Import any necessary packages/modules that are required for the function to work correctly.
2. Define any missing variables like FAILED, DISABLED, time, and notifications.
3. Ensure that the function conforms to the expected behavior based on the input variables and expected outputs provided.

Here's the corrected code based on the analysis:

```python
import time  # add necessary import statements
import notifications  # add necessary import statements

# corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "FAILED"  # define missing variables
    DISABLED = "DISABLED"

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable():
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task}',
                f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
            )
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In this corrected code:
- The necessary imports are added at the beginning of the file.
- Variables like `FAILED` and `DISABLED` are defined.
- The string formatting uses f-strings for better readability and maintainability.
