Potential error location: The potential error location in the provided code is the `move` function. The `exists` method is used to check if the new path exists, but it is not defined within the `LocalFileSystem` class.

Reasons behind the bug: The `exists` method is called without being defined in the `LocalFileSystem` class. Therefore, it will raise an AttributeError since the method is not found.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The `exists` method needs to be defined within the `LocalFileSystem` class to properly check if the new path exists. Additionally, the `os` module needs to be imported to utilize the `os.path.exists` method.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def exists(self, path):
        return os.path.exists(path)

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected move function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and self.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
