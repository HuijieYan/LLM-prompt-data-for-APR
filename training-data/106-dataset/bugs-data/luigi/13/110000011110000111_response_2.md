The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called in the move function. This means that the 'move' function is trying to access an attribute 'fs' that does not exist.

The potential error location within the problematic function is on the line 'self.fs.mkdir(d)', where 'fs' is being called as an attribute of 'self', which is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'move' function is trying to access an attribute 'fs' that does not exist in the 'LocalFileSystem' object.

To fix this bug, the call to 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' should be replaced with 'os.mkdir(d)'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
