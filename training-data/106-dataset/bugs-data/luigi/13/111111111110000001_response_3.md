Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `move` function within the `LocalFileSystem` class. Specifically, the error message indicates that the attribute `fs` is not found within the `LocalFileSystem` class.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the use of `self.fs` instead of just `self` within the `move` function. The `move` function is a method of the `LocalFileSystem` class, so it should be using `self` to reference the instance of the class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, simply replace `self.fs` with `self` within the `move` function.

```python
# Corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By using `self.mkdir(d)` instead of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, we ensure that the `move` function is accessing the `mkdir` method within the same class. Additionally, the `os.rename` function remains unchanged.
