The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is referenced in the `move` method.

Upon reviewing the `move` method, it appears that there is a misuse of `self.fs`. It seems like the intention was to access the file system operations directly from the `LocalFileSystem` object, rather than through `self.fs`. 

To fix this bug, we need to replace `self.fs` with `self` in the `move` method.

Here's the corrected `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Access the mkdir method directly from the LocalFileSystem object
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
