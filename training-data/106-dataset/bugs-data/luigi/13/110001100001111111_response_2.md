The bug in the `move` function is that it is not importing the necessary `os` module. This is causing the `os.path.exists` and `os.path.dirname` functions to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the file where the `move` function is defined.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_13/luigi/file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def exists(self, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

This change will fix the bug by allowing the `os` module to be used within the `move` function.
