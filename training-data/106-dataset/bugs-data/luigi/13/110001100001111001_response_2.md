The bug occurs when the `move` function is called with the `raise_if_exists` parameter set to `False`. In this case, the function does not check if the new path already exists before performing the move operation. This can potentially lead to data loss if the new_path already exists, as the function will overwrite it without any warning.

To fix this bug, the `move` function should always check if the new_path already exists and only perform the move operation if it doesn't.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    if os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise FileExistsError("File already exists at destination: %s" % new_path)
    
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `os.path.exists(new_path)` after the check for `raise_if_exists`. If the new_path already exists, a `FileExistsError` will be raised, preventing the move operation from overwriting the existing file.
