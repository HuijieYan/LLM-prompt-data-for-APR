Based on the error message, the AttributeError is being raised at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` in the move function. This indicates that the LocalFileSystem instance does not have an attribute called `fs`.

The reason for this error is that the move function is trying to access the `fs` attribute of the LocalFileSystem instance, but it does not exist.

To fix this bug, we can replace `self.fs` with `self` since the move function is already within the scope of LocalFileSystem instance.

Here's the corrected code for the move function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
