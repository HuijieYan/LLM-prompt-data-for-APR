The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called within the move method. This suggests that the 'self' parameter inside the move method is being mistakenly used as 'self.fs', and this attribute is not defined for the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

It seems that there is a misunderstanding of how the 'self' parameter is being used within the move method. The 'self' parameter in the context of a class method already refers to the instance of the class, so there is no need to access 'self.fs'. Instead, we should directly call the methods within the class using 'self'.

To fix the issue, the corrected move method should be as follows:

```python
import os
# ... other import statements ...

class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    # ... other method definitions ...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)  # Modify this line to call the mkdir method using 'self'
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By making this change, the move method will correctly call the mkdir method using 'self' without needing to access 'self.fs'.
