Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is the use of 'os.path.exists(new_path)' to check if the new path exists, and then raising an error if it does. This check is not sufficient as the new_path might be a directory and not a file, leading to a false-positive result.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the provided function does not properly handle the case when the new_path is a directory instead of a file. As a result, the function may incorrectly raise an error when it is not necessary.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can use 'os.path.isfile(new_path)' to check if the new_path exists and is a file. If it is a directory, we can handle it appropriately without raising an error.

Corrected Code:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists:
        if os.path.exists(new_path):
            if os.path.isfile(new_path):
                raise RuntimeError('Destination file exists: %s' % new_path)
            else:
                raise RuntimeError('Destination directory exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
