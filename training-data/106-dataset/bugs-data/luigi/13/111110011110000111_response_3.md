The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs'. This suggests that within the 'move' method of 'LocalFileSystem', the function is trying to access an attribute 'fs' which does not exist. 

The potential error location within the 'move' method is the line 'self.fs.mkdir(d)'. The 'fs' attribute is not defined within the 'LocalFileSystem' class, which results in the AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'move' method is trying to access an attribute 'fs' that does not exist within the 'LocalFileSystem' class. 

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to replace 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' with 'self.mkdir(d)'. This will access the 'mkdir' method within the 'LocalFileSystem' class directly, without the need for the 'fs' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the 'move' method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
