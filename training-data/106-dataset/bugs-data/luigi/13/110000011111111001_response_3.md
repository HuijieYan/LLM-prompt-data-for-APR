The error in the provided function is due to the usage of `self.fs` to reference the file system object within the method. The `self` parameter is already referring to the file system object, so there's no need to access it using `self.fs`.

The potential error location is in the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`.

The reason for the bug is that the method is incorrectly trying to access the file system object using `self.fs`, which is not the correct way of accessing it.

To fix the bug, the method should directly call the `mkdir` method on the `self` object, which already represents the file system object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

# corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By directly calling `self.mkdir(d)`, we are accessing the `mkdir` method of the file system object represented by `self`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
