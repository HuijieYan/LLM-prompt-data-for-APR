The potential error in the `move` function is that the `self.fs.mkdir(d)` line is trying to access the `mkdir` method of `self.fs`, but `self.fs` is not defined or available within the `LocalFileSystem` class. 

To fix this bug, we can simply replace `self.fs.mkdir(d)` with `self.mkdir(d)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
