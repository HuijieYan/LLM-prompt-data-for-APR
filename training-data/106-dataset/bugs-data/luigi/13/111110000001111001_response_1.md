The bug in the `move` function is that it doesn't handle the creation of intermediate directories when moving a file to a new location. 

The error occurs when the function tries to move a file to a new directory that does not exist. The code does check if the new directory exists, but it doesn't create the new directory if it does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to create the new directory if it does not exist before trying to move the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Create the new directory if it does not exist
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
