The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the `move` function of the `LocalFileSystem` class. It states that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'.

Upon analyzing the code, the issue seems to be with the use of `self.fs` in the `move` function. There is no attribute `fs` defined within the `LocalFileSystem` class, which is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `move` function is trying to access an attribute `fs` which does not exist in the `LocalFileSystem` class.

To fix this bug, the `move` function needs to use the `self` keyword instead of `self.fs`.

Here is the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By using `self.mkdir(d)` instead of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, the function now correctly calls the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class.
