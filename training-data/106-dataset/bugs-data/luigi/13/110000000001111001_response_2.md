Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the line `d = os.path.dirname(new_path)`. Here, the code is attempting to get the directory name of `new_path` without checking if `new_path` exists. This can cause an error if `new_path` does not exist.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `new_path` exists before attempting to get the directory name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `new_path` exists before getting the directory name to avoid potential errors.
2. Handle the case where `new_path` does not exist by creating the directory if necessary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    
    if not os.path.exists(new_path):
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
    
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
