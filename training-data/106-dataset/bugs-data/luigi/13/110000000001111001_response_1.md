Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, where `self.fs` is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Reason for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurred because the code is trying to use `self.fs` without defining it. It seems that `self.fs` is intended to be a file system object, but it has not been defined or initialized in the provided code.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `self.fs` is properly defined and initialized before using it in the `move` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self, fs):
        self.fs = fs

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
