The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs', which is being called in the 'move' function.

The potential error location within the 'move' function is where 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' is being called. It seems like 'self.fs' is being used to access the 'mkdir' function, but 'fs' has not been defined within the class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there is no attribute 'fs' within the 'LocalFileSystem' class. It seems like the intention was to use the 'mkdir' function from the same class, but it is being accessed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to change 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' to 'self.mkdir(d)'. This will call the 'mkdir' function that is present within the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

Below is the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
