The error message is indicating that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called in the 'move' method of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` because it is trying to access the 'fs' attribute of the 'LocalFileSystem' object, which does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'move' method is trying to access an attribute 'fs' that does not exist in the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

To fix the bug, the 'move' method should directly call the 'mkdir' method of the 'LocalFileSystem' object without accessing the 'fs' attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
