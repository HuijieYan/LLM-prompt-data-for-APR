The potential error in the `move` function is that it does not handle the case where the new path already exists when the `raise_if_exists` parameter is set to `True`. This should raise an error if the new path already exists, but it is currently not functioning as intended due to the use of `os.path.exists` to check for the existence of the new path.

To fix this bug, we can use `os.path.lexists` instead of `os.path.exists`. The `os.path.lexists` function checks for the existence of the path without following symbolic links, which is more appropriate for checking if a file or directory exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.lexists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this change, the `move` function should now correctly raise an error if the new path already exists and the `raise_if_exists` parameter is set to `True`.
