The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which suggests that there is a problem within the move function in the code.

The potential error location within the move function is the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, where the 'fs' attribute is being accessed on the 'self' object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that 'self' in this context is already an instance of LocalFileSystem, so there's no need to access 'fs' attribute.

To fix the bug, simply replace `self.fs.mkdir(d)` with `self.mkdir(d)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
