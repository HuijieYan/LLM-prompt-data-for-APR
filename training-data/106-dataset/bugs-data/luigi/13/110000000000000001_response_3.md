Potential Error Location:
The potential error is occurring in the condition `if d and not os.path.exists(d)`. This condition is trying to check if the directory exists, but it is not handling the case when the directory already exists.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when the directory already exists. It only checks if the directory does not exist before attempting to create it, which leads to an error when the directory already exists.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to handle the case when the directory already exists by using a try-except block to catch the exception and ignore it. Another approach is to use `os.makedirs(d, exist_ok=True)` to create the directory if it does not exist and not raise an error if it already exists.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    try:
        os.makedirs(d, exist_ok=True)
    except FileExistsError:
        pass
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
