The error occurs in the `move` method within the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'. This suggests that `self.fs` is not a valid attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object. 

The potential error location is the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` within the `move` method. It seems that `self.fs` is being used instead of `self`, which is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is likely a simple typo or misunderstanding of the correct attribute to use within the `move` method.

To fix the bug, the `move` method should be modified to use `self` instead of `self.fs` when calling the `mkdir` method. This will ensure that we are calling the `mkdir` method on the correct object and will resolve the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the `move` method should work as expected.
