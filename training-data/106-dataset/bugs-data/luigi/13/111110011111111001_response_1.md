The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. The error message indicates that 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs', which suggests that `self.fs` is not a valid attribute of the LocalFileSystem class.

The bug occurred because the 'fs' attribute is being accessed within the 'move' function, but it is not defined within the LocalFileSystem class. The 'move' function is trying to access 'fs' as an attribute of 'self', but it has not been defined or initialized anywhere within the LocalFileSystem class.

To fix this bug, the 'move' function should use the 'mkdir' function of the LocalFileSystem class instead of trying to access 'fs' as an attribute. The 'mkdir' function is already available as part of the LocalFileSystem class, so there is no need to access 'fs' to call it.

Here is the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, `self.fs.mkdir(d)` has been replaced with `self.mkdir(d)`. This change ensures that the 'move' function uses the 'mkdir' function within the LocalFileSystem class to create the directory, rather than trying to access a non-existent 'fs' attribute.
