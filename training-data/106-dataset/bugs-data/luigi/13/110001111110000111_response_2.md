Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The AttributeError is raised because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `move` method is trying to access the `fs` attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object, which does not exist. This is causing the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `move` method to directly call the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` object without referencing `fs`.
2. Modify the `LocalFileSystem` class to include an attribute `fs` and then access it within the `move` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Update this line to directly call the mkdir method of the LocalFileSystem object
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
