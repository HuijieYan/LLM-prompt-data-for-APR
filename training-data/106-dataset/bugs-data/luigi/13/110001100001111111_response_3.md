Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring when trying to check if the new destination path exists and raising an error if it does. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to raise an error if the destination exists is not being checked correctly. The condition is checking if new_path exists, but it should be checking if the destination file exists.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to check if the destination file exists, rather than just the directory.
2. Check if the old and new paths are the same and handle this case accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    
    if os.path.exists(old_path) and old_path != new_path:  # Added check for old_path existence and if old_path is the same as new_path
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError('Source file does not exist or source and destination paths are the same.')
```
