The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being incorrectly accessed in the buggy 'move' function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line 'self.fs.mkdir(d)'. The 'fs' attribute is not defined in the 'LocalFileSystem' class, so attempting to access it will result in an 'AttributeError'.

The bug occurred because the code incorrectly attempted to access 'fs' as an attribute of 'self', which is not defined in the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

To fix the bug, the 'move' function should use 'self.mkdir(d)' rather than 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' to create the directory if it doesn't exist.

Here is the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
