Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the `self.fs.mkdir(d)` line. It seems like the code is trying to create a directory using a non-existing method `mkdir` on an object `self.fs`.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to call a non-existing method `mkdir` on the `self.fs` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `self.fs` object has a `mkdir` method, and if not, use the appropriate method to create a directory.
2. Import the necessary module to use the `mkdir` method, or use the `os` module to create the directory.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)  # use os.makedirs to create the directory
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
