The potential error location within the `move` function is in the conditional check `if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path)`. This error occurs because the condition checks if `raise_if_exists` is `True` and also if `os.path.exists(new_path)` is `True`. However, the given test case provides a runtime value of `False` for `raise_if_exists`, so the condition will never be met and the `if` block will never execute. This means that there is no logic to handle the case where `raise_if_exists` is `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the condition check or else add a condition to handle the case where `raise_if_exists` is `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function that handles the case where `raise_if_exists` is `False`:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)

    if not raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        return  # Do nothing if destination exists and raise_if_exists is False

    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
