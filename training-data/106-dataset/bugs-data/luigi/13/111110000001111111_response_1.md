The potential error in the given `move` function is that the variable `d` is not being calculated properly. Since the value of `d` is crucial for creating the directory if it does not exist, an incorrect value of `d` can cause the function to fail.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the directory name `d` is not taking into account the case where `new_path` might not have a directory component.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `new_path` might not have a directory component. We can use the `os.makedirs` function to create the directory recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)  # Use os.makedirs instead of self.fs.mkdir to create the directory recursively
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `new_path` does not have a directory component and create the necessary directories before moving the file.
