Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to access the `fs` attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `move` method is trying to access the `fs` attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` object, but the `fs` attribute does not exist in the `LocalFileSystem` class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can directly use the `mkdir` method of the `LocalFileSystem` class instead of trying to access the `fs` attribute. Additionally, we need to import the necessary modules such as `os` to properly utilize functions like `os.path.exists` and `os.path.dirname`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    # ... omitted code ...

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)  # Using the mkdir method directly
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
