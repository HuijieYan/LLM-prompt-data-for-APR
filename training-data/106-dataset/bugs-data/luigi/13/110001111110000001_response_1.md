The error message indicates an AttributeError, stating that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'. This points to a potential error location in the move function within the LocalFileSystem class.

The bug occurred because the move function is attempting to access 'self.fs' which does not exist. The 'fs' attribute does not seem to be a part of the LocalFileSystem class, hence causing the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we should directly call the mkdir method without referencing 'self.fs' since 'fs' does not exist as an attribute of the LocalFileSystem class.

```python
import os

class LocalFileSystem:
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With the corrected code, the move function directly calls the mkdir method without referencing 'self.fs'. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and correct the bug in the move function.
