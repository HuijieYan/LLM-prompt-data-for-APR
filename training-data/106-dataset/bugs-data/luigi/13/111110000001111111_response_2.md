The bug is occurring in the "move" function of the LocalFileSystem class. The function is trying to move a file from the old_path to the new_path, but if raise_if_exists is True and the new_path already exists, it should raise a RuntimeError. 

The bug occurs because the function is using "os.path.exists" to check if the new_path exists, but it is not importing the "os" module at the beginning of the file. 

To fix the bug, we need to import the "os" module at the beginning of the file, after which the function should work as expected. 

Here's the corrected code for the "move" function:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
