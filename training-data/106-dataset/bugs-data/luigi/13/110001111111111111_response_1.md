The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs', which means the code is attempting to access 'fs' attribute on the 'LocalFileSystem' object, but it does not exist.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
self.fs.mkdir(d)
```
The code is trying to access 'fs' attribute on 'self', assuming 'self' is an instance of 'LocalFileSystem', but the 'fs' attribute does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that 'self' is already an instance of 'LocalFileSystem', so there is no need to access 'fs' attribute on 'self'.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to remove the unnecessary 'fs' attribute access and directly call the 'mkdir' method on 'self' (which is an instance of 'LocalFileSystem').

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from luigi.file import LocalFileSystem

class CustomLocalFileSystem(LocalFileSystem):
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

The updated code now directly calls the 'mkdir' method on 'self' and removes the unnecessary 'fs' attribute access. This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError.
