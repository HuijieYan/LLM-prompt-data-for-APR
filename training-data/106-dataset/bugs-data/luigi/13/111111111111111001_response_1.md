The error occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` inside the `move` function of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The error message indicates that the `LocalFileSystem` object has no attribute 'fs', which is consistent with the fact that 'fs' is not defined in the `LocalFileSystem` class or any of its parent classes.

The reason for this bug is that 'fs' is an undefined attribute being accessed using 'self.fs'. It seems like the intention was to use 'self' instead of 'self.fs' to access the 'mkdir' function of the same class.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use 'self.mkdir(d)' instead of 'self.fs.mkdir(d)'.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalFileSystem(FileSystem):
    """
    Wrapper for access to file system operations.
    
    Work in progress - add things as needed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def exists(self, path):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # corrected function
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
