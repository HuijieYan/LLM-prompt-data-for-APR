The error occurs in the `move` function of the `LocalFileSystem` class. The `AttributeError` is raised because the function is trying to access `self.fs` which is not defined in the class.

The bug in the `move` function is due to the incorrect usage of `self.fs` instead of just `self`. The `LocalFileSystem` class is itself the filesystem, so there is no need to reference `self.fs`.

Here's the corrected `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Fixed - changed self.fs.mkdir(d) to self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By making this change, the `move` function will now correctly use the `mkdir` function within the `LocalFileSystem` class using `self.mkdir(d)` instead of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. This should resolve the `AttributeError` when running the test.
