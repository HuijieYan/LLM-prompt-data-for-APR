The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being referenced in the 'move' method. This suggests that the 'self.fs' in the 'move' method is incorrect.

The potential error location is within the 'move' method where 'self.fs' is being referenced.

The bug occurred because 'self.fs' is not a valid attribute of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.

To fix this bug, we need to replace 'self.fs' with 'self' as it is already referencing the 'LocalFileSystem' object within the class.

Below is the corrected code for the 'move' method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By using 'self.mkdir(d)' instead of 'self.fs.mkdir(d)', we are directly invoking the 'mkdir' method of the 'LocalFileSystem' class.
