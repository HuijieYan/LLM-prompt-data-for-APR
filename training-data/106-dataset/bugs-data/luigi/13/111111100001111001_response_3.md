The potential error in the `move` method is that when `raise_if_exists` is False, the function does not check if the destination already exists before attempting to move the file. This can result in unintentional overwriting of the destination file.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the destination exists when `raise_if_exists` is False, and if it does, either raise an error or handle the situation in some way.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists:
        if os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    else:
        if os.path.exists(new_path):
            # Handle the situation where the destination exists, e.g. by renaming the destination file
            new_path = make_unique_path(new_path)  # assuming a function make_unique_path exists

    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, when `raise_if_exists` is False and the destination already exists, the function can handle the situation in a custom way. One approach could be to create a unique file name for the destination file to avoid overwriting it. This can be done by calling a hypothetical `make_unique_path` function. If the destination does not exist, the function proceeds to move the file as intended.
