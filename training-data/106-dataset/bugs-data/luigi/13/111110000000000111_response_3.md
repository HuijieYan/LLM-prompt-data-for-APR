Potential Error:

The potential error in the code is with the `move` function. It seems that the function is intended to move a file from `old_path` to `new_path`, but there are issues with error checking and handling.

Reasons for the Bug:

The `move` function does not handle the case where the destination path already exists (`raise_if_exists=True`). It also does not handle the case where the parent directory of the new_path does not exist.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Check if the destination path already exists and raise an error if `raise_if_exists=True`.
2. Check if the parent directory of the new path exists and create it if it doesn't.
3. Use OS-specific file operations to move the file.

Corrected Code:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
  
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Change self.fs.mkdir to self.mkdir

    # Use OS-specific file operations to move the file
    shutil.move(old_path, new_path)
```
