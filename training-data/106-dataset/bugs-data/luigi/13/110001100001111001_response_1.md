The bug in the `move` function is that it does not properly handle the case when the destination directory does not exist. 

The error message "Destination exists: %s" is raised when `raise_if_exists` is True and the `new_path` already exists. 

The potential error location is in the if statement checking if the destination exists. 

The bug occurs because the function does not check if the directory of the new path exists before trying to move the file. 

To fix the bug, we should check if the destination directory `d` exists and create it if it does not before attempting to move the file.

Here is the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)

    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d, parents=True)  # check and create the directory if it doesn't exist

    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
