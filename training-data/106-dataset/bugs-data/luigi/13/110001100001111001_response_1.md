Potential Error Location: The potential error in the buggy function is at the line `os.rename(old_path, new_path)`.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs when the `move` function is called with `raise_if_exists` set to `False` and there is already an existing file at the `new_path`. In this case, the function should not raise an error, but simply overwrite the existing file.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `raise_if_exists` is `True`, then raise an error.
2. If `raise_if_exists` is `False`, then check if the file exists at the `new_path` and delete it before renaming the old file to the new path.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_13/luigi/file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def exists(self, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def mkdir(self, path, parents=True, raise_if_exists=False):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    if os.path.exists(new_path):
        os.remove(new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
