1. The test case is trying to move a file from one location to another using the `self.fs.move` method. However, the error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to access the 'fs' attribute of the LocalFileSystem object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.fs` as it is causing an AttributeError.

3. The bug occurred because the `move` method is assuming that the LocalFileSystem object has an attribute named 'fs', which is not the case.

4. To fix the bug, we can directly use the `self` reference in the `move` method instead of accessing it through the `fs` attribute. Additionally, we need to import the necessary modules (e.g., os) for the `move` method to work properly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By making these changes, we resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure that the `move` method works as intended.
