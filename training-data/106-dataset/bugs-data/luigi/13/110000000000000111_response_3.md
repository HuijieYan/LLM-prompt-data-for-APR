Potential Error: The error could occur if the new_path already exists and the raise_if_exists parameter is set to True.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function does not check for the existence of the new_path before attempting to move the file. If the raise_if_exists parameter is set to True, it should raise an exception if the new_path already exists.

Approach to Fix the Bug: We need to add a check to see if the new_path already exists before attempting to move the file. If the new_path exists and raise_if_exists is True, then raise an exception. Otherwise, proceed with the move operation.

Corrected Function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists:
        if os.path.exists(new_path):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
