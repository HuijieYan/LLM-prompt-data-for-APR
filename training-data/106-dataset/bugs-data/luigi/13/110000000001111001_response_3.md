The potential error in the given code is the use of `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. This seems to be referencing a file system object within a class (self), but it's not clear from the provided code what `self.fs` is or where it comes from. This could potentially be causing the bug.

The error message "Destination exists: %s" suggests that the destination already exists and the function is trying to move a file to an existing location when `raise_if_exists` is True.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if `raise_if_exists` is True and if `new_path` already exists before attempting to move the file.
2. Instead of using `self.fs.mkdir(d)`, check if the directory `d` exists and if not, create it using `os.makedirs(d)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
        
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

This updated code checks if `new_path` exists and if `raise_if_exists` is True, raises an error. It then uses `os.makedirs` instead of `self.fs.mkdir` to create the directory if it doesn't exist.
