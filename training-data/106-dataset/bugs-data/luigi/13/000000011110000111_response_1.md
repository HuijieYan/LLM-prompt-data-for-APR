The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the `move` method of the `LocalFileSystem` object, specifically at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. This suggests that there is no attribute `fs` in the `LocalFileSystem` object.

The potential error location within the `move` method is the usage of `self.fs` instead of `self` directly. It seems that the code is attempting to call a method `mkdir` on an attribute `fs` that does not exist.

The bug occurred because the `move` method is attempting to use `self.fs` to call the `mkdir` method, but `LocalFileSystem` does not have an attribute named `fs`. 

To fix this bug, simply remove the `.fs` prefix from the `mkdir` method call within the `move` method.

The corrected code for the `move` method:
```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # Fixed line: removed .fs prefix
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
