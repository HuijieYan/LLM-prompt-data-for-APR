The potential error in the `move` function is that the variable `d` is being used before it is assigned a value. This is likely the cause of the error.

To fix this, we can assign a value to `d` before using it in the `if` condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)  # Assigning a value to d here
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
