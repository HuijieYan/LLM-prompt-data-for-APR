The error occurs in the `move` method because it tries to access `self.fs`, which does not exist. This is evident from the error message: `AttributeError: 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'`.

The reason for this error is that the `move` method is trying to access `self.fs`, but `fs` is not a property or attribute of the `LocalFileSystem` class.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the `self.fs` and directly use `os` module for filesystem operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` method:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the `move` method should now work as expected without trying to access `self.fs`.
