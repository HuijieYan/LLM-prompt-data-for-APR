The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the new directory for the new_path does not exist. This can lead to an error when trying to move the file to a non-existent directory.

The bug occurs because the function tries to move the old_path to the new_path without checking if the directory of the new_path exists. It assumes that the directory already exists, which can cause the 'FileNotFoundError' if it doesn't.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the directory of the new_path exists, and if it doesn't, create the directory before moving the file.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)  # create the directory if it doesn't exist
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

In the corrected code, the `os.makedirs(d)` function is used to create the directory recursively if it doesn't exist. This ensures that the new directory for the new_path is created before moving the file to the new_path.
