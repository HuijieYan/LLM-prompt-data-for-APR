Potential Bug Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement that checks if the destination path exists. 

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the if statement checks for the existence of the new_path directly using `os.path.exists(new_path)` without considering the case where new_path is a directory.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by using `os.path.isdir(new_path)` to check if the new_path is a directory instead of checking its existence directly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
    def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
        if raise_if_exists and (os.path.exists(new_path) or os.path.isdir(new_path)):
            raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
        d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
        if d and not os.path.exists(d):
            self.fs.mkdir(d)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
