The bug in the `move` function is that the variable `d` is being referenced before being assigned a value. This will result in an error, as `d` is not defined.

To fix the bug, the code should first assign a value to the variable `d` by getting the directory name of `new_path`, and then check if it exists before attempting to create it. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
