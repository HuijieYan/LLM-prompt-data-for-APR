Potential error location: 

The potential error location is in the line `d = os.path.dirname(new_path)` and the subsequent `if` condition. If `new_path` does not contain any directory path, then `os.path.dirname(new_path)` will return an empty string, and the subsequent `if` condition `if d and not os.path.exists(d):` will evaluate to `if '' and not os.path.exists(''):` which will not behave as intended.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the code assumes that `os.path.dirname(new_path)` will always return a valid directory path, but it does not account for the case when `new_path` does not contain a directory path.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

We can fix the bug by handling the case when `os.path.dirname(new_path)` returns an empty string separately. We can use the `os.makedirs()` function to create the directory path if it does not exist.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
    
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
