The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the use of the `os.rename` function. When the `raise_if_exists` parameter is `False` and the `new_path` already exists, the function should not raise an error but instead overwrite the existing file. 

To fix this bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Remove the condition `if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):` and the corresponding error raising statement.
2. Instead, use the `shutil.move` function to move the file, which will automatically overwrite the existing file if `new_path` already exists.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import shutil

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if not raise_if_exists:
        if os.path.exists(new_path):
            os.remove(new_path)  # Remove the existing file
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    shutil.move(old_path, new_path)  # Use shutil.move to move the file
```

With these changes, the function should handle the case where `raise_if_exists` is `False` and `new_path` already exists, by removing the existing file and then moving the file from `old_path` to `new_path`.
