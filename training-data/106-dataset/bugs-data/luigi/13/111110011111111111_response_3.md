The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called in the move function.

Upon analysis, it is evident that the error is occurring because 'self.fs' is being called instead of just 'self' within the move function. This is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the '.fs' from 'self.fs.mkdir(d)' in the move function. The correct way to call the mkdir function is 'self.mkdir(d)'.

Here's the corrected code for the move function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

By making this change, the AttributeError should be resolved and the move function should work as intended.
