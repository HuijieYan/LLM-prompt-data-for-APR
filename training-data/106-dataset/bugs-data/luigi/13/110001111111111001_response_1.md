The error message indicates that the 'LocalFileSystem' object does not have an attribute 'fs', which is being called when the function tries to create the directory. This suggests that the issue is with the way the 'self.fs' attribute is being accessed within the 'move' method.

The bug occurs because the 'move' method is trying to access the 'fs' attribute directly from 'self', but it should actually be accessing it directly, not as an attribute of 'self'.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` to `self.mkdir(d)`.

Here's the corrected code for the 'move' method:

```python
import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this change, the 'move' method should correctly create the directory using the 'mkdir' method from the same object, fixing the attribute error.
