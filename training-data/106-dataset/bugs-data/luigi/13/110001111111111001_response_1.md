The error message indicates an AttributeError, specifically that the 'LocalFileSystem' object has no attribute 'fs'. This suggests that the code is trying to access an attribute 'fs' within the 'LocalFileSystem' object, which does not exist.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)`. The 'fs' attribute is being accessed on the 'LocalFileSystem' object 'self', which is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the bug is that there is no 'fs' attribute within the 'LocalFileSystem' object. It seems that the intention was to call the 'mkdir' function directly on the 'LocalFileSystem' object, but it is currently being accessed through a non-existent 'fs' attribute.

To fix the bug, the code should directly call the 'mkdir' function on the 'self' (which is the 'LocalFileSystem' object) without the 'fs' attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the 'move' function:

```python
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        self.mkdir(d)  # calling the 'mkdir' function directly on the 'LocalFileSystem' object
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
