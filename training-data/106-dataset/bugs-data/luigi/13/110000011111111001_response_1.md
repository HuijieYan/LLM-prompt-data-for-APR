The error occurs at the line `self.fs.mkdir(d)` because the `LocalFileSystem` object does not have an attribute `fs`. This means the code is trying to access a non-existent attribute, leading to an `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `self.fs` reference and directly call the `mkdir` method on the `LocalFileSystem` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
import os

def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.exists(d):
        os.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```

With this correction, the code should no longer try to access the non-existent attribute `fs` and should work as intended.
