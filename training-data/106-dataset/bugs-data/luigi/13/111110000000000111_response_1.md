The potential error in the `move` function is with the `os.path.exists(new_path)` check. The `os.path.exists()` method checks for the existence of the file or directory, but it may return true for both files and directories. So, even if `new_path` exists as a directory, the check would pass and the `os.rename()` function would fail as it cannot replace a directory with a file.

To fix this bug, we can use `os.path.isfile(new_path)` to specifically check if `new_path` is a file, and if so, raise an error. Additionally, we need to update the `os.path.exists(d)` check to `os.path.isdir(d)` to check if the parent directory exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `move` function:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
def move(self, old_path, new_path, raise_if_exists=False):
    if raise_if_exists and os.path.exists(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('Destination exists: %s' % new_path)
    
    if os.path.isfile(new_path):
        raise RuntimeError('File already exists at the destination: %s' % new_path)

    d = os.path.dirname(new_path)
    if d and not os.path.isdir(d):
        self.fs.mkdir(d)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)
```
