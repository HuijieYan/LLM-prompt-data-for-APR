The potential error in the provided function is in the line:
options=self.copy_options

The bug occurs because the copy_options() method is not being called and its value is not being provided for the options variable in the cursor.execute() method.

To fix the bug, the copy_options() method should be called to get the options value and provide it to the cursor.execute() method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options method to get the options value
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Provide the copy_options value to the options variable
    )
```

In the corrected code, the copy_options() method is called and its value is assigned to the copy_options variable, which is then provided to the cursor.execute() method for the options variable. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct options are used for the COPY command.
