The error occurs in the `copy` function when the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if it's None or not. As seen from the provided test function, the `columns` parameter of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is being passed as `None`. This causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when the length of `self.columns` is checked.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we ensure that the program doesn't attempt to get the length of `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring. This change will prevent the bug from occurring and allow the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
