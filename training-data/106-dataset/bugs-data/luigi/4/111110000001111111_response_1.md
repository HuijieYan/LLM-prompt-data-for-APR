The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check for the length of self.columns. The code is currently checking for the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns exists, leading to a TypeError when self.columns is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is assuming self.columns will always be present and non-empty, leading to an error when it is None.

To fix the bug, the code needs to first check if self.columns exists and then proceed to check its length. If it doesn't exist, it should default to an empty string for colnames.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if self.columns exists and then proceed to check its length before constructing the colnames variable. This change prevents the TypeError when self.columns is None.
