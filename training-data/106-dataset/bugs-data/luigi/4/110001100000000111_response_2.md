Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring in the line where the length of self.columns is checked. If self.columns is None, then trying to access its length will result in a TypeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if self.columns is None before attempting to access its length. When self.columns is None, the code should handle this case without trying to access its length.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that self.columns is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None.
