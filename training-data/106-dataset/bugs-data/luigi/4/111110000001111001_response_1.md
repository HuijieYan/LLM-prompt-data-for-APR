The potential error in the given code is in the `cursor.execute` statement inside the `copy` method. The `self.copy_options` is missing parentheses to call the method.

The bug occurred because the `copy_options` method is not called correctly when formatting the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}()
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the parentheses to properly call the `copy_options` method, the bug in the `copy` method should be fixed.
