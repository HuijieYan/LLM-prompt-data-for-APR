1. The test case creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with a `None` value for the `columns` attribute and then runs the task. The error occurs when the `copy` method is called within the `run` method, specifically at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` method.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is `None`, so calling `len` on `None` raises a `TypeError`. The `copy` method is expecting `self.columns` to be a list or another type for which `len` can be called.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` within the `copy` method. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` line checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` was `None`.
