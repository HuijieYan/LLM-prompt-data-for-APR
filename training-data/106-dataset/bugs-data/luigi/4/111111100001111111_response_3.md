The issue seems to be that the code is not handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

The potential error location is here:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The error message indicates that the code is trying to get the length of a None type, which is not allowed.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
