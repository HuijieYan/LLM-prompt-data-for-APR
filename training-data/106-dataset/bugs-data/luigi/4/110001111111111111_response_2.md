The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` which causes the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition to fail with a `TypeError`. This occurs in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. We can do this by using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This way, if `self.columns` is None, the condition will short-circuit and the length check will not be performed, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `TypeError` should be resolved and the Redshift COPY should work as expected when columns are not provided.
