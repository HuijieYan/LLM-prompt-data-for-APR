Potential error location: The potential error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` within the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This error occurs because the `columns` attribute is `None`, which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `copy` method is trying to access the length of the `columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError`, as `NoneType` does not have a length.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before accessing its length.
2. Provide a default value for `columns` if it is `None` to avoid the `TypeError`.

Corrected code for the `copy` method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In this corrected code, the `if` condition has been updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `columns` is not `None`. Additionally, the `self.copy_options` method is called with parentheses to ensure its return value is used in the string formatting.
