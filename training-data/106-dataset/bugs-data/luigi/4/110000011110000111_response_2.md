Potential error location: 
The potential error location is the if statement within the copy() function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Reason behind the bug:
The error occurs because the if statement is checking the length of self.columns without first checking if self.columns is not None. If self.columns is None, then checking its length would result in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length.
2. Handle the case when self.columns is None separately.

Corrected code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
