The potential error in the provided function is in the `cursor.execute` call. The string formatting for the SQL query is missing a closing parenthesis and curly brace.

The bug occurred because the string formatting for the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call is missing a closing parenthesis and curly brace, causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to add a closing parenthesis and curly brace to the string formatting for the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
