The error occurred because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, and the buggy function is trying to call the `len()` function on it. This causes a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a `len()`.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check whether `self.columns` is `None`, and if it is, we should set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
