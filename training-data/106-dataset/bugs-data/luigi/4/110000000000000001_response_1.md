Potential error location: The error is likely within the cursor.execute() method call.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is caused by a missing closing parenthesis in the cursor.execute() method call, resulting in a syntax error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a closing parenthesis at the end of the cursor.execute() method to fix the syntax error.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
