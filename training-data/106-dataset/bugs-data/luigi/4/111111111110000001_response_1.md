The error occurs because the `copy` function checks the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not None. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. If it is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the error.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. If it is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string. Otherwise, we proceed with accessing its length and building the `colnames` string accordingly.
