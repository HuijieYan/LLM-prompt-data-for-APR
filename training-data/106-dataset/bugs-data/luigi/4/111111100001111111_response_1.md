3. Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. When `self.columns` is None, the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` throws a TypeError because it is trying to call len() on a NoneType object.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. We can use a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
