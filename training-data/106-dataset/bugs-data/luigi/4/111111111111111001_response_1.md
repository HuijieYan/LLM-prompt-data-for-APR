The error occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue is with the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, where the function is trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object. This is causing a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected function, we add the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. Additionally, we also invoke the `self.copy_options()` method to ensure the correct options are used in the `cursor.execute` call.
