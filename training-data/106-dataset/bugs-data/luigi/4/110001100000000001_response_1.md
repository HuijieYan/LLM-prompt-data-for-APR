Potential error location: 
The error is likely to occur in the format of the `cursor.execute` method call, as the `options` argument is missing parentheses after `self.copy_options`.

Reason behind the bug: 
The bug occurred because the `options` argument was not properly formatted when passed to the `cursor.execute` method, resulting in a syntax error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `copy_options` method should be called to retrieve the options and then passed with parentheses to the `cursor.execute` method.

Corrected code:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
```
