Potential error location: The bug is likely in the `cursor.execute` call where the SQL query is being formatted.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable might be empty, and if it is, then there will be an extra comma in the SQL query.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can check if `colnames` is empty before including it in the SQL query.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = " " + colnames  # add a space before colnames

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In the corrected code, we check if `colnames` is not empty before including it in the SQL query. If it's not empty, we add a space before `colnames` to avoid an extra comma in the query.
