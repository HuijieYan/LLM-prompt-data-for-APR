The potential error in the `copy` function is with the `options=self.copy_options` line. It seems that `copy_options` is a method, and it should be called as `self.copy_options()` to return the actual options.

The bug occurred because the `copy_options` method is not being called properly. The function should call the method to get the options for the COPY command to be executed.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the options string. Then, we can use that string in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the method to get the options
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the options string in the execute call
    )
```
