The error occurs due to checking the length of self.columns without first checking if it is not None. The error message indicates that the TypeError is happening at line 338 which is the if statement related to self.columns. Since columns=None is explicitly being passed in the test case, it is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if self.columns is not None before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when columns are explicitly set to None.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of self.columns if it is not None. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring when columns are explicitly set to None.
