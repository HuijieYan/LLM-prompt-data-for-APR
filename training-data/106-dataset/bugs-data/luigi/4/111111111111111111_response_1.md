The error "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" occurs in the function `copy` of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error is being caused by the check `if len(self.columns) > 0` which is trying to get the length of `self.columns` when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. Additionally, we also invoked `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options` to call the method and obtain its return value.
