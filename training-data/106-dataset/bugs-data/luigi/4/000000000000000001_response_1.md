Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the missing 'with' clause in the cursor.execute statement. The 'with' clause is used to open a file and ensure its proper closing, which seems to be missing in the provided code.

Reason for the bug: The missing 'with' clause can lead to resource leaks and potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Approach for fixing the bug: Adding a 'with' clause to the cursor.execute statement to properly open and close the file.

Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    with open(f, 'r') as file:
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=file.name,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
