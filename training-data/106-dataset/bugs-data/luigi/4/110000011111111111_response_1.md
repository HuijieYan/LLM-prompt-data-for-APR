The error is occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` within the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The error is due to the fact that `self.columns` is `None`, and the code is attempting to call `len` on a `None` type. 

To fix this bug, we can simply check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This can be achieved by changing the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to check the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
