The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect formatting of the COPY command in the cursor.execute() method. It seems that the colnames variable is not being used correctly in the query construction, and it is not being passed to the query as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the colnames variable is being constructed properly but not incorporated into the query string.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the colnames variable is correctly used in the query string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import logging

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, I added the logger setup, and fixed the usage of the colnames variable in the cursor.execute() method by including it in the query string. Now the function should work as expected and properly execute the COPY command with the provided parameters.
