The error occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. The code should be modified to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The correction involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, the conditional statement will not proceed to check its length, thus avoiding the error. Additionally, `self.copy_options` should be called as a method `self.copy_options()` instead of just accessing the attribute.
