The error occurred due to the NoneType error raised when trying to get the length of the 'columns' attribute in the 'copy' method of the 'S3CopyToTable' class.

The 'columns' attribute is expected to be a list, and its length is being checked in the 'copy' method. However, in the test case provided, the 'columns' attribute is set to 'None', leading to the NoneType error when checking its length.

To fix this bug, the 'copy' method should first verify if 'self.columns' is not None before attempting to get its length. If 'self.columns' is None, it should handle this case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'copy' method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, 'self.columns' is first checked for None before attempting to get its length. If it is not None, then its length is checked as before. If it is None, then 'colnames' remains an empty string, as in the original code.
