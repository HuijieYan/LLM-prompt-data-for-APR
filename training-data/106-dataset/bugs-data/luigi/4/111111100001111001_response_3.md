The bug in the given code is in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self.copy_options` is called as a method but it should be called as a function. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is not used in the `COPY` statement, so it is unnecessary.

The bug occurred because the `self.copy_options` function was not correctly called in the `cursor.execute` statement, and the `colnames` variable was included unnecessarily.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` function correctly and remove the unnecessary `colnames` variable from the `COPY` statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, `self.copy_options` is called as a function with `()` and the unnecessary `colnames` variable is removed from the `COPY` statement.
