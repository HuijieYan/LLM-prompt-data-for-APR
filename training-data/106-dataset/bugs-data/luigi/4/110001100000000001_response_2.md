Potential error location: The error is likely in the cursor.execute() method, where the placeholders are not properly formatted or the values are not correctly passed.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring due to incorrect formatting of the string inside the cursor.execute() method. The placeholders for table, colnames, source, creds, and options are not being replaced with their respective values properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use placeholders and pass the values separately to the cursor.execute() method to avoid formatting issues.
2. Ensure that the values passed to the cursor.execute() method are correctly formatted and aligned with the placeholders in the query string.
3. Check that the self._credentials() and self.copy_options() methods are returning the expected values.

Corrected code:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {} {} from '{}' CREDENTIALS '{}' {}
         ;""".format(
            self.table,
            colnames,
            f,
            self._credentials(),
            self.copy_options())
        )
```
