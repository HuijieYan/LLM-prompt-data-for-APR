The potential error in the provided function is in the cursor.execute() call. There are a few issues with the code:
1. The `self.copy_options` is missing parentheses, causing it not to be called as intended.
2. It seems like the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions are intended to return some string values to be used in the `COPY` command, but they are defined like methods and not called as part of the `COPY` command string.

To fix the function, we need to call the `_credentials` and `copy_options` functions to get the required strings, and fix the missing parentheses for `self.copy_options`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected code, `self._credentials` and `self.copy_options` are called as functions to get their string values for the `COPY` command, and the missing parentheses for `self.copy_options` are added.
