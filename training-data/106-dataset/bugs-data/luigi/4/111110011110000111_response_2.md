The error occurs because the `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's not None. This causes a TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None and then proceed with checking its length.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this modification, the code now checks if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length, preventing the TypeError.
