The issue with the provided function is that it tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we added a check for `self.columns` to be not `None` before accessing its length, which should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original function.
