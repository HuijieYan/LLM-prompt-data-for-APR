Potential Error:
The potential error is in the cursor.execute() function where the SQL query is not properly formatted.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the SQL query is not properly formatted within the cursor.execute() function. The placeholders for table, colnames, source, creds, and options are not being substituted with the actual values.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection and ensure proper substitution of placeholders.
2. Check for any missing or incorrect placeholders in the SQL query.

Corrected Function:
```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(options=self.copy_options), (self.table, colnames, f, self._credentials()))
```
