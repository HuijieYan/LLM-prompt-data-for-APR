The potential error in the provided function is in the line that checks the length of self.columns. The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates that self.columns is set to None and we are trying to find the length of None.

The bug occurs because when self.columns is not provided (i.e., set to None), the code does not check if it exists before trying to access its length.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of self.columns to handle the case when it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check "if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:", we can prevent the TypeError when self.columns is None. This change ensures that we only try to access the length of self.columns when it actually exists and is not None.
