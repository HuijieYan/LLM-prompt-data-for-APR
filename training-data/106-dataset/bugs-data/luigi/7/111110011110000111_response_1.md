The error occurs in the `test_status_wont_override` test case. The test case first adds a task with worker 'X' and task_id 'A' and then tries to add the same task with worker 'Y' and status UNKNOWN. However, the assertion fails because the task 'A' is expected to be in the set of tasks with a status of RUNNING, but it's not.

The potential error location within the `add_task` method is the section that handles the update of task status. It seems that the status update logic is causing the task status to be set to UNKNOWN even when it is not intended.

The bug occurs because the logic to update the task status is not properly handling the UNKNOWN status. As a result, it is causing unexpected behavior in the scheduler and leading to failed assertions in the test case.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `add_task` method for handling the status update needs to be carefully reviewed and updated to handle the UNKNOWN status properly. The conditions under which the status is updated should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that the status reflects the actual state of the task.

Here is the corrected `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # Existing logic goes here

    if status == UNKNOWN and task.status == RUNNING:
        return  # Do not update the status to UNKNOWN if the task is currently running

    if status != task.status:
        # Update the DB only if there was an actual change, to prevent noise
        self._update_task_history(task, status)

    if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # Existing logic goes here
```

In the corrected code, the logic has been updated to check if the new status is UNKNOWN and the task is currently running. If this is the case, the status is not updated. Additionally, the logic to update the task status has been modified to ensure that the update only occurs when there is an actual change in status.
