The test case "test_status_wont_override" seems to be checking if the status of a task can be overridden by another worker. The test adds a task with worker X and then tries to override the status of the same task with worker Y.

The error message indicates that the test is expecting the task 'A' to be in the running state, but it's not found in the running state as per the test's expectation.

The potential error in the code is the logic that handles task status and updates. There could be issues related to setting the status and updating the state of the tasks.

The bug seems to be related to how the status of a task is being handled and updated in the "add_task" method. It appears that the status is not being updated correctly, leading to discrepancies when trying to override the status.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the status of a task based on worker actions should be carefully reviewed and updated. Also, careful consideration should be given to how tasks are added and managed by different workers.

Here's a corrected version of the "add_task" method:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self.get_worker(worker_id)

    if not worker.enabled:
        return  # Return if the worker is not enabled

    task = self.get_task(task_id, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id))

    if task is None or (task.status != 'RUNNING' and not worker.enabled):
        return  # Return if the task is not found or if it's not running and worker is not enabled

    # Update the task status only if there's an actual change
    if status != task.status:
        # Perform status updates and history tracking
        self.set_status(task, status, config=self._config)
        self._update_task_history(task, status)

    #... (other logic)

    # Update other task attributes as needed

    #...
    
    if runnable and status not in ['FAILED', 'SUSPENDED'] and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the logic for updating the task status and history. We also check for the worker's enabled status before making updates. Additionally, we perform status updates based on actual changes and handle other task attributes accordingly.
