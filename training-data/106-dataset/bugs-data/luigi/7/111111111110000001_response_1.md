The test function is trying to add a task with status "UNKNOWN" with the same task_id that was previously added with a different worker and status. The assertion is checking for the presence of task_id 'A' in the list of tasks with status 'RUNNING', which fails.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of task status updates and comparisons.

The bug occurs because the function `add_task` does not handle the updating of task status properly. It overwrites the previous status with the new one, which causes inconsistencies when checking the status of tasks in the scheduler.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `add_task` function to only update the status of a task if the new status is different from the current status, and also to handle the case where a task with the same task_id is added by a different worker.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True, deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None, assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None,
             batchable=None, batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # Check if the task exists and if it has the same worker running
    if self._state.get_task(task_id) is not None and self._state.get_task(task_id).worker_running != worker:
        return

    # ... (other unchanged code)

    if not (task.status in (RUNNING, BATCH_RUNNING) and status == PENDING) or new_deps:
        # only update task status if it's different from the current status
        if status != task.status:
            self._update_task_history(task, status)
            self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # ... (other unchanged code)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the task exists and if it has the same worker running before attempting to update its status. If these conditions are not met, the function returns early without making any changes. Additionally, the status update logic has been modified to only update the status if it's different from the current status.
