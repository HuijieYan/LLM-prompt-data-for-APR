The test case `test_status_wont_override()` is trying to add a task with the status `UNKNOWN` using the `add_task()` method of the `Scheduler` class. It then expects the task with status `RUNNING` to be overridden by the new task with status `UNKNOWN`.

The potential error in the `add_task()` method is related to how it handles the status update for existing tasks. The method first checks if the task exists and then updates the task's status. However, it may not correctly handle the scenario where the status is being updated to `UNKNOWN` from an existing status like `RUNNING`.

The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle the specific case where the status of an existing task is being updated to `UNKNOWN`. This causes the incorrect behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `add_task()` method should be modified to correctly handle the scenario where the status of an existing task is being updated to `UNKNOWN`. Additionally, it should ensure that the status is updated properly and consistently.

Here's the corrected `add_task()` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None:  # If task doesn't exist, create it with the specified status
        task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=status, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:  # If task exists, update its status and other attributes
        task.status = status
        task.deps = deps if deps is not None else task.deps
        # Update other task attributes as needed
        # ...
    
    # The rest of the method including updating the task history, stakeholders, priority, etc. will remain the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected method, we first check if the task already exists. If it does, we simply update its status and other attributes as needed. If the task doesn't exist, we create a new task with the specified status and attributes. This ensures that the status is updated correctly and consistently, addressing the bug identified in the test case.
