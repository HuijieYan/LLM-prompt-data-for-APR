Potential Error Location:
The error may occur throughout the `add_task` function due to various condition checks and status updates.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the function's incorrect handling of the task status and dependencies. The function updates the task status to UNKNOWN under certain conditions, which can lead to incorrect reflections of the task status in the central scheduler. This can result in tasks running multiple times at once and not accurately representing the actual state of the tasks.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the conditions that update the task status to UNKNOWN based on certain worker conditions.
2. Ensure that the task status accurately reflects the actual state of the task and is not subject to unnecessary updates.
3. Implement a more reliable method for handling task dependencies and status updates, considering the impact on the central scheduler.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
This corrected function removes the updates of the task status to UNKNOWN based on worker conditions, ensuring that the task status accurately reflects the actual state of the task and is not subject to unnecessary updates.
