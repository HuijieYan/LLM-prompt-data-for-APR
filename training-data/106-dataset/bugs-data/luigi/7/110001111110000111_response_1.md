The test case `test_status_wont_override` is trying to assert that when a task with status 'UNKNOWN' is added, it should not override the existing task status. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing because the task 'A' is in the first set but not in the second set.

The potential error location within the `add_task` method can be identified as the logic for handling the status update of the task.

The bug occurs because when the status of a task is updated to 'UNKNOWN' by a worker, it is not handled properly, leading to incorrect behavior and the task status being overridden.

To fix the bug, the status update logic needs to be revised to ensure that the status of a task is only updated if it meets certain conditions. Additionally, proper handling of the 'UNKNOWN' status and its implications on task scheduling and worker interactions needs to be implemented.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status="PENDING", runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status="PENDING", deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != "RUNNING" and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # Check if the task status should be updated
    if status == "PENDING" or status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)

    if status == "FAILED" and self._config.batch_emails:
        batched_params, _ = self._state.get_batcher(worker_id, family)
        if batched_params:
            unbatched_params = {
                param: value
                for param, value in task.params.items()
                if param not in batched_params
            }
        else:
            unbatched_params = task.params
        try:
            expl_raw = json.loads(expl)
        except ValueError:
            expl_raw = expl

        self._email_batcher.add_failure(
            task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, expl_raw, owners)
        if task.status == "DISABLED":
            self._email_batcher.add_disable(
                task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, owners)

    # Update task status
    self._state.set_status(task, "PENDING" if status == "SUSPENDED" else status, self._config)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        # Task dependencies might not exist yet. Let's create dummy tasks for them for now.
        # Otherwise the task dependencies might end up being pruned if scheduling takes a long time
        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status="UNKNOWN", deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    # Because some tasks (non-dynamic dependencies) are `_make_task`ed
    # before we know their retry_policy, we always set it here
    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != "FAILED" and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

The corrected code includes proper handling of the task status update, conditional checks for status updates, and adjustments to task dependencies and priorities based on worker and task statuses. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the task status is updated appropriately without causing issues in task scheduling.
