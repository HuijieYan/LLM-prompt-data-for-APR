The issue in the `add_task` function seems to be related to the status update. The function updates the status of the task based on certain conditions, such as the worker reaching the task limit, the `complete()` or `deps()` of the task failing, or the task being disabled. However, these updates may not accurately reflect the actual status of the task, especially if they are caused by flaky or local issues.

To fix this bug, it's important to review the logic behind updating the status of the task in the `add_task` function. It might be more appropriate for the status updates to be based on actual task completion or failure, rather than certain conditions that may not reflect the true state of the task.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None:
        return
    
    if status == RUNNING and not task.worker_running:
        task.worker_running = worker_id
        if batch_id:
            task.resources_running = self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(batch_id)[0].resources_running
        task.time_running = time.time()

    if tracking_url is not None or task.status != RUNNING:
        task.tracking_url = tracking_url
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.tracking_url = tracking_url

    if batchable is not None:
        task.batchable = batchable

    if task.remove is not None:
        task.remove = None  # unmark task for removal so it isn't removed after being added

    if expl is not None:
        task.expl = expl
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.expl = expl

    if not (task.status in (RUNNING, BATCH_RUNNING) and status == PENDING) or new_deps:
        if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
            self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    if status == FAILED and self._config.batch_emails:
        batched_params, _ = self._state.get_batcher(worker_id, family)
        if batched_params:
            unbatched_params = {
                param: value
                for param, value in six.iteritems(task.params)
                if param not in batched_params
            }
        else:
            unbatched_params = task.params
        try:
            expl_raw = json.loads(expl)
        except ValueError:
            expl_raw = expl

        self._email_batcher.add_failure(
            task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, expl_raw, owners)
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            self._email_batcher.add_disable(
                task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, owners)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
``` 

In the corrected code, the status updates are based on more specific conditions, such as the task actually running, failing, or being disabled, rather than general worker conditions. This should provide a more accurate representation of the task status and prevent incorrect status updates based on worker conditions.
