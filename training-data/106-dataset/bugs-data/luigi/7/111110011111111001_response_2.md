The bug occurs because the `add_task` function does not handle the case when a task is already running. This causes the function to try and set the status of a task that is already running, leading to unexpected behavior and the test failure.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `add_task` function to check if the task is already running by querying the `_state` for the current status of the task.
2. If the task is already running, it should not be overridden, and an appropriate action must be taken.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, worker, task_id=None, status=PENDING, **kwargs):
    task = self._state.get_task(task_id)
    if task and task.status == RUNNING:
        return  # Do nothing if the task is already running

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, we check if the task is already running, and if it is, we simply return without making any changes. This prevents the status from being incorrectly overridden.

By adding this conditional check, the function will handle the case when a task is already running and avoid attempting to change the status of a running task, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
