The test case `test_status_wont_override` first adds a task with `task_id='A'` for `worker='X'`, asserts that `self.sch.get_work(worker='X')['task_id']` is equal to `'A'`, and then tries to add the same task for `worker='Y'` with `status=UNKNOWN` and asserts that the task is not running. However, based on the provided inputs and outputs, the `add_task` method does not handle the updating of the task status correctly.

It seems that the `add_task` method is expected to update the task status for a specific worker (`worker='Y'` in this case) and task id, but it does not handle this correctly. It leads to the `assertEqual` statement failing in the test case.

The bug in the `add_task` function is that it does not appropriately update the task status for a specific worker and task id when it receives the `status=UNKNOWN` parameter.

To fix this bug, the `add_task` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when a new status is provided. It should find the task based on the task id and then update its status for the specified worker. This way, the correct worker for the specified task id will have the status appropriately updated.

Below is the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
# Buggy function corrected
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # existing code for updating the task status
    if status != task.status:  # If the status really changes
        self._update_task_history(task, status)  # Update history

    self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)
```

In this corrected code, the `add_task` method properly checks for the change in status, updates the task history, and sets the status for the specific task and worker accordingly.

With these changes, the `add_task` method should now correctly update the task status for the specified worker and task id. This should resolve the bug identified in the `test_status_wont_override` test case.
