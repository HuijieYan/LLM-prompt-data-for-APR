The bug in the provided function is that the status `UNKNOWN` is being set on the task by the worker. This status should only be set by the scheduler itself when it encounters a task for the first time as a dependency.

The worker sets the status to `UNKNOWN` in three conditions: 
- when the scheduled tasks reach the task-limit (if the config is set)
- when the `.complete()` of the task fails
- when the `.deps()` of the task fails

The issue with setting the status to `UNKNOWN` in these conditions is that it may not reflect the true state of the task and could lead to incorrect scheduling decisions. There is a risk of a task running multiple times at once if the status is continually overridden by a "bad" worker.

The potential approaches for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Remove the ability for the worker to set the status to `UNKNOWN` in the conditions mentioned above.
2. Implement error handling and reporting in the worker functions to deal with failures in completing tasks or fetching dependencies, rather than setting the status to `UNKNOWN`.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True, deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None, priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None, assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None, batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
        # Update the DB only if there was an actual change, to prevent noise.
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    if status == FAILED and self._config.batch_emails:
        batched_params, _ = self._state.get_batcher(worker_id, family)
        if batched_params:
            unbatched_params = {
                param: value
                for param, value in six.iteritems(task.params)
                if param not in batched_params
            }
        else:
            unbatched_params = task.params
        try:
            expl_raw = json.loads(expl)
        except ValueError:
            expl_raw = expl

        self._email_batcher.add_failure(
            task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, expl_raw, owners)
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            self._email_batcher.add_disable(
                task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, owners)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)
        self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)
        task.retry_policy = retry_policy
        if status != FAILED:
            task.workers.add(worker_id)
            self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
            task.runnable = runnable
```

In the corrected code, the logic for setting the task status is modified to only update the status in certain conditions, and unnecessary status updates based on worker conditions are removed.
