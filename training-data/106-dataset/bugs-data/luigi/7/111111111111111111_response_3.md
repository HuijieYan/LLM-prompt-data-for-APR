The error is occurring because when the `add_task` method is called with `status=UNKNOWN`, it is incorrectly asserting that the task with status RUNNING does not exist. This is because the `status=UNKNOWN` condition leads to new logic that does not correctly handle the situation when the task is already running.

The potential error location is within the logic that handles the `status=UNKNOWN` condition, which causes incorrect assertions when the task is already running.

The bug occurs because the `add_task` method does not properly handle the scenario where the task is already in a running state. It incorrectly assumes that a task with status `UNKNOWN` should not exist when it is actually running.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `add_task` method should be modified to handle the case where the task is already in a running state and the worker is trying to update its status to `UNKNOWN`. Instead of overriding the existing status, it should handle this situation differently.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True, 
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None, 
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None, 
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None, 
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task.status == 'RUNNING' and status == 'UNKNOWN':
        return  # do not override status if task is already running

    # remaining logic...
```

In this corrected code, a check is added to ensure that if the task is already in a running state and the worker is trying to update its status to `UNKNOWN`, the method simply returns without overriding the status. This ensures that the status is not incorrectly changed when the task is already running.
