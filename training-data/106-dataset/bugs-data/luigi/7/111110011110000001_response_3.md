The bug in the `add_task` method seems to be related to the assertion that is failing in the `test_status_wont_override` test function. The error message indicates that the `task_list` method is returning a set with the task ID 'A', but the test is expecting an empty set. This points towards a problem with the status update of the task.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the bug may have occurred due to the incorrect handling of task status update when invoking the `add_task` method with a new status. The method is not updating the status properly, leading to the incorrect result in the assertion.

To fix the bug, the code should properly handle the status update when invoking the `add_task` method with a new status. The status should be updated according to the input provided, and the related logic for managing the task status should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * Add a task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    # Update the status of the task
    task.status = status

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        # Task dependencies might not exist yet. Let's create dummy tasks for them for now.
        # Otherwise, the task dependencies might end up being pruned if scheduling takes a long time
        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    # Because some tasks (non-dynamic dependencies) are `_make_task`ed
    # before we know their retry_policy, we always set it here
    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```
