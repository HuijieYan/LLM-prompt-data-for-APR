The error occurs because the `task_list` method in the test case is expected to return a set containing the task id 'A' when the status of the task is 'RUNNING'. However, the current implementation of the `add_task` method does not update the status of the task to 'RUNNING' when it should. This results in the task not being included in the set returned by the `task_list` method, leading to the assertion error.

The bug is caused by the `add_task` method not updating the status of the task to 'RUNNING' when it should, based on the provided input parameters.

To fix the bug, the `add_task` method should ensure that the status of the task is correctly updated based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method based on the context provided:

```python
def add_task(self, worker, task_id, status='PENDING', runnable=True, deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None, assistant=False, tracking_url=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # existing code remains the same until the point where the status needs to be updated
    if tracking_url is not None or task.status != 'RUNNING':
        task.tracking_url = tracking_url
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.tracking_url = tracking_url

    if batchable is not None:
        task.batchable = batchable

    if task.remove is not None:
        task.remove = None  # unmark task for removal so it isn't removed after being added

    if expl is not None:
        task.expl = expl
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.expl = expl

    # ... (existing code remains the same)

    if status == 'RUNNING' and not task.worker_running:
        task.worker_running = worker
        if batch_id:
            task.resources_running = self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(batch_id)[0].resources_running
        task.time_running = time.time()
        
    # ... (existing code remains the same)

    # After the necessary updates, set the status of the task accordingly
    task.status = status

    # existing code after status update remains the same
```

In this corrected code, the status of the task is properly updated based on the input parameters, and this should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
