1. The test is trying to add a task with a status of "UNKNOWN" and then retrieve the task list of running tasks. It expects to get the task "A" in the list of running tasks, but it is not finding it.

2. The error is likely occurring in the add_task function, where the status is being set to "UNKNOWN."

3. The reason for the bug is that the code is not properly handling the status update and task retrieval. The handling of the status update might not be correctly updating the task's status.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the status update is correctly setting the task's status to "UNKNOWN" when adding the task.

5. Here's the corrected code for the add_task function:
```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # (previous code omitted)
    
    if task is None or (task.status != 'RUNNING' and not worker.enabled):
        return
    
    # for setting priority, we'll sometimes create tasks with unset family and params
    if not task.family:
        task.family = family
    if not getattr(task, 'module', None):
        task.module = module
    if not task.params:
        task.params = _get_default(params, {})
    
    if batch_id is not None:
        task.batch_id = batch_id
    if status == 'RUNNING' and not task.worker_running:
        task.worker_running = worker_id
        if batch_id:
            task.resources_running = self.get_batch_running_tasks(batch_id)[0].resources_running
        task.time_running = time.time()
    
    if tracking_url is not None or task.status != 'RUNNING':
        task.tracking_url = tracking_url
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.tracking_url = tracking_url
    
    if batchable is not None:
        task.batchable = batchable
    
    if task.remove is not None:
        task.remove = None  # unmark task for removal so it isn't removed after being added
    
    if expl is not None:
        task.expl = expl
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.expl = expl
    
    if not (task.status in ('RUNNING', 'BATCH_RUNNING') and status == 'PENDING') or new_deps:
        # (previous code omitted)
        pass
    # (remaining code omitted)
```
It seems like the code is setting the task's status to "RUNNING", but later on in the code, it should be using the given 'status' parameter instead. Additionally, 'RUNNING' should be defined as a string. Remember to update the variable names accordingly throughout the code.
