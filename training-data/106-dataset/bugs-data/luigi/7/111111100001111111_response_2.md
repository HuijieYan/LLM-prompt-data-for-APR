The bug seems to be occurring in the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class. The function is updating the status of the task to UNKNOWN under certain conditions, which may not be the correct behavior.

The purpose of the `add_task` method is to add a new task, update its status, and perform other related operations. However, it seems that the method may be incorrectly updating the status of the task to UNKNOWN in certain cases, which could lead to incorrect task handling and scheduling.

To fix this bug, the `add_task` method should be reviewed to ensure that the status updates are being handled correctly. The conditions under which the status is updated to UNKNOWN should be carefully analyzed to determine if it is necessary and appropriate in each case.

It's important to ensure that the status updates accurately reflect the actual state of the task and that they do not lead to incorrect scheduling decisions or conflicts between workers.

Here's the corrected `add_task` method:

```python
