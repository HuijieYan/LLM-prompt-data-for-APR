It seems that the `add_task` method is not setting the status to `UNKNOWN` when adding a task with status `UNKNOWN` for worker 'Y'. This is causing the test case to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where the status is being handled.

The bug occurred because when the task's status is set to `UNKNOWN` for worker 'Y', the status is not getting updated correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the task's status is properly updated to `UNKNOWN` when worker 'Y' adds the task with status `UNKNOWN`.

Here's the corrected version of the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):

    # existing code...

    if status != task.status or new_deps:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # existing code...

    if status == FAILED and self._config.batch_emails:
        # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if the status is different from the task's current status or if new dependencies are being added. If either condition is true, we update the task history and set the task's status accordingly. This ensures that the status is correctly updated when worker 'Y' adds the task with status `UNKNOWN`.
