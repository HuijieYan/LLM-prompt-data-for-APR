The potential error in the provided code is that the `rpc_method()` decorator is used incorrectly. The `@rpc_method()` decorator is being used with the `add_task` method but being called without specifying any actual RPC method. Additionally, there are several variables in the `add_task` method that are used without being defined.

The bug seems to be that the `add_task` method is not utilizing the `rpc_method` decorator correctly. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors when calling the `add_task` method.

To fix this bug, the `rpc_method` decorator should be used correctly. If `add_task` is intended to be an RPC method, it should be specified in the `rpc_method` decorator. Additionally, the undefined variables used within the `add_task` method should be properly defined to avoid potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.

    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected add_task method
    @rpc_method
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status="PENDING", runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
        """
        * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
        * if deps is not None, update dependency list
        * update status of task
        * add additional workers/stakeholders
        * update priority when needed
        """
        # ... existing code ...
    ...
```

In this corrected code, the `rpc_method` decorator is used correctly and the potential bug of undefined variables is not addressed as the exact variables are not mentioned in the provided code.
