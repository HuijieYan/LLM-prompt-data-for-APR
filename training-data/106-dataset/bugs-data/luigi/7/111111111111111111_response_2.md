Certainly! Here's the full code of the fixed `add_task` function:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    # Check if the task exists and its status allows an update
    task = self._state.get_task(task_id)
    if task is None or task.status not in [PENDING, RUNNING]:
        return

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected `add_task` function includes the added check for the existing status of the task before allowing any updates to be made. If the task does not exist or its status does not allow an update, the function returns without making any modifications.
