The bug occurs in the `add_task` method of the `Scheduler` class. The method updates the status of a task to `UNKNOWN` under certain conditions even though the purpose of `UNKNOWN` status is to mark a task when it is encountered as a dependency for the first time.

The bug occurs when a worker updates the status of a task to `UNKNOWN` when the scheduled tasks reach the task-limit (if the config is set), when the `complete()` of the task fails, or when the `deps()` of the task fails. This can lead to incorrect information being reflected in the central scheduler and potentially cause tasks to run multiple times at once.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to avoid updating the status of a task to `UNKNOWN` based on the mentioned conditions. Instead, it should handle these conditions differently, perhaps by logging the errors or taking appropriate actions without changing the status of the task.

Below is the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
