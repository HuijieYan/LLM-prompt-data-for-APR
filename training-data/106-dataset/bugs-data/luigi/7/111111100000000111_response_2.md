The potential error in the code is the use of the `@rpc_method()` decorator for the `add_task` method. The decorator is not implemented properly and it may be causing the method to not work as expected.

The `add_task` method is responsible for adding a new task to the scheduler, updating its status, and performing various other updates related to the task. However, due to the incomplete implementation of the decorator, the method may not be performing as intended.

To fix the bug, the decorator `@rpc_method()` should be removed, and the `add_task` method should be defined without any decorators. 

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    # the rest of the method body remains unchanged
```

Removing the `@rpc_method()` decorator should resolve the issue and the `add_task` method should work as intended.
