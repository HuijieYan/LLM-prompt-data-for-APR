The bug in the function is causing the test `test_status_wont_override` to fail. The test adds a task with 'A' to worker X, then tries to add the same task with status as UNKNOWN to worker Y. However, the test fails because the task is not being added with the status UNKNOWN as expected.

The potential error location in the code seems to be in the `add_task` method, where the status parameter is not being handled correctly.

The bug is occurring because the task's status is not being updated to UNKNOWN when the `add_task` method is called with status=UNKNOWN. This causes the task to remain in an unexpected state when later looked up in the `task_list` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the task's status is updated when `add_task` is called with a status parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method:

```python
# Corrected function
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    # rest of the function remains the same

    # Check if a status parameter is provided and update the task's status
    if status is not None:
        task.status = status

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `status` parameter passed to the method `add_task` is now being used to update the task's status. This ensures that the task's status is correctly updated as per the provided parameter value.
