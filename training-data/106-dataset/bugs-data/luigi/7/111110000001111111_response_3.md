The error occurs in the add_task method of the Scheduler class. The method updates the status of a task based on various conditions, including the worker's enabled status. However, the method doesn't handle the cases in which a worker can update the status to UNKNOWN for specific conditions.

In the given test cases, the expected values for the task status differ from the actual values, indicating that the worker's behavior in updating the task status is not aligned with the expected logic.

To fix the bug, the add_task method should be modified to handle the worker's ability to update the task status to UNKNOWN under specific conditions. This may involve revisiting the conditions under which a task can be marked as UNKNOWN and ensuring that the worker's behavior aligns with the expected scheduler logic.

Here's the corrected code for the add_task method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return

    if status == UNKNOWN:  # handling worker's ability to update status to UNKNOWN
        task.status = UNKNOWN
        self._update_task_history(task, status)  # update task history

    # remaining logic unchanged...

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

This corrected code includes a specific handling for the case where the worker updates the task status to UNKNOWN, ensuring that the scheduler's state is updated accordingly.
