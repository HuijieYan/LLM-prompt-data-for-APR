Potential error location: The function is missing a class definition before the @rpc_method decorator, which is needed for the method to be a part of a class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is missing a class definition, so when the decorator @rpc_method is used, it assumes there is a class that contains this method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Add a class definition before the @rpc_method decorator and indent the entire function to be a part of the class.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_7/luigi/scheduler.py

class Scheduler:
  
    def rpc_method(self, **request_args):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _get_default(self, x, default):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # other methods...
