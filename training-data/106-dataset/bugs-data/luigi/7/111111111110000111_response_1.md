The test case "test_status_wont_override" is attempting to add a task with status 'UNKNOWN' to the scheduler and then checking if the task with status 'RUNNING' is still present in the task list. The error message suggests that the task with status 'RUNNING' is not present in the task list, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for updating the status of the task in the "add_task" method.

The bug occurs because the logic in the "add_task" method allows a worker to update the status of a task to 'UNKNOWN'. However, this behavior can lead to incorrect status updates and inconsistencies in the scheduler's task list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "add_task" method to prevent workers from updating the status of a task to 'UNKNOWN' in most cases. Instead, the status should only be updated by the scheduler based on the actual execution and completion status of the task.

Here's the corrected code for the "add_task" method:

```python
@rpc_method
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True, deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None, assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None,
             batchable=None, batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    # Get the task from the state
    task = self._state.get_task(task_id)

    # If the task does not exist, create a new task
    if not task:
        task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=status, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params
        )
        self._state.add_task(task)

    # Perform any necessary updates based on the status and other parameters
    # ... (remaining logic for updating the task) ...

    # Finally, if the task is running and the status is set to PENDING, update the task status in the state
    if status == PENDING and task.status != RUNNING:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)

        if status == SUSPENDED:
            self._state.set_status(task, PENDING, self._config)
        else:
            self._state.set_status(task, status, self._config)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the logic that allows a worker to update the status of a task to 'UNKNOWN' and instead ensured that the status is only updated by the scheduler based on the actual task execution status. This prevents unexpected status updates and ensures consistency in the scheduler's task list.
