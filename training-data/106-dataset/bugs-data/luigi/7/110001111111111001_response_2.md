The provided test case calls the `add_task` method on two different workers ('X' and 'Y') for the same task ID ('A') with different statuses. The test then checks the status of tasks running on all workers with a status of 'RUNNING'. However, the test fails because the task ID 'A' is not found in the expected result set.

The potential error location is the conditional check `if task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled` within the `add_task` method. This check prevents the task's status from being updated when the worker is not enabled. This could lead to tasks not being correctly added or updated when workers with different statuses try to interact with the same task ID.

The bug occurs because the functionality to handle different statuses for the same task ID when accessed by different workers is not implemented correctly. It also fails to update the status of the task when there is a discrepancy between the worker's status and the current task status.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks and updates related to the task status need to be restructured within the `add_task` method. The method should consider the worker's status and update the task status accordingly, ensuring that the correct status is set for the task in all scenarios. Additionally, error handling for the scenario when workers with different statuses access the same task should be improved.

Here's the corrected `add_task` method:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    _default_task = self._make_task(
        task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
        priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
    )

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or task.status != RUNNING:
        if status != RUNNING or not worker.enabled:
            return
    
    # Update the task status based on worker and task statuses
    if status == RUNNING and (task.status != RUNNING or not task.worker_running):
        task.status = RUNNING
        task.worker_running = worker_id
        if batch_id:
            task.resources_running = self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(batch_id)[0].resources_running
        task.time_running = time.time()
    elif status != task.status:
        self._update_task_history(task, status)  # Update the task history
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    # Rest of the method remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the conditional check for updating the task status is modified to handle different scenarios based on the worker's status and the current task status. This change ensures that the task status is always updated correctly based on the worker's actions.

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected method with different worker and task status combinations to validate its functionality.
