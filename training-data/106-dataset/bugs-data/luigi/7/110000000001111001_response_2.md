The bug in the code seems to be caused by the improper handling of the `worker.enable` condition. This condition affects the initialization of the `_default_task` variable, which is used to create the `task` object. It's also used in a subsequent conditional statement, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `worker.enable` condition is properly handled, and that the `task.status` condition is correctly checked before updating the status of the task.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
             
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled and status == PENDING):
        return

    if batch_id is not None:
        task.batch_id = batch_id
    if status == RUNNING and not task.worker_running and worker.enabled:
        task.worker_running = worker_id
        if batch_id:
            task.resources_running = self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(batch_id)[0].resources_running
        task.time_running = time.time()

    if tracking_url is not None or task.status != RUNNING:
        task.tracking_url = tracking_url
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.tracking_url = tracking_url

    if batchable is not None:
        task.batchable = batchable

    if task.remove is not None:
        task.remove = None  # unmark task for removal so it isn't removed after being added

    if expl is not None:
        task.expl = expl
        if task.batch_id is not None:
            for batch_task in self._state.get_batch_running_tasks(task.batch_id):
                batch_task.expl = expl

    if not (task.status in (RUNNING, BATCH_RUNNING) and status == PENDING) or new_deps:
        # don't allow re-scheduling of task while it is running, it must either fail or succeed first
        if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
            # Update the DB only if there was an actual change, to prevent noise.
            # We also check for status == PENDING because that's the default value
            # (so checking for status != task.status would lie)
            self._update_task_history(task, status)
        self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)

    if status == FAILED and self._config.batch_emails:
        batched_params, _ = self._state.get_batcher(worker_id, family)
        if batched_params:
            unbatched_params = {
                param: value
                for param, value in six.iteritems(task.params)
                if param not in batched_params
            }
        else:
            unbatched_params = task.params
        try:
            expl_raw = json.loads(expl)
        except ValueError:
            expl_raw = expl

        self._email_batcher.add_failure(
            task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, expl_raw, owners)
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            self._email_batcher.add_disable(
                task.pretty_id, task.family, unbatched_params, owners)

    if deps is not None:
        task.deps = set(deps)

    if new_deps is not None:
        task.deps.update(new_deps)

    if resources is not None:
        task.resources = resources

    if worker.enabled and not assistant:
        task.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

        # Task dependencies might not exist yet. Let's create dummy tasks for them for now.
        # Otherwise, the task dependencies might end up being pruned if scheduling takes a long time
        for dep in task.deps or []:
            t = self._state.get_task(dep, setdefault=self._make_task(task_id=dep, status=UNKNOWN, deps=None, priority=priority))
            t.stakeholders.add(worker_id)

    self._update_priority(task, priority, worker_id)

    task.retry_policy = retry_policy

    if runnable and status != FAILED and worker.enabled:
        task.workers.add(worker_id)
        self._state.get_worker(worker_id).tasks.add(task)
        task.runnable = runnable
```

This corrected code addresses the improper conditional checks that were causing the bug and ensures that the `status`, `worker.enabled`, and other relevant conditions are handled appropriately.
