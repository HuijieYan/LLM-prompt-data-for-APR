The potential error in the code is when the task status is updated to UNKNOWN. This can happen when the scheduled tasks reach the task-limit, when the `.complete()` of the task fails, or when the `.deps()` of the task fails.

The reason behind the bug is that updating the scheduler's status to UNKNOWN in these conditions may not accurately reflect the actual state of the task. This can lead to issues such as tasks running multiple times at once, which is undesirable.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to avoid updating the scheduler's status to UNKNOWN in these conditions. Instead, the scheduler should wait for a more definitive status update from the worker.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled) or (status == UNKNOWN and not (task.status in (PENDING, RUNNING, BATCH_RUNNING))):
        return

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
