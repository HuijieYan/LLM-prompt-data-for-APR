The error in this code is likely to occur due to the misuse of the `@rpc_method` decorator in the `add_task` function. This decorator doesn't seem to be defined or imported in the code, which will lead to a syntax error. 

To fix this issue, it's recommended to remove the `@rpc_method` decorator from the `add_task` function since the purpose of this decorator is not clear based on the provided code. Alternatively, if the `@rpc_method` decorator is supposed to be used, it should be imported or defined properly in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` function without the `@rpc_method` decorator:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status='PENDING', runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
    retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)

    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status='PENDING', deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By removing the `@rpc_method` decorator, we've corrected the syntax error, and the function should now work as expected. If the decorator is indeed necessary, it should be defined/imported and used properly.
