The error is occurring because the `add_task` function is not updating the status of task 'A' to UNKNOWN when called by worker Y. This is not allowing the task to be included in the task list of running tasks.

The possible error location in the code is the following condition:
```python
if task is None or (task.status != RUNNING and not worker.enabled):
        return
```
This condition might be preventing the status from being updated to UNKNOWN.

The reason for the bug is that when worker Y calls the `add_task` function and `task` is not `None`, the function is returning without updating the task status if the task is not in RUNNING status.

To fix the bug, the `add_task` function should update the task status to UNKNOWN when called by worker Y, as expected.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@rpc_method()
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    
    # Existing code
    if worker.enabled:
        _default_task = self._make_task(
            task_id=task_id, status=PENDING, deps=deps, resources=resources,
            priority=priority, family=family, module=module, params=params,
        )
    else:
        _default_task = None

    task = self._state.get_task(task_id, setdefault=_default_task)

    if task is not None:
        # Update the status of task if it exists
        task.status = status

    # Existing code
    # ... (rest of the function)
``` 

With this correction, the `add_task` function will correctly update the status of the specified task, allowing it to be included in the running tasks list.
