The potential error in the `add_task` method is at the line `@rpc_method()`. This suggests that it is trying to use a decorator for a remote procedure call (RPC) method, but the decorator `@rpc_method()` is not defined. 

The bug occurs because the `add_task` method is trying to use a decorator `@rpc_method()`, which does not exist. The error occurs because the decorator `@rpc_method()` is not implemented in the method definition.

To fix this bug, the `@rpc_method()` decorator needs to be either implemented or removed from the `add_task` method. If the `@rpc_method()` decorator is needed for remote procedure calls, it should be implemented as a valid decorator. If it is not needed, it should be removed from the method definition.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_task` method without the `@rpc_method()` decorator:

```python
def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
             deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
             priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
             assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
             batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, **kwargs):
    """
    * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
    * if deps is not None, update dependency list
    * update status of task
    * add additional workers/stakeholders
    * update priority when needed
    """
    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```
This corrected code removes the `@rpc_method()` decorator from the method definition. If the `@rpc_method()` decorator is needed, it should be implemented as a valid decorator.
