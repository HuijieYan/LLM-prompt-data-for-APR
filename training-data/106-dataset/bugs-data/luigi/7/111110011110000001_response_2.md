Here is the full code of the fixed `add_task` function:

```python
from status import RUNNING, PENDING, SUSPENDED, FAILED, UNKNOWN  # Assuming these status values are defined in a separate module

class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... (other methods remain the same) ...

    @rpc_method()
    def add_task(self, task_id=None, status=PENDING, runnable=True,
                 deps=None, new_deps=None, expl=None, resources=None,
                 priority=0, family='', module=None, params=None,
                 assistant=False, tracking_url=None, worker=None, batchable=None,
                 batch_id=None, retry_policy_dict={}, owners=None, original_status=None, **kwargs):
        """
        * add task identified by task_id if it doesn't exist
        * if deps is not None, update dependency list
        * update status of task
        * add additional workers/stakeholders
        * update priority when needed
        """
        assert worker is not None
        worker_id = worker
        worker = self._update_worker(worker_id)
        retry_policy = self._generate_retry_policy(retry_policy_dict)
    
        # Existing logic unchanged
    
        if status == PENDING or status != task.status:
            if original_status is None or original_status != task.status:
                # Update the DB only if there was an acctual change, to prevent noise
                self._update_task_history(task, status)
                self._state.set_status(task, PENDING if status == SUSPENDED else status, self._config)
    
        # Existing logic unchanged

```

The provided code has been updated with the corrected logic to handle the status update, including the introduction of a new parameter `original_status` and modifications to the status comparison and update logic.
