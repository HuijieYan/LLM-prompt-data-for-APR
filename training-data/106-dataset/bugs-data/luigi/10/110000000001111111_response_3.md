Potential error location: The filter function is being used incorrectly, which may be causing the bug.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The filter function is not used correctly in the code. Additionally, the logic inside the if statement seems to be incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of using the filter function, a list comprehension can be used to filter the tasks based on their status.
2. It seems like the logic inside the if statement is not correct. It should be checking if the number of pending tasks is less than the total number of tasks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
