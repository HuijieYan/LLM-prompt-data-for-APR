The potential error location within the problematic function is the if-else block that is checking the length of self.tasks and calling state.num_pending_tasks().

The error occurs because the if-else block is incorrectly checking the length of self.tasks, which is a set, and trying to compare it with the result of state.num_pending_tasks(), which is not defined in the given context.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if-else block to correctly check if the task is pending or running using a for loop, and return the appropriate tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    
    return pending_tasks
```

This modified function iterates through the self.tasks set and appends tasks with status PENDING or RUNNING to a new list called pending_tasks. This list is then returned as the result.
