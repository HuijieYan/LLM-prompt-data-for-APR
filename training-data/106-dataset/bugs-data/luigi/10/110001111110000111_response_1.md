The error message indicates that the test is failing because it expects an empty set, but it is getting the set {'A'} instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else condition when comparing the length of self.tasks with state.num_pending_tasks(). This logic seems to be incorrect and causing the bug.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic inside the if-else condition does not handle the pending tasks properly and the filter lambda function is not applied correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the get_pending_tasks function to accurately filter the pending tasks based on their statuses and fix the comparison between the length of self.tasks and state.num_pending_tasks().

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            tasks.append(task)
    return tasks
```

In this corrected function, we are iterating through the self.tasks and adding tasks with status 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING' to the tasks list. After iterating through all tasks, we return the tasks list containing the pending and running tasks. This approach effectively filters the tasks based on their statuses.

This corrected function does not rely on the comparison between the length of self.tasks and state.num_pending_tasks(), and instead directly filters the tasks based on their statuses.
