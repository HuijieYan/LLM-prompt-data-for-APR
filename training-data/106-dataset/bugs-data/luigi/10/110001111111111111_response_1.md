The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` aims to verify whether the function `get_pending_tasks` correctly identifies the pending tasks for both trivial and non-trivial workers. The error message indicates that the set comparison in the test case is failing, specifically, it mentions that the second set contains items not present in the first set, with 'A' being the extra item.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic inside the `get_pending_tasks` method, which is not correctly filtering the pending and running tasks for the worker based on the current state.

The bug occurred because the `get_pending_tasks` function is not correctly filtering the tasks based on their statuses and the current state of the worker. It seems to be comparing the current number of tasks against the number of pending tasks in the state, which is not an appropriate way to filter the pending tasks for a specific worker.

To fix the bug:
1. The `get_pending_tasks` method should accept only the `self` parameter, as it should use the internal data of the class to determine the pending tasks for the worker.
2. The method should filter the tasks for the worker based on their status and the current state. It should not compare the number of tasks in the worker against the number of pending tasks in the state.
3. The corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method is as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    """
    return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
```
