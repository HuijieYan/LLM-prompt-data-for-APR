Potential Error Location: The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is trying to filter `self.tasks` based on the length of the tasks and the `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The bug occurs because the filter condition is incorrect and it is not handling the different task statuses properly. Additionally, the function `six.moves.filter` is not being used correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Utilize a for loop or list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status, rather than attempting to directly use `six.moves.filter`.
2. Properly handle the different task statuses ("PENDING" and "RUNNING") in the filter condition.
3. Return the filtered list of tasks instead of calling `state.get_pending_tasks()` which might not be the intended behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```
