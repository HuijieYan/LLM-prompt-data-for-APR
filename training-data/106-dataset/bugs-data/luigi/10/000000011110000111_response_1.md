The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` is attempting to test the `get_pending_tasks` function, but it seems that the function `get_pending_ids` is being called instead, which is not provided in the given code snippets.

The potential error in the `get_pending_tasks` function is that the `self.tasks` is being compared to `state.num_pending_tasks()`. It seems that it should be the other way around as `self.tasks` is being checked if it is less than `state.num_pending_tasks()`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison is incorrect, and the lambda function being passed to `six.moves.filter` may not be correctly filtering the tasks based on their status.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a correct comparison between the length of `self.tasks` and `state.num_pending_tasks()`, and to ensure that the lambda function passed to `filter` correctly filters the tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    if len(self.tasks) > state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
