The potential error in the provided function is in the condition `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():`. The function is trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. Incorrect comparison: The condition `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`, which is not a meaningful comparison. It seems like the intention might have been to check if the number of pending tasks in `state` is greater than the number of tasks in `self.tasks`, but the current implementation does not achieve that.

2. Incorrect use of `self.tasks`: The buggy function uses `self.tasks` without declaring it as an instance variable. This might cause an error if `self.tasks` is not defined in the class where the function is defined.

To fix the bug, the comparison needs to be changed to compare the number of pending tasks directly, and the usage of `self.tasks` should be properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    if state.num_pending_tasks() > len(self.tasks):
        return {task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]}
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code:
1. The comparison is changed to check if the number of pending tasks in `state` is greater than the number of tasks in `self.tasks`.
2. The method `six.moves.filter` is replaced with a set comprehension to filter tasks based on their status.
