The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` is trying to check for pending tasks for the workers in the scheduler. It adds tasks with different statuses (PENDING and DONE) and then checks for pending tasks for each worker. The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual({'B'}, self.get_pending_ids(trivial_worker, scheduler_state))` is failing because the result includes task 'A' which is not expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic inside the `get_pending_tasks` method of the `Worker` class. The `get_pending_tasks` method should filter out the tasks with status 'DONE' and return only the tasks with status 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING' for the given worker. However, the current implementation is not filtering out the 'DONE' tasks properly, leading to incorrect results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_pending_tasks` method is not correctly filtering out the 'DONE' tasks, and the logic for comparing the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks is flawed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the `get_pending_tasks` method to properly filter out the 'DONE' tasks and accurately determine the pending tasks for the worker.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    return pending_tasks
```

With this corrected code, the `get_pending_tasks` method will properly filter out the 'DONE' tasks and return only the pending (and running) tasks for the given worker. This should fix the bug and ensure that the test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` runs successfully.
