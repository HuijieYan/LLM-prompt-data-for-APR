The error occurs in the test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` where it is expected that for the non-trivial worker, the pending id should be `{'A'}` but the actual returned value is `{'B'}`.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement:
```python
if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
```
The issue is that the comparison is being done between the length of `self.tasks` (which is an array/set of tasks) and the result from `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison is not correctly checking the actual pending or running tasks for a specific worker and is erroneously returning the results.

One approach for fixing the bug is to directly compare the number of pending or running tasks for the specific worker. The corrected code for the problematic function `get_pending_tasks` is as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    
    if len(pending_running_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self)
```

By directly counting the pending/running tasks for the specific worker and comparing it with the result from `state.num_pending_tasks()`, the bug is fixed.
