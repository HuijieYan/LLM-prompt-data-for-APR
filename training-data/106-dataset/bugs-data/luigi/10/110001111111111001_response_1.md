Potential error location: The error seems to be in the `get_pending_tasks` function. This function is supposed to return pending and running tasks for the worker based on the state provided. It is likely that the logic in the function is not correctly identifying the pending tasks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is not using the state parameter to check for pending tasks. Instead, it is using the length of tasks and calling the `num_pending_tasks` method from the state, which is not consistent with the function signature.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. The function should use the state parameter to get pending tasks for the worker.
2. It can check for pending tasks and running tasks based on the status in the state.
3. It should return the tasks that are pending or running for the worker using the state information.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
        """
        Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

        You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
        """
        pending_tasks = []
        for task in self.tasks:
            if state.get_task_status(task) in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
                pending_tasks.append(task)
        return pending_tasks
```

In the corrected code:
- We iterate through the tasks of the worker and check their status using `state.get_task_status(task)`.
- If the status is 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING', we add the task to the `pending_tasks` list.
- Finally, we return the list of pending tasks based on their status in the state.
