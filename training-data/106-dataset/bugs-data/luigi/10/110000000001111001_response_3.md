The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is designed to return PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for a worker based on the input state. However, it has multiple issues such as using `len()` on a set, using an undefined variable `PENDING`, and erroneous use of `six.moves.filter()`.

The potential error location is the use of `len()` to check the size of the set `self.tasks` and the use of an undefined variable `PENDING` in the `filter` function.

The bug occurs because:
1. `len()` function is used to get the size of a set, which is not allowed in Python. It should use `len(self.tasks)` instead.
2. The variable `PENDING` is not defined in the function, it should be defined as a string `PENDING = "PENDING"`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change `len(self.tasks)` where calculation of the length of a set is utilized.
2. Define `PENDING` as a string with value `"PENDING"`.
3. Replace `six.moves.filter()` with a list comprehension or `filter()` function.

The corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function is provided below.

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = "PENDING"
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, "RUNNING"]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
