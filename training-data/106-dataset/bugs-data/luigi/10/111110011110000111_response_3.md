The error message indicates that the `get_pending_ids` function is returning incorrect results. The issue is likely within the `get_pending_tasks` function defined in the `Worker` class.

In the `get_pending_tasks` function, the bug occurs because the `filter` method is not being applied correctly. The lambda function inside `filter` does not return the expected result.

To fix this bug, you can replace the `get_pending_tasks` function with the following corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

The corrected function uses list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status and stores the result in the variable `pending_running_tasks`. The condition for `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` then checks whether to return all the pending and running tasks or to delegate to `state.get_pending_tasks()`.
