The potential error in the `get_pending_tasks` method lies in the conditional statement that checks the length of `self.tasks` against the number of pending tasks in the `state` object. If the length of `self.tasks` is less than the number of pending tasks in the `state`, the method attempts to filter the tasks based on their status. However, if the length of `self.tasks` is greater, the method tries to retrieve the pending tasks from the `state` without passing any arguments.

The error occurs because the method `num_pending_tasks` is called with `self` and `state` as arguments, but it is defined to accept only `self`. Additionally, the lambda function for filtering the tasks based on their status is not applied correctly.

To fix the bug, the `num_pending_tasks` method should not accept any arguments, and the lambda function should be used to filter the tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In this corrected code, the `num_pending_tasks` method is not modified because it should not accept any arguments. The `filter` function is used to correctly filter the tasks based on their status, and the result is converted to a list for returning.
