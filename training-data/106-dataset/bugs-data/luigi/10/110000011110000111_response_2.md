The test case 'test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks' is checking the behavior of the 'get_pending_tasks' method with tasks having different statuses. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing because the expected set is {'B'}, but the actual set contains 'A' as well.

The potential error location within the 'get_pending_tasks' function is the filtering logic inside the if statement. The lambda function passed to 'six.moves.filter' does not correctly filter the tasks based on their status.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the lambda function inside the filter is not implemented correctly to filter out the PENDING and RUNNING tasks. Additionally, the else block has a call to 'state.get_pending_tasks()', but there is no reference to such a method in the provided code.

To fix the bug, the lambda function should be modified to correctly filter the tasks based on their status. Additionally, the else block should be updated to return the pending tasks from the current worker's state.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status == 'PENDING']
```

By modifying the filtering logic using list comprehension and returning the pending tasks based on their status, the function is corrected.
