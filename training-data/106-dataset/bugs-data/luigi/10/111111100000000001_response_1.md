Potential error location: The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is trying to call the method `num_pending_tasks` on the `state` object, but it's not defined in the provided code.

Reason for the bug: The method `num_pending_tasks` is not defined in the provided code, so when it's called in the `get_pending_tasks` function, it will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the `num_pending_tasks` method in the `state` class or use an existing method that serves the same purpose.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
