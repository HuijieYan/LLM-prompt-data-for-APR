The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect usage of the `filter` function. In the current implementation, the `filter` function is not being used correctly.

The suggested fix for the bug is to use list comprehensions to filter and return the tasks based on their status.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
