The potential error location within the problematic function is as follows:

```python
if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
    return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks)
else:
    return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

The reason behind the bug is that the original function is trying to compare the length of self.tasks with the result of state.num_pending_tasks(), which seems to be incorrect. Additionally, it is unclear what self.tasks represents and how it is related to the state parameter.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic to accurately compare the pending tasks based on the state parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    
    return pending_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we loop through each task in self.tasks, check if the status is 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING', and then add the task to the pending_tasks list. Finally, we return the list of pending tasks. This approach removes the unnecessary comparison with state.num_pending_tasks() and provides a clearer logic for obtaining the pending tasks.
