The original function `get_pending_tasks` is defined twice in the `Worker` class. This will create an ambiguous reference to the function, and it is causing a bug. The error message is not provided, but based on the code, the issue seems to be related to the ambiguity in function definition.

The bug occurs because the `get_pending_tasks` function is defined twice with different signatures. This results in ambiguity when calling the function, as the interpreter cannot determine which version of the function to use.

To fix the bug, the redundant definition of `get_pending_tasks` should be removed, and the correct signature should be used.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks)
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
