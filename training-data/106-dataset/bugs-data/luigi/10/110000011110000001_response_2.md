Potential error location:
The `get_pending_tasks` function is not actually using the `state` parameter that is passed as an argument, and is instead using the `self` object to determine the number of tasks.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not using the `state` parameter as intended, and is not properly filtering the tasks based on the status.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `state` parameter to get the number of pending tasks and correctly filter the tasks based on their status.
2. Update the function to check the status of each task and return only the PENDING or RUNNING tasks.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_tasks
```
