The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect usage of the `self.tasks` and `state` variables. The function is trying to check the length of `self.tasks` and then call the `num_pending_tasks` method on the `state` object. Additionally, the lambda function used with `six.moves.filter` might not be appropriate as it filters elements based on a condition.

The potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
- Incorrect use of the `self.tasks` variable in the comparison.
- Improper handling of the `state` object and its method call.

To fix the bug, the corrected function can be as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return set(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code:
- Removed the `six.moves.filter` and used the built-in `filter` function to filter the tasks based on the status condition.
- Used the `state.num_pending_tasks()` directly in the comparison to get the number of pending tasks.

By making these changes, the function should work properly and return the expected output.
