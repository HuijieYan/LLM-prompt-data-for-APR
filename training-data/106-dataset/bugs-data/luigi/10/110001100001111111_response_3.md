Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the comparison `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():`. It seems that `self.tasks` is being treated as an array while `state.num_pending_tasks()` is being treated as a function, which might not be the correct comparison.

Reason for the bug: The comparison `if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():` is comparing the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`, which seems incorrect. Additionally, the usage of `six.moves.filter` doesn't seem appropriate with the given context.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Access the `state` to get the pending tasks directly instead of comparing the length of `self.tasks` with `state.num_pending_tasks()`.
2. Use a traditional loop to filter the pending and running tasks based on their status.
3. Use a list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status.

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    return pending_tasks
```
This corrected code directly filters the `self.tasks` based on the status of the tasks and returns the pending (and running) tasks.
