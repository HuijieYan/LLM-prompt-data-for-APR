The bug in the `get_pending_tasks` function is that it is not handling the state properly and the conditional statement seems to be incorrect. It is comparing the length of `self.tasks` to the number of pending tasks in the state, and if `self.tasks` is less than `state.num_pending_tasks()`, it returns a filtered list of tasks. Otherwise, it returns `state.get_pending_tasks()`.

The issue with the original function is that `self.tasks` is being compared to the number of pending tasks in the state. However, `self.tasks` is a set of tasks whereas `state.num_pending_tasks()` returns the number of pending tasks. This comparison does not seem meaningful.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use `len(self.tasks)` to get the number of tasks for the worker, and then compare it to a combination of pending and running tasks in the state. Additionally, instead of returning `state.get_pending_tasks()`, the function could simply return the filtered tasks from `self.tasks` based on the status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_running_tasks.append(task)
    return pending_running_tasks
```

With this correction, the function properly filters the tasks based on their status and returns the list of pending and running tasks for the worker.
