The error message in the test function indicates that there is an issue with the `get_pending_ids` function, which is a part of the buggy `get_pending_tasks` function.

The potential error location within the `get_pending_tasks` function is the usage of the `six.moves.filter` method. It seems that the lambda function inside the filter is not correctly handling the task status comparison.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug may be due to incorrect usage of the lambda function in the `six.moves.filter` method. It is not properly filtering the tasks based on their status.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to use a list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status, instead of using the `six.moves.filter` method. Another approach could be to explicitly check the status of each task and then filter out the pending and running tasks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
from luigi.scheduler import PENDING, RUNNING

def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code, the `six.moves.filter` method is replaced with a list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status. This should resolve the issue and the test function should pass without any errors.
