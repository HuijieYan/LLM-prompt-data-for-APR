The error occurs in the test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks`. The test is failing with an AssertionError because it is expecting `{'B'}` to be the pending tasks for the trivial_worker, but it's getting `{'A'}` instead. This suggests that the `get_pending_tasks` method is not working correctly.

The potential error location is within the `get_pending_tasks` function. It seems to be incorrectly using the `len(self.tasks)` as a condition to check the number of pending tasks. Additionally, the use of `six.moves.filter` and the comparison of `task.status` with `[PENDING, RUNNING]` is suspicious.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are likely due to:
1. Incorrect usage of `len(self.tasks)` to determine the number of pending tasks.
2. Incorrect usage of `six.moves.filter` and the comparison of `task.status` with `[PENDING, RUNNING]`.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method is provided below:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task)
    return pending_tasks
```

The changes made in the corrected code are:
1. Removed the comparison of the length of `self.tasks` with `state.num_pending_tasks()` as it was not suitable for determining the number of pending tasks.
2. Replaced the usage of `six.moves.filter` with a for loop to iterate over `self.tasks` and check the status of each task.
3. Changed the comparison of `task.status` so that it checks if the task status is either 'PENDING' or 'RUNNING', using the correct syntax for lists ('[]' instead of '()').
