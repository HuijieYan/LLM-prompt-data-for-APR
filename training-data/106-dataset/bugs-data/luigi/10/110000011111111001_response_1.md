The `get_pending_tasks` function is supposed to return the pending and running tasks for a worker. However, there are several issues in the provided function:

1. The function is using an undefined variable `PENDING` without importing it or defining it.
2. The `six.moves.filter` function is not being called properly. It should take two arguments, a function and an iterable, but the function is not being called correctly.
3. The function is returning different types of values based on conditions, which can cause issues in the calling code.

To fix the function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Import the `PENDING` status from the required module or define it if it's a custom value.
2. Change the `six.moves.filter` to the built-in `filter` function to filter the pending and running tasks from the input `self.tasks`.
3. Make sure to always return the same type of value, such as a list or a set, for consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = 'PENDING'  # Assuming this is the status to be used
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, 'RUNNING']]
    return pending_tasks
```
