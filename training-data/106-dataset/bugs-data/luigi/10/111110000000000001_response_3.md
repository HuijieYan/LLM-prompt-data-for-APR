Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the use of `six.moves.filter` and the comparison `task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]`.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. `six.moves.filter` is used incorrectly. It should be used to filter elements from an iterable, but the lambda function is not applied to any iterable in this context.
2. The comparison `task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]` might throw an error because the variables PENDING and RUNNING have not been defined anywhere in the given code.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct syntax for the `filter` function to filter tasks based on their status.
2. Define the PENDING and RUNNING variables if they are supposed to be used as constants.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    PENDING = 'PENDING'  # Define PENDING if not already defined
    RUNNING = 'RUNNING'  # Define RUNNING if not already defined
    
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
