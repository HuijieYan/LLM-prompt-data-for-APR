The error in the code is that the function `get_pending_tasks` is defined twice in the `Worker` class. This will cause the second definition to overwrite the first one, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the `get_pending_tasks` function is defined twice in the `Worker` class. The second definition overwrites the first one, so the original implementation of the function is lost.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the second definition of the `get_pending_tasks` function and keep only the correct implementation of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
