The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `get_pending_ids` method inside the `SchedulerWorkerTest` class. The error occurs at line 241 of the `scheduler_test.py` file. This suggests that the issue might be related to the incorrect implementation of the `get_pending_ids` method.

Looking at the code and the error message, it seems that the `get_pending_ids` method is not correctly implemented to retrieve the pending task IDs for a worker. This could be due to the buggy implementation of the `get_pending_tasks` method inside the `Worker` class, which is being called by the `get_pending_ids` method.

The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` inside the `Worker` class seems to have issues related to checking for pending or running tasks and returning the correct result. The lambda function used in the buggy implementation might not be correctly filtering the tasks based on their status.

To fix this issue, the `get_pending_tasks` function can be corrected as follows:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_running_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    if len(pending_running_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_running_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code:
- The list comprehension is used to filter the tasks based on their status.
- Return the filtered tasks directly if their count is less than the number of pending tasks in the state.
- Otherwise, return the pending tasks from the state.

This should fix the issue and ensure that the `get_pending_ids` method in the test case can retrieve the correct pending task IDs for a worker.
