Potential error location: The error seems to be in the `get_pending_tasks` function where it is trying to compare the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The function `num_pending_tasks(self)` is not being used properly in the `get_pending_tasks` function. 
2. The comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` does not seem to make sense in the context of the function. 
3. The use of `six.moves.filter` also seems inappropriate in this context as it is not being used with an iterable.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` and the corresponding `else` block.
2. Use the `state.num_pending_tasks()` function directly to get the pending tasks.
3. Use a proper method of filtering the tasks based on their status.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_10/luigi/scheduler.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
```
