The bug occurs because the function get_pending_tasks() is defined twice within the Worker class in the luigi.scheduler module. One definition takes an additional 'state' parameter, which is not present in the other definition. This is causing a conflict and ambiguity when calling the function with different parameters.

To fix the bug:
- Remove the definition of get_pending_tasks() that takes the 'state' parameter.
- Update the remaining get_pending_tasks() function to accept only the 'self' parameter, as it already internally accesses the state.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Remove this definition as it's causing conflict
    # def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    #     # ... omitted code ...
    #     pass

    # Corrected definition of get_pending_tasks
    def get_pending_tasks(self):
        """
        Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

        You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
        """
        if len(self.tasks) < self.state.num_pending_tasks():
            return six.moves.filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING],
                                    self.tasks)
        else:
            return self.state.get_pending_tasks()
