The problematic function `get_pending_tasks` is expecting a `state` parameter and it looks like it's trying to filter tasks based on their status. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The function is not using the `state` parameter at all in the logic.
2. The use of `six.moves.filter` is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be using the `filter` function directly.
3. When `len(self.tasks)` is less than `state.num_pending_tasks()`, it tries to filter tasks based on their status, but the logic is incorrect.

To fix the issues, we should rewrite the function to properly use the `state` parameter to get the pending tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        pending_tasks = filter(lambda task: task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING'], self.tasks)
        return list(pending_tasks)  # Convert the filtered tasks back to a list
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should properly filter the pending and running tasks based on the `state` and return the correct result.
