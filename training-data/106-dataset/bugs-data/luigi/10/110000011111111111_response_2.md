Potential error location: The problematic code is in the `get_pending_tasks` function. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. It compares the length of `self.tasks` with the number of pending tasks, which may not always give the correct comparison.
2. It attempts to filter tasks based on their status, but the filtering logic is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct method to get the count of pending tasks from the state object.
2. Use a proper filter function to filter the tasks based on their status.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from luigi.task import PENDING, RUNNING

def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    num_pending = state.num_pending_tasks(self.id)

    if len(self.tasks) < num_pending:
        return {task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]}
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self.id)
```
