Potential error location:
The error is occurring at the line `self.assertEqual({'B'}, self.get_pending_ids(trivial_worker, scheduler_state))` in the test case. The function `get_pending_ids` is not defined, so it seems like there is a typo and it should be calling the `get_pending_tasks` function instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the function `get_pending_tasks` is not returning the expected set of pending task IDs. The function is also not using the passed `state` variable, which suggests that there might be confusion between different versions of `get_pending_tasks` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the original `get_pending_tasks` function that takes a `state` argument to something else, to avoid confusion with the other functions.
2. Modify the function to properly use the `state` variable for getting pending tasks.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING tasks for this worker using the provided state.
    """
    return {task.id for task in self.tasks if task.status == PENDING}
```
