The test case `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` is checking for the pending tasks for both trivial and non-trivial workers. It is expected that the pending tasks for the trivial worker will only include task 'B', and for the non-trivial worker will only include task 'A'. However, the test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the actual pending tasks for the trivial worker also include task 'A', which is incorrect.

The potential error in the code is the implementation of the `get_pending_tasks` function within the `Worker` class. It is not correctly filtering the pending and running tasks for the given worker. The function should filter the tasks based on the worker and the state.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly returning tasks from the state without considering the worker's tasks. It should filter the worker's tasks and return only the pending or running tasks for that worker.

To fix the bug, the `get_pending_tasks` function should be modified to correctly filter the pending and running tasks for the given worker.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    worker_tasks = [task for task in state.get_worker_tasks(self.id)]
    pending_tasks = [task for task in worker_tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    return pending_tasks
```

This corrected function will filter the tasks based on the worker's id and return only the pending or running tasks. It should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
