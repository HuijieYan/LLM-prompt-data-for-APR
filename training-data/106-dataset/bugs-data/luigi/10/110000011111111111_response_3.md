The error message indicates that the `get_pending_ids` method is returning the wrong set of pending task ids. This indicates that the `get_pending_tasks` method itself is not returning the correct pending tasks.

Potential location of the bug: The bug is likely within the `get_pending_tasks` method, specifically within the conditional statement that checks the length of `self.tasks` compared to `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparison logic and returning the wrong values based on the condition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of using the length of `self.tasks` to determine the number of pending tasks, consider using the `state.num_pending_tasks()` directly to get the correct count.
2. After getting the correct count of pending tasks, filter the tasks based on their status and return the appropriate set of pending tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    
    pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    
    if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return pending_tasks
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

This corrected code directly filters the tasks based on their status and returns the correct set of pending tasks.
