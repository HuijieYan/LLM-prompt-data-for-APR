The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` in the `Worker` class is intended to return PENDING and RUNNING tasks for a worker based on the input `state`. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. In the `if` condition, the comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` compares the length of `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`. This seems to be incorrect as it should compare the number of tasks in `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()`. This likely leads to unexpected behavior.

2. In the `if` block, the code is attempting to filter tasks based on their status, but it is using `six.moves.filter` incorrectly. This method is used to create an iterator in a backward compatible manner, but it should be called with the function to apply to each element and the iterable to apply it to.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return {task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']}
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code:
- We use a set comprehension to filter tasks based on their status and return the set of PENDING and RUNNING tasks.
- We also properly compare the number of tasks in `self.tasks` with the result of `state.num_pending_tasks()` to decide whether to return the worker's tasks or to delegate to the state.

This should address the issues with the original implementation and make the function work as intended.
