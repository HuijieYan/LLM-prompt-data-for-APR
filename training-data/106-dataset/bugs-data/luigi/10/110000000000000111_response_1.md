Potential Error Location: 
The bug seems to be in the conditional statement. The function is supposed to return PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks if the number of tasks is less than the number of pending tasks in the state, otherwise it should return pending tasks from the state.

Reason for the Bug:
The conditional statement is checking if the number of tasks is less than the number of pending tasks in the state, but the comparison should be the opposite way. 

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Change the comparison operator in the conditional statement from '<' to '>='.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) >= state.num_pending_tasks():
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
    else:
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
```
