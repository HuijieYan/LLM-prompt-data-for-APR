The issue with the `get_pending_tasks` function is that it is using the `len` function on `self.tasks`, which is of type `set`. Sets do not have a `len` method, so this code will raise an error. Additionally, the function is attempting to use a `lambda` and `six.moves.filter` for filtering tasks, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.

To fix the bug, we can convert the set `self.tasks` to a list and then use list comprehension to filter the tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(list(self.tasks)) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

This code converts the `self.tasks` set to a list and then filters the tasks based on their status using list comprehension. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected for the provided test cases.
