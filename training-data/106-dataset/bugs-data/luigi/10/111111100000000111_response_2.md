Potential error location: The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` is trying to access the function `num_pending_tasks` on the `state` object, but it should be accessing the function `num_pending_tasks` from the `Worker` class instead.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is trying to access the `num_pending_tasks` function from the `state` object, but it should actually be accessing this function from the `Worker` class. This results in an AttributeError because `state` does not have a `num_pending_tasks` function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the line `state.num_pending_tasks()` to `self.num_pending_tasks()` to access the `num_pending_tasks` function from the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < self.num_pending_tasks():
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING],
                           self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
