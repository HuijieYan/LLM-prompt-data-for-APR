The error message is indicating that the test is failing because the function is returning 'A' instead of 'B' as the pending task for the 'TRIVIAL' worker. This suggests that the function is not properly filtering out the 'DONE' tasks and returning only the 'PENDING' tasks.

The potential error location within the `get_pending_tasks` function is the `if` statement that is supposed to filter out the 'DONE' tasks. It seems that the condition is incorrect or not working as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition in the `if` statement is not correctly filtering out the 'DONE' tasks.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `if` statement to filter out the 'DONE' tasks and return only the 'PENDING' tasks for the worker.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

In the corrected code, the lambda function has been replaced with a list comprehension to properly filter out the 'DONE' tasks and return only the 'PENDING' and 'RUNNING' tasks for the worker.
