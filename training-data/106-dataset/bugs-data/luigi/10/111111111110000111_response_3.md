The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected set {'B'} does not match the actual set {'A'}. This suggests that the get_pending_ids function is not returning the expected result.

The potential error location within the problematic function is with the comparison of pending task IDs.

The bug occurred because the get_pending_ids function is not correctly filtering the pending tasks based on their status.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the get_pending_tasks function to correctly filter the pending tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the get_pending_tasks function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = []
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.append(task)

    return pending_tasks
```

This code uses a for loop to iterate through the tasks and filters the pending tasks based on their status, appending them to a new list called pending_tasks. This list is then returned as the result of the function.
