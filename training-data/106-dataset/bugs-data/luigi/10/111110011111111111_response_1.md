The error message indicates that the `get_pending_ids` method is not returning the expected result. This method is likely being used to retrieve the pending task ids from the worker, and the `get_pending_tasks` method is being called to perform this task.

The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` has a couple of issues:
1. The comparison `len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks()` does not seem to be a correct way to determine if the number of tasks is less than the number of pending tasks.
2. The use of `six.moves.filter` in the return statement is incorrect and not achieving the intended behavior.

To fix the function, we can make the following changes:
- Use `len(self.tasks)` directly to compare the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks.
- Use a list comprehension for filtering tasks based on their status.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < len(state.get_pending_tasks()):
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly return the pending (and running) tasks for the worker when called with the appropriate `state` object.
