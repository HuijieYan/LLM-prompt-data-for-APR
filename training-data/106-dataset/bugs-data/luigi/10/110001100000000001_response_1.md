Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is that the function `num_pending_tasks` is called as an instance method using the `state` object, which may not be correct.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `num_pending_tasks` is being called as a method of the `state` object, which is not defined within the provided context. This is causing the code to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `num_pending_tasks` is intended to be a method of the `state` object, then the `state` object should be passed as an argument to the function, and the `num_pending_tasks` method should be appropriately defined within the `state` class.
2. If `num_pending_tasks` is intended to be a method of the same class as the `get_pending_tasks` function, then it should be called using `self.num_pending_tasks()` rather than `state.num_pending_tasks()`.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < self.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING]]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
