The error message states that there is an assertion error. The test is checking for the equality of two sets, where the actual result should be `{'B'}` for the trivial worker, but it returns `'A'` instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `self.get_pending_ids()` method, which is not defined or implemented in the provided code.

The bug occurs because the `self.get_pending_ids()` method is being used without being implemented. This results in the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `self.get_pending_ids()` method should be implemented in the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

Additionally, the `get_pending_ids` method should be implemented in the `SchedulerWorkerTest` class to correctly evaluate the test cases. Without visibility into the implementation of the `Scheduler` and other relevant classes, it's not possible to provide the exact implementation for `get_pending_ids`.
