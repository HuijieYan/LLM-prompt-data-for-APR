The buggy function `get_pending_tasks` contains multiple function definitions with the same name but different parameters. This is not allowed in Python and causes an error. Additionally, the logic of the function seems incorrect as well. It is trying to filter tasks based on the length of `self.tasks` and the number of pending tasks in the `state`.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Remove the duplicate function definitions for `get_pending_tasks`.
2. Update the logic of the `get_pending_tasks` function to correctly filter tasks based on their status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state=None):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if state:
        pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
        if len(pending_tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
            return pending_tasks
        else:
            return state.get_pending_tasks()
    else:
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
```

In this corrected code:
1. The function `get_pending_tasks` now takes an optional parameter `state`, which can be passed in for optimization reasons, but is not mandatory.
2. The function filters the tasks based on their status and returns the appropriate list of pending tasks. If the `state` is provided and the number of pending tasks exceeds a certain length, it proceeds to fetch pending tasks from the `state`.
3. The function now only has one definition with the correct parameters, fixing the duplicate function definitions issue.
