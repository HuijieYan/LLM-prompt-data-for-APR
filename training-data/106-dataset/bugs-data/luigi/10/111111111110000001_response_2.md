1. The test case is checking the pending tasks for workers 'TRIVIAL' and 'NON_TRIVIAL' by adding tasks with different statuses (PENDING and DONE) and then checking the pending task IDs using the `get_pending_ids` function.

2. The potential error location is the `get_pending_tasks` function in the `Worker` class.

3. The bug is occurring because the `get_pending_tasks` function is calling `state.get_pending_tasks()` unconditionally if the length of `self.tasks` is not less than the number of pending tasks. This is causing the test case to fail because it is expecting a specific set of pending tasks for the trivial and non-trivial workers.

4. To fix the bug, we can check the length of `self.tasks` and apply the logic accordingly. Additionally, we need to filter tasks based on their status (PENDING and RUNNING) within the `get_pending_tasks` function.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
        """
        Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
        
        You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
        """
        if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
            return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
        else:
            return state.get_pending_tasks(self)
```
