The bug in the given code is that the `get_pending_tasks` method is defined twice in the `Worker` class, once with an additional `state` parameter and once without. Python does not allow method overloading, so the second definition of `get_pending_tasks` with no parameters overrides the first one, creating a conflict.

To fix this bug, the second definition of `get_pending_tasks` should be removed, and the first one should be modified to handle both cases of having or not having a `state` parameter.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = set()

    def get_pending_tasks(self, state=None):
        """
        Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

        If state is provided, use it for optimization reasons. If not, use self's state.
        """
        if state:
            num_tasks = state.num_pending_tasks()
            pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
        else:
            num_tasks = self.num_pending_tasks()
            pending_tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]

        if len(self.tasks) < num_tasks:
            return pending_tasks
        else:
            if state:
                return state.get_pending_tasks()
            else:
                return self.get_pending_tasks()
```
