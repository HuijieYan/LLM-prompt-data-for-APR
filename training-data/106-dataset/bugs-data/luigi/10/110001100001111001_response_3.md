The error in the provided function is due to an attempt to access the member function `num_pending_tasks()` from the object `state`, which is of type `SimpleTaskState`. However, the `state` object does not have a member function `num_pending_tasks()`, hence causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'get_pending_tasks' function to directly access the `num_pending_tasks()` function from the `state` object. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
``` 

This corrected code directly accesses the `num_pending_tasks()` function from the `state` object when comparing the length of `self.tasks`. It also correctly filters the tasks by checking their status as 'PENDING' and 'RUNNING' using list comprehension.
