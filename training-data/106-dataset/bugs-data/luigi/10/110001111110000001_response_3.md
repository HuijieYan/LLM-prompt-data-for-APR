The test function `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` creates a Scheduler instance and adds tasks to it. It then tries to retrieve the pending tasks for different workers and compares the result with the expected set of pending task ids.

The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual({'B'}, self.get_pending_ids(trivial_worker, scheduler_state))` failed, with the difference being that `'A'` was expected to be in the set of pending tasks for the `NON_TRIVIAL` worker, but it was not found.

The issue seems to be related to the `get_pending_ids` function not returning the expected set of pending task ids for a given worker and scheduler state.

The problematic function `get_pending_tasks` appears to have a bug in the conditional statement and also incorrectly implemented the use of the provided `state` parameter.

The bug occurs because the function checks the length of the worker's tasks against the number of pending tasks in the state; however, it should instead be checking the number of pending tasks of the worker in the state. Additionally, the lambda function used with `six.moves.filter` is also incorrect and should be modified.

To fix the bug, the following corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` function can be used:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.
    
    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if state.num_pending_tasks(self) < len(self.tasks):
        return [task.id for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks(self)
```

This corrected code ensures that the correct number of pending tasks for the worker is checked against the length of the worker's tasks. It also correctly filters the tasks based on their status and returns the list of task ids of pending or running tasks.
