Potential error location:
The issue lies in the `get_pending_tasks` method. It is not returning the expected pending tasks. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `get_pending_tasks` method is not correctly filtering the tasks based on their status. It also does not use the provided state for optimization.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The function should compare the number of tasks with the number of pending tasks in the state and return the appropriate tasks based on their status.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']]
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```
