# Corrected function source code
```python
# corrected function
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    if len(self.tasks) < state.num_pending_tasks():
        return list(filter(lambda task: task.status in [PENDING, RUNNING], self.tasks))
    else:
        return state.get_pending_tasks()
```

Explanation:
The original code has a few issues:
1. The `six.moves.filter` function is used, which is not the correct way to filter a list in Python.
2. The lambda function used in the filter is not returning any value.

To fix the issues, the code should use the built-in `filter` function in Python, and the lambda function should explicitly return the filtered tasks. Additionally, the corrected code includes converting the filtered result to a list using the `list` function.

The corrected code addresses these issues and provides the expected behavior for the `get_pending_tasks` function.
