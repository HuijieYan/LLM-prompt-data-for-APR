The `test_get_pending_tasks_with_many_done_tasks` method is testing the `get_pending_ids` method by adding tasks to the scheduler and then checking the pending ids for trivial and non-trivial workers.

The error message indicates that there is an assertion error, specifically that 'A' is present in the second set but not the first. This means that the pending ids for the non-trivial worker are not being correctly identified.

The issue is likely in the `get_pending_tasks` method in the `Worker` class. The conditional statement within the method is incorrectly comparing the length of tasks with the number of pending tasks in the state. Additionally, the lambda function and filter are incorrect and not ideal for achieving the desired result.

To fix the bug, you will need to modify the conditional statement and the logic within the `get_pending_tasks` method to correctly identify the pending tasks for the worker.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_pending_tasks` method:

```python
def get_pending_tasks(self, state):
    """
    Get PENDING (and RUNNING) tasks for this worker.

    You have to pass in the state for optimization reasons.
    """
    pending_tasks = set()
    for task in self.tasks:
        if task.status in ['PENDING', 'RUNNING']:
            pending_tasks.add(task.id)
    
    return pending_tasks
```

This corrected method iterates through the tasks of the worker and adds the ids of pending and running tasks to the `pending_tasks` set. It then returns the set of pending tasks.
