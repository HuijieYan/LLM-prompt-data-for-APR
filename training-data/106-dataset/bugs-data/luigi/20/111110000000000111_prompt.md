Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
@six.add_metaclass(Register)
class Task(object):
    """
    This is the base class of all Luigi Tasks, the base unit of work in Luigi.
    
    A Luigi Task describes a unit or work.
    
    The key methods of a Task, which must be implemented in a subclass are:
    
    * :py:meth:`run` - the computation done by this task.
    * :py:meth:`requires` - the list of Tasks that this Task depends on.
    * :py:meth:`output` - the output :py:class:`Target` that this Task creates.
    
    Parameters to the Task should be declared as members of the class, e.g.::
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        class MyTask(luigi.Task):
            count = luigi.IntParameter()
    
    
    Each Task exposes a constructor accepting all :py:class:`Parameter` (and
    values) as kwargs. e.g. ``MyTask(count=10)`` would instantiate `MyTask`.
    
    In addition to any declared properties and methods, there are a few
    non-declared properties, which are created by the :py:class:`Register`
    metaclass:
    
    ``Task.task_namespace``
      optional string which is prepended to the task name for the sake of
      scheduling. If it isn't overridden in a Task, whatever was last declared
      using `luigi.namespace` will be used.
    
    ``Task._parameters``
      list of ``(parameter_name, parameter)`` tuples for this task class
    """

    def get_params(cls):
        # ... omitted code ...

    def to_str_params(self):

        for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
            if params[param_name].significant:
                params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Fix task_to_str_to_task behaviour when a Task has insignificant parameter
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Fixes issue introduced by a923a75 and adds a test case to avoid it in the future.

In a923a75, I removed insignificant parameters to be included in the output of to_str_params. It seems this was a bit careless, i.e. it causes an error when the serialised task is passed back to from_str_params.

The goal of a923a75 was to avoid passing insignificant params to scheduler and thus potentially avoid exposing it to users via UI. I guess I can come with another, less invasive way to achieve that. (possibly in another PR)
