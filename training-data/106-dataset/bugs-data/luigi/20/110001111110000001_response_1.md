The error occurs in the `from_str_params` method of the `DummyTask` class, where it's trying to access the 'insignificant_param' key from the `params_str` dictionary, which doesn't exist.

The issue lies in the `to_str_params` method of the `DummyTask` class. The `params_str` dictionary is not being populated correctly. It's only including parameters that are considered significant, but it's not including all parameters from the `param_kwargs`.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that all parameters, both significant and insignificant, are included in the `params_str` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_str_params` method:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in self.param_kwargs.items():
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
        else:
            params_str[param_name] = param_value

    return params_str
```

With this correction, all parameters, including both significant and insignificant ones, will be included in the `params_str` dictionary. This should solve the KeyError mentioned in the error message.
