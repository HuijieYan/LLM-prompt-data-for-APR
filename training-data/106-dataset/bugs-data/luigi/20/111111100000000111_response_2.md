The potential error in the buggy function is in the for loop where it is trying to access the significant attribute of the parameter. The error is likely occurring because the `param_kwargs` attribute is not defined, which is causing the loop to fail.

The reason for the bug is that the `param_kwargs` attribute is not defined in the Task class, and it's being used in the `to_str_params` method. This is causing the loop to fail and resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, we need to either define the `param_kwargs` attribute in the Task class, or use a different attribute to iterate over the parameters and check for significance.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_str_params` method:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = self.get_params()  # Assuming get_params returns a dictionary
    for param_name, param_value in params.items():
        if param_value.significant:
            params_str[param_name] = param_value.serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```

In this corrected code, we assume that `get_params` returns a dictionary of parameters. Then, we iterate over the parameters and check for significance before including them in the `params_str` dictionary. This should fix the bug and prevent the error from occurring.
