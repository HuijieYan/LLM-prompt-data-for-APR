Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the for loop where it checks for the significance of the parameter and then tries to serialize it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be related to the removal of insignificant parameters, causing an error when the serialized task is passed back to another function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function to include all parameters and then apply a filter to remove insignificant parameters before returning the result. Additionally, adding a test case for the fixed behavior can help avoid similar issues in the future.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param in six.iteritems(params):
        if param.significant:
            params_str[param_name] = param.serialize(param.value)

    return params_str
```
