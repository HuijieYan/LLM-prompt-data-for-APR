The potential error in the problematic function is at the line `for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs)`. The error is occurring because `param_kwargs` is not defined in the class and is being accessed as if it is an attribute of the object.

The bug occurs because the `param_kwargs` attribute is not defined in the `Task` class. It seems that the intention is to access the parameters of the task, but it is not being done in the correct way.

To fix this bug, we need to access the parameters of the task in the correct way.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param in params.items():
        if param.significant:
            params_str[param_name] = param.serialize(getattr(self, param_name))
    
    return params_str
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over the dictionary obtained from `get_params()` and check if each parameter is significant. If it is, we serialize its value and store it in `params_str`. This way, we are correctly accessing the parameters of the task and avoiding the error from before.
