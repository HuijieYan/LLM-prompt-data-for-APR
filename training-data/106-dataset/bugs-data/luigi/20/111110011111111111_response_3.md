The error is occurring in the `from_str_params` method when it tries to access the `params_str` dictionary with a key that does not exist.

The reason behind the bug is that the `to_str_params` method is not including insignificant parameters in the `params_str` dictionary, but the `from_str_params` method is trying to access these parameters in the `params_str` dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `to_str_params` method to include all parameters, regardless of their significance.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_str_params` method:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```

By including all parameters in the `params_str` dictionary, the `from_str_params` method will be able to reconstruct the task correctly.

Additionally, it would be a good idea to update the method docstring to reflect the changes made:

```python
@classmethod
def from_str_params(cls, params_str=None):
    """
    Creates an instance from a str->str hash.

    :param params_str: dict of param name -> value.
    """
```

This fix will ensure that both methods are consistent in how they handle task parameters, and it should resolve the KeyError that was occurring.
