Potential error location:
The issue seems to be caused by the removal of insignificant parameters from the `to_str_params` function. This is causing an error when the serialized task is passed back to `from_str_params`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The removal of insignificant parameters is causing the error because the function is not handling these parameters properly, leading to issues when the serialized task is passed back.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of removing insignificant parameters, the function should properly handle them and include them in the output.
2. Revert the changes made in a923a75 and find a less invasive way to achieve the goal of avoiding passing insignificant params to the scheduler.

Corrected code:
```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if param_name in params and params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```
