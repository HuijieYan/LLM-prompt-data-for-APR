Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
@six.add_metaclass(Register)
class Task(object):
    """
    This is the base class of all Luigi Tasks, the base unit of work in Luigi.
    
    A Luigi Task describes a unit or work.
    
    The key methods of a Task, which must be implemented in a subclass are:
    
    * :py:meth:`run` - the computation done by this task.
    * :py:meth:`requires` - the list of Tasks that this Task depends on.
    * :py:meth:`output` - the output :py:class:`Target` that this Task creates.
    
    Parameters to the Task should be declared as members of the class, e.g.::
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        class MyTask(luigi.Task):
            count = luigi.IntParameter()
    
    
    Each Task exposes a constructor accepting all :py:class:`Parameter` (and
    values) as kwargs. e.g. ``MyTask(count=10)`` would instantiate `MyTask`.
    
    In addition to any declared properties and methods, there are a few
    non-declared properties, which are created by the :py:class:`Register`
    metaclass:
    
    ``Task.task_namespace``
      optional string which is prepended to the task name for the sake of
      scheduling. If it isn't overridden in a Task, whatever was last declared
      using `luigi.namespace` will be used.
    
    ``Task._parameters``
      list of ``(parameter_name, parameter)`` tuples for this task class
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_params(cls):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def to_str_params(self):
        """
        Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
        """
        params_str = {}
        params = dict(self.get_params())
        for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
            if params[param_name].significant:
                params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    
        return params_str

# Instructions

1. Analyze the test case and its relationship with the error message, if applicable.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Explain the reasons behind the occurrence of the bug.
4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function.
