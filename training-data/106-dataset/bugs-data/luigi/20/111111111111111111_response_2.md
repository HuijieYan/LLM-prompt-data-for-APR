The error occurs in the `to_str_params` method of the `Task` class. It is trying to serialize the `param_kwargs` into a dictionary called `params`, and then iterate over it. However, it fails to handle the case where a parameter is defined as insignificant and is not present in the `params` dictionary.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle the case where an insignificant parameter is not present in the `param_kwargs`. This causes a KeyError when trying to access a parameter that is not in the `params` dictionary.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to only include significant parameters in the `param_kwargs` dictionary and then serialize them. Another approach is to catch the KeyError and handle it gracefully by skipping the insignificant parameters during serialization.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_str_params` method:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all significant parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in self.param_kwargs.items():
        if param_name in params and params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    return params_str
```

By checking if the parameter name exists in the `params` dictionary and if it is significant before including it in the `params_str` dictionary, we ensure that only significant parameters are serialized. This prevents the KeyError from occurring and resolves the bug.
