Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the `to_str_params` method where it tries to serialize the parameters, but only includes significant parameters. This could cause issues when deserializing the task because the insignificant parameters are not included.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug was introduced in a commit that removed insignificant parameters from the output of `to_str_params`. This was done to avoid passing insignificant parameters to the scheduler and potentially exposing them to users via the UI. However, this change caused issues when deserializing the task.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach could be to include all parameters (both significant and insignificant) in the output of `to_str_params`, but mark insignificant ones in some way so that they can be excluded from the scheduler if needed. Another approach could be to handle the serialization and deserialization of significant and insignificant parameters separately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    for param_name, param_obj in self._parameters:
        param_value = getattr(self, param_name)
        params_str[param_name] = param_obj.serialize(param_value)
    return params_str
```

In the corrected code, all parameters are included in the output of `to_str_params` by iterating over `self._parameters` and serializing each parameter value. This ensures that both significant and insignificant parameters are included, and can be handled appropriately when deserializing the task.
