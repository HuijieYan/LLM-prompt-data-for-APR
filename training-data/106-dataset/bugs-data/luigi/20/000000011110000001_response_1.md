Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to be occurring in the `to_str_params` function, specifically in the loop where the `params_str` dictionary is being populated.
The bug seems to be caused by the fact that the `insignificant_param` is not being checked for significance before attempting to add it to `params_str`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop is trying to access `params_str[param_name]` without ensuring that it actually exists in `params_str`. This leads to a `KeyError` when the loop encounters an `insignificant_param`, because it is not present in the `params_str` dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by checking if the `param_name` exists in `params_str` before attempting to access it. Additionally, we should also check if the `param_name` is significant before adding it to `params_str`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def to_str_params(self):
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(self.get_params())
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if param_name in params and params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)
    return params_str
```
