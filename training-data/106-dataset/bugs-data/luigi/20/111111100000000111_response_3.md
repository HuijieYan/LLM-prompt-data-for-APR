## Issues with the provided function and reasons behind the bug

The provided `to_str_params` function is intended to convert all parameters of a Task into a string hash. However, there are a few issues in the code:
1. The `get_params` method is defined as a class method, but it should be a regular instance method. This will cause the function to fail as it's called on the instance of the class.
2. The code attempts to access `significant` property of the parameter which is not defined in the given code, leading to a potential AttributeError.

Correcting the `get_params` method to be an instance method and addressing the `significant` property issue will help in resolving the bug.

## Correction of the provided function

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_20/luigi/task.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
@six.add_metaclass(Register)
class Task(object):
    """
    This is the base class of all Luigi Tasks, the base unit of work in Luigi.
    ... (omitted code)
    """

    def get_params(self):
        """
        Get all the parameters of the task.
        This should return a dictionary of parameter names and their corresponding values.
        """
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    def to_str_params(self):
        """
        Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
        """
        params_str = {}
        params = self.get_params()
        
        for param_name, param_value in self.param_kwargs.items():
            if getattr(params[param_name], 'significant', True):  # Default to True if 'significant' attribute is not found
                params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
        
        return params_str
```

## Suggestions
It's important to make sure that the `get_params` method is returning a dictionary of parameter names and their corresponding values in order to use it in the `to_str_params` method. Additionally, if the `significant` property is defined and used for filtering significant parameters, ensure that it is implemented properly in the `Parameter` class.

It's also important to add unit tests after making the changes to ensure that the `to_str_params` method behaves as expected.
