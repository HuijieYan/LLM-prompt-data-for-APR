Potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `get_params` method is being called incorrectly. In the code, `get_params` is defined as a class method, which means it needs to have `cls` as the first argument to access class-level variables. However, when it is being called using `self.get_params()` within the `to_str_params` method, it is not being provided with the required `cls` argument.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Since `get_params` seems to be intended as a class method, the `cls` argument should be added to the method signature as the first argument.
2. When calling `get_params` within the `to_str_params` method, the method should be called on the class itself, passing the class as the first argument.
3. Ensure that the `get_params` method is returning the expected parameters which are then used in the `to_str_params` method to convert them to a str->str hash.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_20/luigi/task.py

# corrected get_params method
def get_params(cls):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected buggy function
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    params = dict(Task.get_params(self))
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        if params[param_name].significant:
            params_str[param_name] = params[param_name].serialize(param_value)

    return params_str
```
