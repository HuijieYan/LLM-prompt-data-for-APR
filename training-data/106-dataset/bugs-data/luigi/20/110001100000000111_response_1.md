Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the for loop where it iterates through the param_kwargs and attempts to serialize and add the significant parameters to the params_str dictionary.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the removal of insignificant parameters from the output of to_str_params. This causes an error when the serialized task is passed back to from_str_params because the insignificant parameters are not included.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug is to include all parameters in the output of to_str_params, regardless of their significance. This way, when the serialized task is passed back to from_str_params, all parameters will be included and the error will be avoided.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def to_str_params(self):
    """
    Convert all parameters to a str->str hash.
    """
    params_str = {}
    for param_name, param_value in six.iteritems(self.param_kwargs):
        params_str[param_name] = str(param_value)
    
    return params_str
```
