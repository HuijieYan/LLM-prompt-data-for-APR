Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the provided function is that the `prune` method of the `worker` class and the `prune` method of the `state` class are being called without considering the return values.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The `prune` method of the `Worker` class might not be returning the correct value to determine if the worker should be considered for removal.
2. The `prune` method of the `State` class might not be removing the tasks as expected.
3. There may be issues with the logic for handling necessary tasks and inactivating tasks.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `prune` method of the `Worker` and `State` classes to return a boolean value to determine if the worker or task should be removed.
2. Check the conditions for necessary tasks and inactivating tasks to ensure they are functioning as desired.
3. Update the logic for handling workers and tasks to ensure correct removal based on the return value of the `prune` methods.

Corrected Code:
```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
