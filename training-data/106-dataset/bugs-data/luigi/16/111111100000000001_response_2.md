There are multiple functions named "prune" within the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class, which is not permitted in Python. This is causing a conflict as the class contains multiple functions with the same name.

To fix this issue, we need to rename the "prune" function within the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class to a unique name. We also need to update the references to this function wherever it is being called within the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of the corrected function in this class
    def prune_tasks(self):  # Renamed the function to prune_tasks
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
    
        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()
    
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
