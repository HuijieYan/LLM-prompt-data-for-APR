Analysis:
The test case "test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant" is designed to check whether a failed task is re-enabled after 100 seconds. The task initially fails, and after 101 seconds, it's expected to be in the "PENDING" state. However, the test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the task status is still "FAILED" instead of "PENDING".

Error Location:
The potential error location is within the "prune" method of the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class. It seems that the failed task is not being correctly re-enabled.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the "prune" method is not correctly resetting the status of the failed task to "PENDING" after a certain time has elapsed.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the conditional statements in the "prune" method that handle the status of the tasks.
2. Ensure that the task status is correctly updated after a specific period, as indicated by the test case.
3. Verify that the failed tasks are being correctly re-evaluated based on the time elapsed and their retry configurations.

Corrected Code:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        else:
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # Reset the task status to PENDING

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
