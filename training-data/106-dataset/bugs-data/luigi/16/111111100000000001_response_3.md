The potential error in the provided code is the presence of multiple functions with the same name "prune" in the class CentralPlannerScheduler. This is not allowed in Python as it does not support method/function overloading based on different signatures.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the duplication of the "prune" function with different signatures. This can lead to ambiguity and makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate functions with the name "prune" and keep only one function with the desired functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function "prune":

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function with the desired functionality
    def prune(self):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers()
        for worker in active_workers:
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
    
        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()
    
        active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
        for task in active_tasks:
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
