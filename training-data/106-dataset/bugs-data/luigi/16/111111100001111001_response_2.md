The bug occurs in the prune() method of the CentralPlannerScheduler class. The method is supposed to prune tasks and workers, but it has some issues with the logic and data types.

The method is attempting to iterate through the active workers and tasks to determine if any need to be pruned. However, it's incorrectly checking for pruning criteria using the prune() method on the worker and task objects, when the actual intention seems to be to prune based on certain conditions related to workers and tasks.

Additionally, the method signature for prune(task, config) appears to be duplicated, which might lead to confusion and incorrect method calls.

To fix the bug:
1. Refactor the prune() method to ensure that it correctly checks and prunes the active workers and tasks based on the predefined logic and conditions.
2. Ensure that the duplicated prune() method signature is removed and only the correct signature with the necessary parameters is retained.

Here's the corrected code for the prune() method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.timeout >= self._config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = {task.id for task in self._state.get_necessary_tasks()}
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.should_prune(self._config):  # assuming a method named should_prune for tasks
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for checking the worker timeout and task pruning criteria has been appropriately modified.
- The unnecessary duplicated prune() method signature has been removed.
