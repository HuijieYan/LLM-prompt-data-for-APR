The potential error in the function is that it is trying to call the prune() method on the `worker` object, which is not a valid method of the worker object. 

The reason for the bug is that the prune() method is mistakenly being called on the `worker` object, which does not have a prune method. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the call to `worker.prune(self._config)` and instead just check the condition `if worker.id not in necessary_tasks`. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.id not in self._state.get_assistants():
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    remove_tasks = []

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, self._state.get_assistants())
        if task.id not in self._state.get_necessary_tasks():
            self._state.prune(task, self._config)
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
