This function is trying to perform pruning on the task graph by removing inactive workers and tasks. However, it seems that the `worker.prune` and `self._state.prune` functions are not correctly defined or used, which is causing the code to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `prune` functions for the `Worker` and `SimpleTaskState` classes are correctly implemented and called.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers()
    for worker in active_workers:
        if worker.is_inactive(self._config.worker_disconnect_delay):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.is_inactive(self._config.remove_delay):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this correction, I've replaced the usage of `worker.prune` and `self._state.prune` with the `is_inactive` method, assuming that these methods are used to check for inactivity based on the provided `worker_disconnect_delay` and `remove_delay` parameters. If the `prune` method should be implemented differently, the correction should reflect that change.
