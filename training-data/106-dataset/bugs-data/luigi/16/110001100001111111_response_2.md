The bug occurs in the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The bug prevents assistant workers from retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

The bug occurs because the `fail_dead_worker_task` method is called with the wrong arguments. It should be called with `task`, `config`, and `assistants` as parameters, but it is being called with `task`, `config`, and `assistant_ids`.

To fix the bug, the `fail_dead_worker_task` method should be called with the correct parameters. Additionally, the code using the `assistant_ids` should be refactored to use the appropriate `assistants` data.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistants = self._state.get_assistants()
    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    remove_tasks = []

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistants)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With these changes, the assistant workers should now retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
