The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code that handles task pruning and failure. The function is trying to re-enable a failed task by changing its status to 'PENDING', but it is currently remaining as 'FAILED' due to the incorrect handling of the failed task in the `prune` function.

The bug occurs because the task has the `status` set to `FAILED`, and the function is not correctly re-enabling the task after a certain time period.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to make sure that the failed task is correctly re-enabled to 'PENDING' status after a specified time period. This may involve updating the logic in the `prune` function to correctly handle the re-enabling of failed tasks after a certain time duration.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
    # Update the status of failed tasks after a certain time duration
    for task_id, task_info in self._config.tasks.items():
        if task_info['status'] == 'FAILED' and (get_current_time() - task_info['time'] > 100):
            task_info['status'] = 'PENDING'

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

This corrected code includes logic to update the status of failed tasks to 'PENDING' if a certain time duration has passed. However, the `get_current_time()` function should be replaced with the appropriate method for obtaining the current time.
