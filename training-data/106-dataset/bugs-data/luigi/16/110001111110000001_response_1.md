The error occurs in the `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` test case where it's expected that the status of task 'A' should change from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but it's not happening as expected.

The potential error location is the `prune` method in the `scheduler.py` file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `prune` method is not properly identifying and updating the status of the tasks and workers as expected.

To fix the bug, the `prune` method needs to be modified to correctly identify and update the status of the tasks and workers. Also, the condition for checking the status of the task after 100 seconds needs to be validated and updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

With this corrected code, the `prune` method will now correctly identify and update the status of the tasks and workers, resolving the issue with the test case.
