1. The test case is checking the status of a task after a certain time period. It expects the status to change from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling failed tasks and changing their status.

3. The bug occurs because the function 'prune' does not properly handle failed tasks that are eligible for retry. As a result, the status of the failed task remains 'FAILED' instead of changing to 'PENDING' after the specified time period.

4. To fix the bug, the 'prune' function needs to properly handle the retry of failed tasks. This can be achieved by adding logic to identify and retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry based on the configuration.

5. Corrected code for the 'prune' function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.retry_eligible:  # check if task is eligible for retry
            task.status = 'PENDING'  # change status to 'PENDING' for retry
            logger.info("Retrying failed task %s", task.id)
        else:
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we added logic to identify and retry failed tasks based on their eligibility for retry. This ensures that failed tasks are properly handled and their status can change to 'PENDING' for retry after the specified time period.
