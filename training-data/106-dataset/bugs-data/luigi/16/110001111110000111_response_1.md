The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` is trying to ensure that a failed task will change its status to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, and that it will be retried by the assistant worker. However, the current implementation of the `prune` function in the `scheduler.py` file does not handle the retry of failed tasks by assistant workers properly, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location is within the `prune` function where the `fail_dead_worker_task` and `prune` methods are called for tasks.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The `fail_dead_worker_task` method is supposed to retry the failed task if it's eligible for retry, but the current implementation does not do that.
2. There is a possibility that the `prune` method, when called for tasks, is removing the task entirely instead of marking it for retry.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Modify the `fail_dead_worker_task` method to check if the task is eligible for retry and re-enable it if needed.
2. Ensure that the `prune` method, when called for tasks, correctly marks the task for retry instead of removing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []
    
    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()
    
    active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
    for task in active_tasks:
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.assistant:
                self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            else:
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, we are explicitly checking if the task status is 'FAILED' and if it's an assistant task before invoking `fail_dead_worker_task`. If these conditions are met, the task will be retried by the assistant worker. Otherwise, it will be marked for removal.
