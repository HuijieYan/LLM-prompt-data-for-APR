The issue seems to be related to the task not being retried even though it is eligible for retry. This is likely due to the `remove` value being set to 1000 in the `task` object, which prevents the task from being retried.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug could include ensuring that the `remove` value is set to `None` for tasks that are eligible for retry, and then modifying the logic of the `prune` function to take this into account.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.remove is not None:
                task.remove = None
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the `remove` value for the `task` object is checked, and if it is set to a non-None value, it is reset to None. This ensures that the task is eligible for retry if it meets other retry conditions.
