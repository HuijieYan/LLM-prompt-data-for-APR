The error occurs in the `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` test function. The test expects the status of task 'A' to change from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but the status remains 'FAILED'.

The issue is likely in the `prune` function in the provided code. The `fail_dead_worker_task` function is called with parameters 'task', 'self._config', and 'assistant_ids'. However, the 'task' parameter is passed first, while the function signature shows it as the second parameter.

This code bug is likely causing the failed tasks to not be re-enabled after the configured retry delay, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the order of parameters in the `fail_dead_worker_task` function call.
2. Ensure that the failed task is re-enabled after the configured retry delay.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:
```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):  # prune task before checking for failure
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, assistant_ids, self._config)  # switch the parameters
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code:
- The order of parameters in the `fail_dead_worker_task` function call has been switched.
- The failed task is first pruned and then checked for re-enabling based on the retry configuration.

This should address the issue and allow failed tasks to be re-enabled after the retry delay, fixing the bug.
