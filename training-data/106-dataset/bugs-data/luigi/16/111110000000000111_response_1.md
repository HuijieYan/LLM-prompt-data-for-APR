The issue seems to be related to the Assistant workers not retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry. The function "prune" is responsible for handling the removal of inactive workers and tasks, but it also seems to be failing to handle the retry of failed tasks by Assistant workers.

Looking at the code, the issue could be with the logic that determines whether a task is eligible for retry and whether Assistant workers should retry the task.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling the retry of failed tasks by Assistant workers needs to be added to the "prune" function.

Here's the corrected "prune" function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)

        # Logic for retrying failed tasks by Assistant workers
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.failed and task.worker_type == "assistant":
                # Add logic to retry the failed task with Assistant workers
                self._state.retry_task(task)
            else:
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected function, I included logic to retry the failed tasks specifically for Assistant workers. This should address the issue where Assistant workers were not retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
