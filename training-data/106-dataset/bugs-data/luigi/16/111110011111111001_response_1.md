The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The issue is with the type comparison in the line:
`if self._state.prune(task, self._config):`

The error message from the test function `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` shows that the status of the task `A` is not changing from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds as expected. This indicates that the pruning process is not working correctly, and the status of the task is not being updated.

The potential error location is within the loop where tasks are being pruned and removed. This loop should correctly update the status of the tasks and remove them if necessary.

The bug is occurring because the comparison `if self._state.prune(task, self._config):` is not working as expected, and as a result, the status of the task is not being updated.

To fix the bug, the comparison `if self._state.prune(task, self._config):` should be replaced with `if self._state.prune(task.id, self._config):` assuming that `prune` method expects the first parameter to be the task ID.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task.id, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

This correction assumes that the `prune` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class expects the task ID as the first parameter. If this assumption is incorrect, the code should be adjusted accordingly.
