1. The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` sets up a scenario where a task 'A' is added to a worker 'X' as a failed task with the assistant flag set to True. It then checks if the task status changes to 'PENDING' after 101 seconds. However, the assertion fails as the status remains 'FAILED'.

2. The potential error location is within the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class.

3. The reason behind the bug is that the `fail_dead_worker_task` method is not properly updating the status of failed tasks with assistants.

4. To fix the bug, there are a few possible approaches:
   - Update the logic inside the `prune` method to correctly handle the status update for failed tasks with assistants.
   - Ensure that the `fail_dead_worker_task` method properly handles the status update for failed tasks with assistants.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)

        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []

        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()

        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status == "FAILED" and task.assistant:  # Update status for failed tasks with assistants
                task.status = "PENDING"
            else:
                self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
