The potential error location in the code is the `prune` method. It seems that there are multiple `prune` methods with different signatures, which might be causing confusion and leading to incorrect method calls.

The bug occurs because there are multiple `prune` methods in the same class with different signatures. This could be causing confusion and leading to incorrect method calls. Additionally, there are some method calls without the `self` parameter, which could also be a source of error.

To fix the bug, we can rename the `prune` method to something more descriptive and remove the duplicate method with the name `prune`. We should also make sure that the method calls within the `prune` method have the correct signatures and the `self` parameter is passed where required.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune_task_graph(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):  # Assuming worker has a prune method
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        self.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune_task(task, self._config):  # Assuming _state has a prune_task method
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
