The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to call the 'prune' method without passing the 'task' and 'config' arguments, which are required by the 'prune' method in the 'State' class. This could result in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'prune' method to accept the 'task' and 'config' arguments, and then pass them to the 'prune' method of the 'State' class.

Here's the corrected code for the 'prune' method:

```python
def prune(self, task, config):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
