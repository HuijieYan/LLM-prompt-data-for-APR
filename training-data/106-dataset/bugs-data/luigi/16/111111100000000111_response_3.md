The buggy function `prune` in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class seems to have multiple definitions, which is not allowed in Python. The function is being defined with different signatures in the same class, leading to ambiguity and confusion.

The reason for the bug is the duplicate definition of the `prune` function in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. This causes the function to be overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect pruning of tasks and workers.

To fix the bug, the duplicate definitions of the `prune` function should be removed and the code logic should be consolidated into a single `prune` function with the appropriate parameters. The logic for pruning tasks and workers should be properly handled within this consolidated function.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected and consolidated prune function
    def prune(self, config):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers()
        for worker in active_workers:
            if worker.prune(config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
        
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
        
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
        
        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()
        
        active_tasks = self._state.get_active_tasks()
        for task in active_tasks:
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
        
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the duplicate `prune` function definitions have been removed and the logic for pruning tasks and workers has been consolidated into a single function with the appropriate parameters. Now the `prune` function takes the `config` parameter as expected and handles the pruning logic accordingly.
