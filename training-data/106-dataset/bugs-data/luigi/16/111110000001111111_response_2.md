The issue here seems to be with the handling of failed tasks and retrying them in the `prune` function of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The code is not properly handling the retry configuration for failed tasks when there are assistant workers involved.

The bug seems to be related to the failure processing logic in the `prune` function. It appears that the code does not correctly consider the retry configurations for failed tasks and how it should be handled by the assistant workers.

To fix the bug, you should modify the logic in the `prune` function to properly handle retry configurations for failed tasks and ensure that assistant workers can retry failed tasks when they are eligible for retry.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        elif task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In this corrected code, we have modified the logic to properly handle the retry configurations for failed tasks and ensure that assistant workers can retry failed tasks when they are eligible for retry. We have also included the `fail_dead_worker_task` method to handle assistant workers retrying failed tasks.

With these changes, the assistant workers should now properly retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.
