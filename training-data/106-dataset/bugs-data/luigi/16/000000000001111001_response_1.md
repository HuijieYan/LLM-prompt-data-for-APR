The potential error location within the problematic function is the section responsible for evaluating the conditions of `worker.prune(self._config)` and `self._state.prune(task, self._config)`. These conditions are likely causing the pruning algorithm to not work as intended.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The logic for removing tasks and workers based on the prune conditions may not be working as expected.
2. The conditions used to decide whether to remove workers and tasks are not being properly evaluated.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for prune operations on workers and tasks need to be re-evaluated and the logic for removing workers and tasks should be revised.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._config.remove_delay is not None and \
           self._config.remove_delay > 0 and self._config.remove_delay <= task.time:
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for removing tasks have been adjusted to use the `remove_delay` value from the `_config` object. It ensures that tasks are removed based on the configured delay.
