The bug occurs in the `prune` method because the function defines multiple methods with the same name `prune` but different signatures. This makes the methods ambiguous and difficult to call directly. 

To fix this bug, you should rename the methods with unique names and unique function signatures. You should analyze the functionality provided by each of these methods and give them unique and descriptive names to reflect their specific functionality.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_16/luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def prune_task_graph(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune_task(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
