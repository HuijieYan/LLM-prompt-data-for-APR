Potential error location:
The error might be occurring in the section where the function is determining if a task can be retried or not. It seems that the function is failing to retry tasks that are eligible for retry.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug might be occurring because the code is not properly checking for the retry configuration of the failed tasks. It is also not properly considering the eligibility of tasks for retry.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check and properly handle the retry configuration of the failed tasks.
2. Ensure that the code properly identifies and handles tasks that are eligible for retry.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and task.retry_eligible() and self._state.prune(task, self._config):  # Check for task retry eligibility
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
