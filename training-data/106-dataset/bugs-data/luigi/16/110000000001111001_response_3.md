The bug in the provided function is that the remove variable for tasks is not being properly updated, and the worker id is being added to the remove_workers list without checking for duplicates.

The issue is likely occurring due to the logic for removing workers and tasks not being handled properly. Additionally, the `self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)` line is not being used correctly.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to:
1. Update the logic for removing workers and tasks to ensure that the correct items are being removed from the state.
2. Ensure that duplicate worker ids are not added to the remove_workers list.
3. Use the `self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)` line correctly to handle failed dead worker tasks.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = set()
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.add(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = set()

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = set()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.add(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected function, the remove_workers and remove_tasks variables are set as sets to avoid duplications. The logic for finding necessary tasks is updated, and the correct sets are used throughout the function.
