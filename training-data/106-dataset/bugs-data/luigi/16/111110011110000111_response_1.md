The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` is checking if a failed task changes its status to PENDING after 100 seconds. However, the assertion failed because the task's status remained as FAILED instead of changing to PENDING.

The potential error location within the `prune` function is in the logic that handles the failure of tasks when assistant workers are involved.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the logic that determines when to retry the failed tasks by the assistant workers. It seems that the function is not properly handling the retry logic for failed tasks when assistant workers are involved.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic for retrying failed tasks in the `prune` function and ensuring that it properly handles the retry configurations for assistant workers.
2. Checking if the necessary conditions for enabling the retry of failed tasks by assistant workers are properly implemented in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
                if task.assistant and task.status == FAILED:
                    task.status = PENDING  # retry the failed task by the assistant worker
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task_id in remove_tasks:
        self._state.inactivate_task(task_id)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
In the corrected code, we have added a condition to check if the task is an assistant worker and its status is FAILED, and then change the status to PENDING to enable the retry of the failed task by the assistant worker. This should fix the issue related to assistant workers not retrying failed tasks.
