The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` is checking whether a failed task (task_id='A') changes its status to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the task status remains 'FAILED' instead of changing to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles re-enabling failed tasks for assistant workers. The function `prune` in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class is responsible for this logic.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `prune` function is not properly handling the re-enabling of failed tasks for assistant workers. It fails to change the status of the failed task to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `prune` function should correctly identify and re-enable failed tasks for assistant workers by updating their status to 'PENDING' after the specified time.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)
        else:
            if task.status == 'FAILED' and task.worker_running in assistant_ids:
                if self._state.runnable(task):
                    task.status = 'PENDING'

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, after identifying failed tasks for assistant workers, it checks if the task is eligible for a retry (based on the configuration) and updates the status to 'PENDING' if it is. This should resolve the issue with failed tasks not being retried by assistant workers.
