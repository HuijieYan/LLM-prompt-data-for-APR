Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the section where the function is supposed to retry failed tasks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- It seems that the code is not properly handling the retry of failed tasks for assistant workers.
- The function is not checking for the retriable status of failed tasks and not initiating a retry action for eligible tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the function to check for the retriable status of failed tasks.
- Implement a retry mechanism for eligible tasks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            # Check if task is retriable and initiate retry
            if task.should_retry():
                self._state.retry_task(task.id)
            else:
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
