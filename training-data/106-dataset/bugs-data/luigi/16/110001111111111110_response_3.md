The problem with the `prune` method seems to be that it is not correctly identifying tasks as failed and then retrying them after a certain period of time. The expected behavior is that the failed task should change its status to "PENDING" after a certain period of time.

Here's the corrected `prune` method based on the provided information:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(worker.id for worker in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    current_time = get_current_time()  # Assuming a function named get_current_time that returns the current time
    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status == 'FAILED' and current_time - task.time >= self._config.retry_delay:
            task.status = 'PENDING'
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

I've added a condition to check if the task has failed and if the retry delay has passed. If so, it changes the task's status to "PENDING" and removes it from the active tasks.

Additionally, the `current_time` variable is assumed to be obtained from a function `get_current_time()`.

This should help the task to reset to "PENDING" after a certain period of time, as expected in the test case.
