The potential error in the provided function is that it seems to contain duplicate code for the same `prune` method. This can lead to confusion and potentially cause unwanted behavior in the program.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `prune` method is defined twice within the class `CentralPlannerScheduler`.

To fix the bug, the duplicate definition of the `prune` method needs to be removed and the functionality of the second `prune` method should be incorporated into the first `prune` method.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CentralPlannerScheduler(Scheduler):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of the corrected function in this class
    def prune(self):
        logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
        remove_workers = []
        assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
        remove_tasks = []
    
        for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
            if worker.prune(self._config):
                logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
                remove_workers.append(worker.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)
    
        if assistant_ids:
            necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
        else:
            necessary_tasks = ()
    
        for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
            self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
            if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
    
        self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)
    
        logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
