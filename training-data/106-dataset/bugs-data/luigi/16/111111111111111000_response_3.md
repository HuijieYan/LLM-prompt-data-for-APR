The issue in the original function `prune` is that it did not accept any parameters to update the list of active workers. I have added an optional parameter `workers` to the function so that it can accept a list of active workers if necessary. Additionally, I made sure to use `active_tasks.values()` to iterate over the tasks in the `active_tasks` dictionary.

I have also modified the function to return the variables as expected based on the specified input parameters and provided test function.
