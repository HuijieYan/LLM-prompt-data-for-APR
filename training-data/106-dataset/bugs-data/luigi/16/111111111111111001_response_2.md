The issue seems to be with the `fail_dead_worker_task` and `prune` methods within the `prune` function. The `fail_dead_worker_task` method sets the status of the task to 'FAILED', while the `prune` method is supposed to remove the task if it is not necessary.

The reason for the bug is that the `fail_dead_worker_task` method sets the status of the task to 'FAILED' regardless of whether it is necessary or not. This prevents the task from being removed even if it is not necessary.

To fix this, we need to update the `fail_dead_worker_task` method to set the status of the task to 'FAILED' only if it is not necessary. We can achieve this by checking if the task is necessary before setting the status to 'FAILED' in the `fail_dead_worker_task` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
