Potential error location: 

The error may be occurring in the for loop that iterates over the active tasks, as it is responsible for failing dead worker tasks and removing tasks from the state. It seems that there is a missing logic for retrying failed tasks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The bug seems to be caused by missing logic for retrying failed tasks in the provided function. This is causing the assistant workers to never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Introduce a logic for retrying failed tasks within the for loop that iterates over the active tasks.
2. Identify the retry configurations for the tasks and implement the retry logic accordingly.

```python
# Corrected function
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        
        # Logic for retrying failed tasks
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            if task.should_retry():  # Assuming task has a method should_retry() to check if it's eligible for retry
                task.retry()  # Assuming task has a method retry() to retry the task
            else:
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)
       
    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
