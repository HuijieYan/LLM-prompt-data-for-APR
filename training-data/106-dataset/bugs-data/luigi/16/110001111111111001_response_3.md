The error occurs because the task 'A' is not transitioning to the 'PENDING' state after 101 seconds as expected. This transition is handled by the `prune` method in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class, which is the problematic function.

The bug in the `prune` method seems to be that it is not properly updating the state of the tasks and workers. Specifically, it is not updating the tasks to 'PENDING' after the required time, as evidenced by the failed assertion in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the `prune` method correctly updates the status of the tasks and workers based on the specified conditions. This might involve debugging the logic within the `prune` method, checking the conditions for transitioning tasks to the 'PENDING' state, and ensuring that the correct methods are called to update the task status.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

        # Update the task status to 'PENDING' if the condition is met
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and not self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            task.update_status('PENDING')

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, after checking for the conditions to prune the task, there is an additional check to update the task status to 'PENDING' if the condition is not met. This should address the bug and ensure that tasks are transitioned to the correct state based on the specified conditions.
