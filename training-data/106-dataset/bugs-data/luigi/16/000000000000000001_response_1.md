Potential error location: 
The error could be in the conditional statement `if assistant_ids:` as well as in the `for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():` loop. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the cases where `assistant_ids` is empty, and the conditional statement is incorrectly checking for the existence of `assistant_ids` instead of checking for its emptiness. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the conditional statement to `if assistant_ids:`
2. Add an `else` statement to handle the case where `assistant_ids` is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if not necessary_tasks or task.id not in necessary_tasks:
            if self._state.prune(task, self._config):
                remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
