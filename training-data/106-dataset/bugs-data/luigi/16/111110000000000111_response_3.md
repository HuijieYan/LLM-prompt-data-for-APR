The potential error in the provided function is that it does not properly handle the retry of failed tasks by assistant workers.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not check for failed tasks that are eligible for retry by assistant workers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `prune` function to properly handle the retry of failed tasks by assistant workers.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)
        else:
            # Check if there are failed tasks eligible for retry
            if worker.assistant and worker.failed_tasks:
                for task in worker.failed_tasks:
                    if task.eligible_for_retry():
                        remove_workers.remove(worker.id)
                        worker.retry_task(task)  # Retry the failed task
    
    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
``` 

In the corrected code, we added logic to check for failed tasks eligible for retry by assistant workers, and then retry those failed tasks.

This should address the issue of assistant workers not retrying failed tasks when eligible for retry.
