The issue lies within the `prune` method in the buggy function. The `prune` method is attempting to reset the status of a failed task to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds, but the status remains 'FAILED'.

The potential error location within the `prune` method is the logic for resetting the status of a failed task to 'PENDING'.

The bug occurred because the logic for resetting the status of a failed task to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds is not implemented correctly. The function is not handling the transition from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `prune` method to handle the transition from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' after 100 seconds.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = {w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants()}
    remove_tasks = []

    necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessary if-else condition and creates a `necessary_tasks` set to handle the transition from 'FAILED' to 'PENDING' as expected. This change should address the bug identified in the test.
