The test case `test_re_enable_failed_task_assistant` is trying to verify that a task changes status from `FAILED` to `PENDING` after a certain time has passed. However, the test is failing with an AssertionError because the status is not changing as expected.

The potential error location in the code is the part where the statuses of the tasks are being updated based on time elapsed and worker actions.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrectly handling the task status update logic in the `prune()` function. It appears that the function is intended to update the status of a task from `FAILED` to `PENDING` after a certain time has passed, but the current implementation is not fulfilling this requirement.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for updating the task status based on time elapsed and worker actions is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the conditions for changing task status and the corresponding status updates are accurately reflected in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune()` function:

```python
# corrected 'prune' method
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

        # Update task status based on elapsed time and worker actions
        if task.is_failed() and task.worker_running is None:
            if task.time_running is not None and time.time() - task.time_running > self._config.retry_delay:
                task.status = 'PENDING'

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, after checking for failed tasks with no associated running worker, the code updates the status of the task from `FAILED` to `PENDING` if the elapsed time satisfies the condition specified by `retry_delay`.
