The issue is likely caused by the incorrect condition for retrying failed tasks by assistant workers. In the given buggy function, there is a loop over the active tasks, where any task that is not in the necessary tasks set and is eligible for pruning is removed. This removes the tasks without considering whether they are eligible for retry or not.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be updated to also check if the task is eligible for retry, and if so, proceed with retrying the task.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` function:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config) and self._state.get_task_failures(task.id) < self._config.disable_failures:
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```

In the corrected code, an additional check `self._state.get_task_failures(task.id) < self._config.disable_failures` is added to ensure that tasks eligible for retry are not removed.

This will address the issue where assistant workers do not retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry. With this change, the assistant workers will now consider the retry configurations for failed tasks and proceed with retrying them accordingly.
