The bug is occurring in the `prune` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The issue seems to be related to the `fail_dead_worker_task` method not being called with the correct parameters.

It seems that the `fail_dead_worker_task` method is being called with incorrect parameters `task`, `config`, and `assistant_ids`. It should be called with `task`, `self._config`, and `assistant_ids` respectively.

This bug is causing the assistant workers to never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

To fix the bug, we need to update the call to the `fail_dead_worker_task` method with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self):
    logger.info("Starting pruning of task graph")
    remove_workers = []
    for worker in self._state.get_active_workers():
        if worker.prune(self._config):
            logger.info("Worker %s timed out (no contact for >=%ss)", worker, self._config.worker_disconnect_delay)
            remove_workers.append(worker.id)

    self._state.inactivate_workers(remove_workers)

    assistant_ids = set(w.id for w in self._state.get_assistants())
    remove_tasks = []

    if assistant_ids:
        necessary_tasks = self._state.get_necessary_tasks()
    else:
        necessary_tasks = ()

    for task in self._state.get_active_tasks():
        self._state.fail_dead_worker_task(task, self._config, assistant_ids)
        if task.id not in necessary_tasks and self._state.prune(task, self._config):
            remove_tasks.append(task.id)

    self._state.inactivate_tasks(remove_tasks)

    logger.info("Done pruning task graph")
```
