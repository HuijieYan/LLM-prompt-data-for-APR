1. The test case `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` is trying to ensure that when a task 'A' is added and marked as non-runnable, calling the `get_work` function with worker 'Y' and setting assistant to True should return a task_id of None. However, the actual result is False.

2. The potential error location within the `get_work` function may be in the `if best_task:` block where the `best_task` is being set and then used to set the status of the task and update task history.

3. The bug might be occurring because the `best_task` is not properly being evaluated within the for loop and as a result, it may not be getting set to the correct value. This could be leading to an incorrect task_id being returned.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for setting the `best_task` within the for loop and ensure that it properly evaluates the available tasks to find the highest priority task with no dependencies and available resources. Additionally, the logic for setting the status of the task and updating task history should be reviewed to ensure it is accurately reflecting the state of the task.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node no dependencies and available resources.

    # Resource checking looks both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both
    # checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other
    # workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely
    # nothing it can wait for

    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendents
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])

                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
