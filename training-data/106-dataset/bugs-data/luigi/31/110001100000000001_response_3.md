The potential error location within the given function is in the `get_work` function. The function is trying to find the highest priority node with no dependencies and available resources, but it seems to have issues with resource checking and finding the best task.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be:
- Inconsistent resource checking, both currently available resources and potential resources if all running tasks were to die and rescheduled greedily.
- Task status checking seems to be incomplete, which may lead to incorrect task selection.
- There might be issues with keeping track of resources used in greedy scheduling.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Review the resource checking logic to ensure that it accurately reflects the current and potential resources.
- Thoroughly check the task status and workers' availability to make sure the best task is selected.
- Debug the resource tracking to ensure it is functioning as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, info=[('assistant', assistant)])

                          for worker in self.get_active_workers())
    
    tasks = list(self.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=lambda task: self._rank(task), reverse=True)
    
    for task in tasks:
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (assistant or worker in task.workers):
            other_worker = self.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)
    
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and (assistant or worker in task.workers):
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1
    
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount
    
        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):

                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1
    
                        for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                            greedy_resources[resource] += amount
    
                        break
