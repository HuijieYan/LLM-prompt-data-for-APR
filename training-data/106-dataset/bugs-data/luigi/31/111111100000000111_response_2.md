The issue appears to be with the `get_work` method in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The code iterates over tasks and performs various checks to find the best task to assign to a worker, but the logic seems unnecessarily complex and prone to errors.

The potential bug in the get_work method:
1. The "PENDING" status should be enclosed in quotes as it is a string and not defined as a variable.
2. The comparison of task status should be done using the `==` operator to check for equality.
3. The usage of `'assistant'` is ambiguous in the `add_worker` method.

A more straightforward approach to fixing the bug would involve simplifying the logic, checking for potential coding errors, and clarifying the checks performed on tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    
    best_task = None
    running_tasks = []
    
    used_resources = self._used_resources()  # Assuming _used_resources() returns used resources
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    
    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank(), reverse=True)
    
    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)
        elif task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            n_unique_pending += 1
        elif task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount
        elif self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources) and in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
            best_task = task
            break
    
    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': len(tasks),
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}
    
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)  # Assuming RUNNING is a constant
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)
    
        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
    
    return reply
```

In the corrected code:
1. I have enclosed the string statuses ('PENDING', 'RUNNING') in quotes throughout the method.
2. I have simplified the checks and included the break statement to exit the loop once the best task is found.
