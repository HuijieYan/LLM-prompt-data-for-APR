The buggy function "get_work" seems to be having an issue with determining the best task to assign to a worker. The function has a conditional check for "self._schedulable(task)" and "self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources)", but it doesn't check whether the task status is 'PENDING' or if it's already assigned to a worker. 

The problem seems to be the logic for checking for the best task to assign, as it's possible that the task's status is not considered in the decision-making process. Additionally, the function doesn't handle or update the availability of resources accurately.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking the best task should be refined to consider the task status, its assignment to a worker, and the availability of resources. Additionally, the resource allocation logic should be updated to reflect the actual used and pending tasks accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_work" function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
  
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []
  
    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = dict((worker.id, worker.info.get('workers', 1)) for worker in self._state.get_active_workers())
    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank(), reverse=True)
  
    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)
  
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers and len(task.workers) == 0:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            n_unique_pending += 1
  
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and len(task.workers) == 0 and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
            best_task = task
            break
  
    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks, 'running_tasks': running_tasks, 'task_id': None, 'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}
  
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)
  
        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
  
    return reply
```
In the provided corrected code, the conditions for checking the best task have been refined to consider the task status, its assignment to a worker, and the availability of resources. This should address the issues identified in the original buggy function.
