The test case is trying to check if an assistant worker ('Y') can get a task ('A') to run, but the assertion fails. This is likely due to the fact that the task 'A' is not set as 'runnable', so the get_work method should not return a task that is not runnable. 

The potential error location is in the condition for selecting the best task:
```python
if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
    if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
        best_task = task
    else:
        workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
        for task_worker in workers:
            if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                # use up a worker
                greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1
                # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                    greedy_resources[resource] += amount
                break
```

The get_work function selects the best task to assign to a worker by iterating over all tasks, checking if the task is schedulable and if resources are available. However, it fails to consider the 'runnable' status of the task.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for the 'runnable' status of the task within the loop that iterates over tasks. If the task is not runnable, it should be skipped. Additionally, we should make sure that the best_task is only set if it is runnable.

Here's the corrected code for the get_work function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    for task in tasks:
        if task.status != RUNNABLE or not self._schedulable(task) or not self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            continue

        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers

        if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
            best_task = task
            break
        else:
            workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
            for task_worker in workers:
                if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                    # use up a worker
                    greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1

                    # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                    for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                        greedy_resources[resource] += amount

                    best_task = task
                    break

    # ... (remaining code)

    return reply
