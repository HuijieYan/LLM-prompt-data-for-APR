The bug is occurring because the `task.status` and `in_workers` conditions are not being met which is resulting in the `best_task` not being set. Additionally, the state of the `best_task` is not being updated correctly.

To fix the bug, the following changes are recommended:
1. Update the condition for `task.status` to check for the value `'PENDING'` instead of `PENDING` to ensure the comparison is being made with the correct data type.
2. Update the condition for `in_workers` to set its value to `True` when the worker is in the list of task workers.
3. Set the state of the `best_task` to `RUNNING` and update its attributes accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # ... (other parts of the code remain unchanged) ...

    if best_task:
        best_task.status = 'RUNNING'  # Set the status of the best_task to RUNNING
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)  # Update the task history

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

With these changes, the function should correctly set the `best_task` and update its status according to the conditions.
