The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the identification of the best task based on certain criteria and updating the task's status. The function is not correctly identifying and updating the best task according to its criteria.

The reasons for this bug could be the following:
1. The function is not properly iterating over all tasks and checking for their status and worker assignment.
2. The comparison of available resources and the selection of the best task is not being handled correctly.
3. The status update and assignment of the best task to a worker are not being done accurately.

The following approaches can be considered to fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function iterates over all tasks and correctly identifies the best task based on the specified criteria.
2. Verify that the comparison of available resources and the selection of the best task is handled accurately.
3. Update the status of the best task and assign it to the worker correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
        
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = {worker.id: worker.info.get('workers', 1) for worker in self._state.get_active_workers()}

    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank(), reverse=True)

    for task in tasks:
        if task.workers and 'Y' in task.workers:
            if task.status == 'RUNNING':
                other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
                more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
                if other_worker is not None:
                    more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                    running_tasks.append(more_info)
            elif task.status == 'PENDING':
                locally_pending_tasks += 1
                if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                    n_unique_pending += 1
            elif task.status == 'RUNNING' and task.worker_running in greedy_workers:
                greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
                for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                    greedy_resources[resource] += amount
        if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if 'Y' in task.workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
                best_task.status = 'RUNNING'
                best_task.worker_running = worker
                best_task.time_running = time.time()
                self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
                self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)
                break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': best_task.id if best_task else None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
