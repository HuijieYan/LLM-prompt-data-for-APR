The error occurs in the `get_work` method of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. The bug seems to be related to task status comparison and assignment.

The issue can be found in the following section of the code:
```python
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)
```
The bug is occurring because `best_task` might have already been assigned the status 'RUNNING' before this check, and changing it here again might be causing the issue.

Considering the input parameters, the expected value for `best_task` would be a task object with ID 'A', status 'RUNNING', and 'worker_running' already assigned as 'Y'.

To fix this, we need to first check if the status of the `best_task` is not 'RUNNING' before updating its status.

Here's the corrected `get_work` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... existing implementation ...

    if not best_task:  # Check if no best_task is assigned
        for task in tasks:  # Loop through tasks
            in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
            if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
                if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                    best_task = task
                else:
                    workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                    for task_worker in workers:
                        if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                            # use up a worker
                            greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1
                            # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                                greedy_resources[resource] += amount
                            break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task and best_task.status != 'RUNNING':  # Check if best_task is not already running
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

By incorporating these changes, the function should now correctly assign the `best_task` and update its status only if it is not already running.
