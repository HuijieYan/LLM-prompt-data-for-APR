It seems that the function `get_work` is not working as expected. The test `test_assistant_get_work_external_task` is failing because it expects the result of `self.sch.get_work('Y', assistant=True)['task_id']` to be `None`, but it is returning some other value.

The potential error in the function seems to be related to how it's handling the state and status of the tasks. It is not properly identifying the next task to be executed by the worker.

One possible reason for the bug could be the incorrect logic in the for loop where it iterates over the tasks and tries to find the best task for the given worker. The function is not properly checking if the task is PENDING and available for the worker to execute.

To fix the bug, the function should properly check the status and availability of the tasks for the worker, update the state and status of the tasks accordingly, and return the correct task_id.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Initialize the best_task to None
    best_task = None

    # Iterate over the tasks to find the best task for the worker
    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
            best_task = task
            break  # Once the best_task is found, break the loop

    # Update the state and status of the best_task
    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)

    # Return the reply with the best_task information
    if best_task:
        reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks, 'running_tasks': running_tasks, 'task_id': best_task.id, 'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending, 'task_family': best_task.family, 'task_module': getattr(best_task, 'module', None), 'task_params': best_task.params}
    else:
        reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks, 'running_tasks': running_tasks, 'task_id': None, 'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    return reply
```
In the corrected code, I've updated the logic to properly find the best_task for the worker based on its status and availability. Once the best_task is found, it updates the state and status of the task and returns the reply with the best_task information.
