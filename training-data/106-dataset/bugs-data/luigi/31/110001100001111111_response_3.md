The bug in the `get_work` function likely occurs due to incorrect logic in selecting the best task to assign to a worker. The function needs to iterate over all tasks and find the highest priority task that has no dependencies and available resources. However, the current implementation has issues with resource checking and determining the best task. Additionally, there are problems with updating the status of the selected task and worker details in the task history.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the best task to assign, update its status, set worker details, and return the remaining tasks without any failed descendants. This will involve revising the resource checking logic, updating the task status, and returning the correct response with task details.

Here's the corrected `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains the same)
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])

    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = {worker.id: worker.info.get('workers', 1) for worker in self._state.get_active_workers()}

    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: self._rank(x), reverse=True)

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = (assistant or (worker in task.workers))
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
            greedy_workers[task.worker_running] -= 1
            for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                greedy_resources[resource] += amount

        if best_task is None and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
            if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
            else:
                workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                for task_worker in workers:
                    if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                        # use up a worker
                        greedy_workers[task_worker] -= 1

                        # keep track of the resources used in greedy scheduling
                        for resource, amount in six.iteritems((task.resources or {})):
                            greedy_resources[resource] += amount

                        break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks, 'running_tasks': running_tasks, 'task_id': None, 'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, 'RUNNING', self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task.id, 'RUNNING', host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

In this corrected code, the logic for selecting the best task and updating task status and worker details is improved. Additionally, the response returned includes the correct error-free values.
