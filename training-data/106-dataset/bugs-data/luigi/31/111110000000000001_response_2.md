Here's the full code of the fixed `get_work` function:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node no dependencies and available
    # resources.

    # Resource checking looks both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both
    # checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other
    # workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely
    # nothing it can wait for

    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendents
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
    best_task = None
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []

    used_resources = self._used_resources()
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0
    greedy_workers = dict((worker.id, worker.info.get('workers', 1))
                          for worker in self._state.get_active_workers())

    tasks = list(self._state.get_pending_tasks())
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)  # Fix: remove parentheses when passing _rank function

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            # Return a list of currently running tasks to the client,
            # makes it easier to troubleshoot
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
