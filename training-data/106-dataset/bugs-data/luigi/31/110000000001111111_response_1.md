The bug in the function seems to be related to the process of finding the best task. It is likely that the function is not correctly identifying the best task based on the conditions specified. 

In the given test case, the expected return should have the `best_task` as a Task with status 'RUNNING', with locally_pending_tasks as 1, and the worker set to 'Y'. But the returned values do not match these expectations.

The potential error in the code may be due to incorrect evaluation of the conditions for the best task selection. It seems that the conditions and checks within the loops for iterating over the tasks are not functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, we should review the conditions for selecting the best task, considering the status, workers, and available resources. Additionally, the increment or update of variables such as `locally_pending_tasks`, `greedy_workers`, and `reply` should be based on the correct checks and conditions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node no dependencies and available
    # resources.

    # Resource checking looks both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both
    # checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other
    # workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely
    # nothing it can wait for

    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker, {'host': host})
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker, [('assistant', assistant)])
