Potential error location: 
The potential error could be in the logic for selecting the best task. It seems that the current logic has issues in determining the best task based on the status and availability of resources.

Reason for the bug:
The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of task status and resource availability. The current logic for selecting the best task does not seem to consider all the necessary conditions for a task to be considered the best option.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for selecting the best task and ensure that it considers all the necessary conditions such as task status, worker availability, and resource availability.
2. Update the comparison logic for checking if a task is the best option to be executed.

Corrected code:
