The error in this function is that it is not handling the case where the task.status is 'PENDING' and in_workers is True. This causes the locally_pending_tasks to always be 0 and the best_task to never be assigned. 

The reason behind this bug is that the function is not properly identifying pending tasks for the given worker and assistant parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the section of the code that checks for pending tasks and assign the best task correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def get_work(self, worker, host=None, assistant=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = assistant or worker in task.workers
        if task.status == 'RUNNING' and in_workers:
            # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
            
        if task.status == 'PENDING' and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 0 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1
            elif best_task is None:  # Add this check
                best_task = task  # Assign the task as the best task

            if task.status == 'RUNNING' and (task.worker_running in greedy_workers):
                # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

            if not best_task and self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, greedy_resources):
                if in_workers and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                    best_task = task
                else:
                    workers = itertools.chain(task.workers, [worker]) if assistant else task.workers
                    for task_worker in workers:
                        if greedy_workers.get(task_worker, 0) > 0:
                            # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

The corrected code now properly identifies pending tasks and assigns the best task based on the worker and assistant parameters.
