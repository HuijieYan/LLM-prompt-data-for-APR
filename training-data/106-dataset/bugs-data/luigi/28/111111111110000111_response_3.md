The error message in the test function shows that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected value when checking for the existence of a table. This suggests that the issue might be related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.

The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to incorrect comparisons between table names.

To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase during the comparison, the `table_exists` function will now be able to perform case-insensitive checks for the existence of a table.

The corrected code should address the issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, as expected.
