The `table_exists` method is responsible for checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The method constructs a Hive command based on the input parameters and then runs it using the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The buggy behavior is likely caused by the way the Hive command is constructed and executed. The problem seems to be related to the construction of the Hive command when checking for table existence with or without a specified partition.

To fix the bug, the Hive command construction and execution should be revised based on the provided input parameters. Additionally, the conditional checks for the presence of the table in the stdout are not robust, and they should be revised.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_filter = ' and '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        command = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_filter)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```
