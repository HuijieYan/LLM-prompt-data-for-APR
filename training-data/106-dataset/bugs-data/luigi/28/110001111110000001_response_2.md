The error occurs when the `test_table_exists` function is run. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` because the `self.assertTrue(returned)` check failed, indicating that the function returned `False` instead of `True`. This suggests that there is a bug in the `table_exists` function.

The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is in the conditional statement where it checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the table is in `stdout`. It seems that the logic for this condition is not implemented correctly, causing incorrect return values.

The reason behind the bug might be the mishandling of the `stdout` variable or the logic of checking if the table exists based on the `stdout` value.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `table_exists` function should be revised. Instead of relying solely on checking if `stdout` is not empty and if the table is in `stdout`, a more robust approach should be adopted. This could involve parsing the output properly and applying the correct conditions to determine if the table exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0}'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split()
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0};show partitions {1}".format(database, table))
        partitions = stdout.split()
        return any(partition.items() <= dict(p.split('=') for p in partition.split('/') if p) for partition in partitions)
```

In this corrected code:
- We retrieve the list of tables in the database and check if the given table is in that list.
- For partitions, we retrieve the list of partitions for the table and then check if the given partition exists in that list. We split the partition and match the key-value pairs to determine if it exists.

This corrected code should address the buggy behavior and pass the test cases without raising `AssertionError`.
