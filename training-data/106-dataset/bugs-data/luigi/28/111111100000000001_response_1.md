Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the else statement of the table_exists function, where it tries to run a hive command with the partition_spec.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to occur because the partition_spec function is being called incorrectly within the else statement of the table_exists function. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the partition_spec function to be a stand-alone function that can be used independently of the HiveCommandClient class.
2. Pass the partition string directly to the HiveCommandClient class instance and modify the table_exists function to utilize the partition_spec method correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)  # call the partition_spec method correctly
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
