The buggy function `table_exists` is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists in the specified database. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. In the `else` block, the Hive command is constructed using `%s` placeholders, but the `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not being properly formatted into the command string.

2. The conditions for returning True or False based on the output of `run_hive_cmd` are not accurate. The function should return True only if the table exists for the given partition, and False if it does not.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

In the modified function:
- We properly format the partition information into the Hive command string in the `else` block using string manipulation.
- We check if the `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists for the given partition, and return True in that case.

This should address the issues and provide the expected behavior for the `table_exists` function.
