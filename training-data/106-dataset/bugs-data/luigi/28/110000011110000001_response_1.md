The test case `test_table_exists` is trying to test the `table_exists` method of the client. It has a number of asserts to verify whether the method behaves correctly for different inputs.

The method `table_exists` in the client has two possible code paths based on whether `partition` is `None` or not. The first path constructs a command using `run_hive_cmd` and then checks if the table exists in the output. The second path constructs a different command using `run_hive_cmd` and then checks if the output is empty.

The error message states that the assert `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails, indicating that the method `table_exists` is returning `False` when it should be returning `True`.

Upon analyzing the method, it seems the bug might be in the second code path, where it is checking if the output is empty. Since the `stdout` is a non-empty string, it always returns `True`, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the second code path so that it properly checks if the `stdout` contains the partitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the modified code, the second code path now checks if the `stdout` has any content and returns `True` if it does, and `False` if it doesn't. This should fix the bug and make the test cases pass.
