The potential error in the `table_exists` function is with the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is called but not defined within the scope of the `table_exists` function. This will result in a NameError when the `table_exists` function is called.

To fix this bug, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be imported or defined within the file where the `table_exists` function is located.

Here's the corrected function with the `run_hive_cmd` function properly defined:

```python
# corrected function
import subprocess

# relative function's signature in this file
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # ... implementation of run_hive_cmd ...

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(partition):
    # ... implementation of partition_spec ...

# relative function's signature in this file
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
