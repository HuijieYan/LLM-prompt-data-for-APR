Potential error location: The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without importing it from its module.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `run_hive_cmd` function is not available in the current file and therefore cannot be used without importing it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the `run_hive_cmd` function from its module so that it can be utilized in the `table_exists` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Add this import statement at the beginning of the file
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# Corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
