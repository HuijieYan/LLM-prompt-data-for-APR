The bug occurs in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The bug lies in the conditional statements where the method returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table or partition in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The specific issues in the buggy code are as follows:
1. In the `if` block, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is used to check if the table exists. However, this condition will return `True` as long as `stdout` is not an empty string, which is incorrect. Instead, the condition should check if the table name is present in the `stdout`.
2. In the `else` block, the condition checks if `stdout` is not empty, which is correct. However, it should return `False` if the partition is not found, rather than returning `True`.

To fix the bug, the conditions in both the `if` and `else` blocks need to be modified.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_condition})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected code ensures that the function correctly checks for the presence of the table and partition in the output and returns the appropriate boolean value.
