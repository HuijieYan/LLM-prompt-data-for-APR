The error in the buggy function `table_exists` seems to be related to the way the `partition_spec` function is being called within the `table_exists` function.

The error message from the test function indicates that the test is failing on the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)`, which suggests that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected result.

Upon further inspection, it appears that the `partition_spec` function is being called incorrectly in the `table_exists` function, which may be causing the issue with the test case failing.

The `partition_spec` function is invoked using `self.partition_spec(partition)`, but if we look at the class declaration, the `partition_spec` function takes `partition` as an argument, not as an attribute of the class. This mismanagement may be leading to incorrect behavior in the `table_exists` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way `partition_spec` is called within the `table_exists` function. We should pass the `partition` argument directly to the `partition_spec` function, as it is not an attribute of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ' AND '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code, we generate the `partition_str` by joining the key-value pairs in the `partition` dictionary and then use it directly in the `run_hive_cmd` function call to get the partitions. We then return the boolean value based on the presence of output in the stdout.
