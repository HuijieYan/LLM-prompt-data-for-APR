1. The error message from the test function indicates that the test is failing because it is expecting the table name to be case insensitive, but the function does not currently handle case sensitivity.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. This is where the case sensitivity issue is likely occurring.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. This causes the test to fail when it expects the function to be case insensitive.

4. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the test failure.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected function, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This makes the comparison case insensitive and addresses the bug in the original function.
