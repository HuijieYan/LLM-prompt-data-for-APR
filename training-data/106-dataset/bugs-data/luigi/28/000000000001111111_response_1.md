The bug in the provided function "table_exists" is that it does not handle the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the database. The function currently checks if the table name exists in the output of the "show tables" or "show partitions" command without considering the case.

The reason for the bug is that Hive is case insensitive, and it returns the table names in lowercase, regardless of their original case. Therefore, when the function compares the provided table name with the output, it does not take into account the case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the provided table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected function, the table name and the output from Hive are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and will work correctly regardless of the case of the table name.
