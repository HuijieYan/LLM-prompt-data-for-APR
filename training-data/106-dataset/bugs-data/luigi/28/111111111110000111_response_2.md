The error message is coming from the test function `test_table_exists`  in the file `hive_test.py`. The error occurs when the function is checking if a table with a different case (uppercase) exists. The test case expects the table to exist, but it fails with the error "AssertionError: False is not true".

The potential error in the `table_exists` function is the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout`. This comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the test to fail when the table name has a different case from the one in the `stdout`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is not case-insensitive. Therefore, when the table name has a different case, it fails to match with the `stdout`, resulting in a false negative.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` should be made case-insensitive. This can be accomplished by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this correction, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the comparison case-insensitive. This modification addresses the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table.
