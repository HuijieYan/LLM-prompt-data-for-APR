The test case `test_table_exists` in the `contrib/hive_test.py` file is failing with the error message `AssertionError: False is not true` when trying to check case insensitivity for table names.

The issue is occurring in the `table_exists` method in the `contrib/hive.py` file. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is case sensitive, and it's causing the test case to fail when checking for a table with a different case.

One approach to fixing this bug is to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive. Another approach could be to use regular expressions to perform a case-insensitive match.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After making this change, the `table_exists` method will be case insensitive when checking for table names, and the test case should pass without any issues.
