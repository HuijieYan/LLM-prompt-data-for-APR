The test function is trying to test the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. In the first test case, it expects the function to return `True` when checking if a table named "MyTable" exists, but it is returning `False` instead. This suggests that there might be a case-sensitivity issue in the comparison.

The potential error location in the `table_exists` method is the comparison of the table name. It seems that the comparison is not case-insensitive, which causes the test to fail when comparing "mytable" with "MyTable".

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison of table names is case-sensitive, causing unexpected behavior when comparing table names with different cases.

To fix the bug, the comparison of table names needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The correction involves converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.
