The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name. This can lead to false negatives when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

Here's the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected code, we are converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` from Hive to lowercase using the `lower()` method for comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue of false negatives when checking for table existence in Hive.
