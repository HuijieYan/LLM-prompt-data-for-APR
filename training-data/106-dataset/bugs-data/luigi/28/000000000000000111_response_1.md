Potential error location: The error may occur in the comparison of the table name to the output from the Hive command, as it is not case insensitive.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lower case before comparing them.

Corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2};'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected code, the table name and the output from the Hive command are both converted to lower case before comparison using the `lower()` method and `map(str.lower, ...)`. This makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub issue.
