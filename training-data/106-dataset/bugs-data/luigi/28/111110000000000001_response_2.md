Potential error location: The bug is likely in the else statement where the `run_hive_cmd` is being called. 

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` is not properly formatted within the else statement. It should be `show partitions table_name partition (partition_spec)` but it is not formatted correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Properly format the `run_hive_cmd` within the else statement to include the table name, partition, and partition_spec.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ""
        for key, value in partition.items():
            partition_str += "{}='{}', ".format(key, value)
        partition_str = partition_str.rstrip(", ")
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
