The potential error location within the function is the use of run_hive_cmd() without any reference to it.

The buggy function is trying to check if a table exists in a given database and partition by running Hive commands, but it contains several issues:

1. The run_hive_cmd() function is being used without being defined or imported, causing the function to fail.

2. The second SQL query in the else clause may not be properly formatted.

To fix the function, we need to define or import the run_hive_cmd() function and ensure that the SQL queries are properly formatted.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return bool(stdout)
```
