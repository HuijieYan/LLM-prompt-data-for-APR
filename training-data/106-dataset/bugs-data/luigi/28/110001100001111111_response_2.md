The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it checks the presence of the table using a case-sensitive comparison. This leads to failures when the table name has a different case than expected. The function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to handle cases where the table name is different in case.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to the table names returned from the Hive command. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison to check for the existence of the table in the Hive database. This will resolve the issues with table names being in different cases.
