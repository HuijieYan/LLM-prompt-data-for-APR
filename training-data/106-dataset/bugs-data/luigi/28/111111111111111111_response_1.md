The error occurs because the `table_exists` function does not make the comparison of table names case insensitive when checking if a table exists. This causes issues when a table name is provided in a different case than stored in the Hive database.

The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where the comparison of table names with the stdout is made without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the comparison of table names with the stdout will be case insensitive, resolving the issue seen in the test cases.
