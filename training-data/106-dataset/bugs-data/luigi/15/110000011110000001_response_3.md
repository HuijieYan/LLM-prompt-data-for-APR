The test case `test_assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses` tests a scheduler's behavior regarding task statuses. The error message indicates that the test is failing when it checks for the statuses 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location in the provided function is the condition that updates `necessary_tasks`. It checks if the task's status is not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or if it has a scheduler_disable_time. The issue is that it only accounts for the status 'DONE' without quotes, which leads to the failure when the test checks for the status 'DONE' with quotes.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check for the statuses as strings rather than variables.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
