Potential error location: The error may be in the condition inside the for loop, where we are checking if the task status is not DONE or DISABLED, or if the task's scheduler_disable_time is not None.

Reason for the bug: The bug may occur because the conditions are not properly checking the task status and the scheduler_disable_time. The logic seems to be incorrect and may not properly filter out the necessary tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the task status is not DONE and not DISABLED, and also check if the task's scheduler_disable_time is not None. This will ensure that only the necessary tasks are included in the set.

2. Use the logical 'or' operator instead of the 'and' operator in the condition.

3. Ensure that the 'get_active_tasks' method is implemented correctly and is returning the expected tasks.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status != DONE and task.status != DISABLED or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
