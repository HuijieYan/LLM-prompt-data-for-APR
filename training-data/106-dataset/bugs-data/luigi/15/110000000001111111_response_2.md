The bug seems to be in the logic of the `get_necessary_tasks` function, where it is not correctly checking the status of the task and the scheduler_disable_time condition. This is causing it to incorrectly update the `necessary_tasks` set.

The bug is likely occurring because the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is incorrectly checking if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED'. However, the task status in the input parameter is 'UNKNOWN', which does not satisfy this condition, causing the code to incorrectly update the `necessary_tasks` set.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to correctly check for the 'UNKNOWN' status as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With this correction, the function should correctly check the task status and update the `necessary_tasks` set accordingly.
