Potential error location within the problematic function:
The `get_necessary_tasks` function is likely the source of the error. The condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` might be the cause of the issue, as it doesn't handle the case in which the status is in lowercase.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `DONE` status might be represented as lowercase in the `task.status`, causing the set comparison in the test case to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for lowercase versions of `DONE`, `DISABLED`, and other status types.
2. Convert the `task.status` to lowercase before the comparison to ensure consistency.

Corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        # Convert task status to lowercase for consistent comparison
        status = task.status.lower() if hasattr(task, 'status') else None
        if status not in ('done', 'disabled') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
