Potential error location: 
The bug is likely in the `get_necessary_tasks` function, which is supposed to retrieve necessary tasks but is not properly considering failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

Reasons behind the bug:
The code does not properly check for failed tasks that are eligible for retry, and it does not handle these tasks accordingly. This leads to assistant workers never retrying failed tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check for failed tasks that are eligible for retry and include them in the set of necessary tasks to be retried.
2. Make sure to properly handle the retry configurations for failed tasks to ensure they are retried by assistant workers.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                (task.status == FAILED and task.retry_count < task.max_retries):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
