The error message indicates that the test case is failing when checking if the set of tasks with status "UNKNOWN" is empty. It seems that the function get_necessary_tasks is not handling the status "UNKNOWN" properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:

```python
self.assertEqual(set([]), set(self.sch.task_list(status, '')))
```

The buggy function get_necessary_tasks is not handling the status "UNKNOWN" properly, which causes the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the get_necessary_tasks function to handle the status "UNKNOWN" correctly and return a set of necessary tasks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
