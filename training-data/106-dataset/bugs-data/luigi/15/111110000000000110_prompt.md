    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Assistant workers never retry failed tasks
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Assistant workers never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

I noticed this with ExternalTasks, but same goes for regular task failures, given the correct retry configurations.
```
