The potential error in the provided function is within the logic of checking for task status and scheduler_disable_time. The bug is likely causing the function to incorrectly determine which tasks are necessary, and could be leading to the assistant workers not retrying failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct logic for determining necessary tasks based on their status and scheduler_disable_time.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) and getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the conditional statement to check for task status not being in (DONE, DISABLED) and the scheduler_disable_time being None, which ensures that necessary tasks are correctly identified.
