Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the for loop where the `get_active_tasks()` method is called.

Reason for the bug: 
1. The `get_active_tasks()` method is called without passing any argument, but the method signature includes a `status` argument. This may cause an error when the method is called without providing the required argument.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass the required `status` argument when calling the `get_active_tasks()` method.
2. If the `status` argument is optional, then ensure that the method can handle the case when the argument is not provided.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks(status=STATUS_IN_PROGRESS):  # Pass a valid status argument
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
