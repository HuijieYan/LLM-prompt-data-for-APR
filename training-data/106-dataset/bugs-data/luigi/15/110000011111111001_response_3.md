The issue within the 'get_necessary_tasks' method could be due to the incorrect comparison for the status of the task. The logic to check whether the status is not in (DONE, DISABLED) is not functioning as expected.

The error message from the test function indicates that the set comparison between the expected set and the actual set failed for the 'unknown' status, which should not have been included in the 'necessary_tasks' set.

To fix this issue, a possible approach would be to explicitly compare the status with the strings 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' instead of using variables. Additionally, it's important to properly handle the situation where the 'scheduler_disable_time' attribute is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_necessary_tasks' method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
