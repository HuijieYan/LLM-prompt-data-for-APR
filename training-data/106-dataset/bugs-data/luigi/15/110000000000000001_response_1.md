Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the usage of `DONE` and `DISABLED`, which are undefined. They likely should be attributes of the `task` objects, but they are being used without proper definition.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The code is trying to check the status of a task using `DONE` and `DISABLED`, which are not defined within the function. Additionally, the `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None)` is not checking for the status of the task correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define `DONE` and `DISABLED` status for the tasks.
2. Check the task's status using the correct attributes or methods.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status != 'DONE' and task.status != 'DISABLED' or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
