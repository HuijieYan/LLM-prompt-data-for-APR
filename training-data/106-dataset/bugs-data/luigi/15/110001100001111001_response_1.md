Potential error location: The code may fail to correctly add the task dependencies and the task id to the necessary_tasks set.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not properly updating the necessary_tasks set with the task dependencies and task id.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to update the code to correctly add the task dependencies and task id to the necessary_tasks set.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)  # Change the updating logic here
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)        # Change the updating logic here
    return necessary_tasks
```
