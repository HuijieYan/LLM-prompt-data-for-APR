The buggy function `get_necessary_tasks` is attempting to retrieve active tasks and check their status. However, the `get_active_tasks` function is not implemented correctly, and it seems that the `update` function is also not implemented in a way compatible with the `get_active_tasks` function.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the `get_active_tasks` function is correctly implemented and that the `update` function is also compatible with it. Once those functions are fixed, the `get_necessary_tasks` function should work correctly.

Here's a corrected implementation for the functions:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_15/luigi/scheduler.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, worker_reference, get_work=False):
    # ... updated code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
    # ... updated code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, worker_id, worker_reference=None, get_work=False):
    # ... updated code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... updated code ...
        pass

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```

By implementing the correct versions of `get_active_tasks` and `update` functions, the `get_necessary_tasks` function should work as expected without the previous issues.
