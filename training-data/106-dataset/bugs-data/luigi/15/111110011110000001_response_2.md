The error message indicates that the `sch.task_list` method returned an unexpected value for the 'unknown' status, causing the test to fail.

In the `get_necessary_tasks` method, the loop iterates over the tasks returned by the `get_active_tasks` method. The bug occurs when checking the status of each task using `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. 

The potential error location can be identified as the way the status of the task is being checked. The method is looking for task statuses using uppercase identifiers (e.g., 'DONE', 'DISABLED'), but the test case uses lowercase status identifiers (e.g., 'done', 'disabled'). This mismatch in the status check results in the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the method should use lowercase status identifiers to align with the test case. Additionally, for the task status 'DISABLED', the method should check for 'pending', as the test case uses 'pending' for this status.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.lower() not in ('done', 'disabled') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
