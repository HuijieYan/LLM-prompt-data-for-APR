Potential error location:
The issue is likely within the `get_necessary_tasks` function, where it is not correctly identifying tasks that are eligible for retry.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_necessary_tasks` function is not properly identifying tasks that are eligible for retry. It is not taking into account the task status and retry configurations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check for the task's retry configuration to determine if it is eligible for retry.
2. Consider the task status to determine if it is eligible for retry.
3. Ensure that the function properly identifies tasks that are eligible for retry based on their configurations and status.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                (getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None and getattr(task, 'retry_config', None) is not None and task.retry_config.attempt_count < task.max_attempts):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
