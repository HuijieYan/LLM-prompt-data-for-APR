The bug originates from the 'get_necessary_tasks' function, where it is incorrectly adding tasks with status 'DONE', 'DISABLED' and tasks with 'scheduler_disable_time' attribute set to something other than None to the set of necessary tasks. This addition is erroneous, as tasks with these statuses are considered completed or disabled, and should not be marked as necessary. The 'get_necessary_tasks' function is expected to return a set of tasks that are considered necessary for further processing, which excludes tasks with these statuses.

To fix this bug, a condition should be added to exclude tasks with statuses 'DONE', 'DISABLED' and a non-None 'scheduler_disable_time' attribute from being added to the 'necessary_tasks' set.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_necessary_tasks' function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') and getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

This will ensure that only tasks that are neither 'DONE' nor 'DISABLED' and do not have 'scheduler_disable_time' set will be added to the 'necessary_tasks' set.
