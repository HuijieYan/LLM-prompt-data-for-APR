Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `get_necessary_tasks` function, where it is not correctly identifying the tasks that are eligible for retry.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the logic inside the function is not correctly identifying tasks that are eligible for retry. It is not checking for a 'failed' status and is not applying the correct retry configurations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the 'failed' status of the task.
2. Apply the correct retry configurations based on the task's status and retry settings.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status == 'failed' and task.retry_policy is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
