The potential error in the code lies in the condition inside the for loop. It is checking if the task status is not in (DONE, DISABLED) or if the task has a scheduler_disable_time. However, it should be checking for the task status as well as the scheduler_disable_time for the task.

The bug occurs because the current condition only checks if either the task status is not in (DONE, DISABLED) or if the task has a scheduler_disable_time. This means that a task with status 'UNKNOWN' will always pass the condition regardless of the scheduler_disable_time, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the for loop to check both the task status and the scheduler_disable_time.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if (task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)) and (getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
