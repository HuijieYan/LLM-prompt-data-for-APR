Potential Error Location:
The `get_necessary_tasks` method within the `SimpleTaskState` class is the likely source of the bug.

Reasons for Bug Occurrence:
The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect comparisons in the `get_necessary_tasks` method. The code attempts to check whether the status of a task is not in (DONE, DISABLED) and whether the attribute `scheduler_disable_time` is not None. However, it does not consider the fact that the 'task' may not have a 'status' attribute, which can lead to attribute errors. Additionally, the 'task.deps' and 'task.id' attributes might not exist, causing further issues.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add checks to ensure that the required attributes (e.g., 'status', 'deps', 'id') exist before accessing them.
2. Use try-except blocks to handle potential attribute errors gracefully.
3. Check for the existence of the relevant attributes before performing comparisons or operations on them.

Corrected Code:
```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # this is the corrected function

        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if hasattr(task, 'status') and task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                    (hasattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time') and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None):
                if hasattr(task, 'deps'):
                    necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                if hasattr(task, 'id'):
                    necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
