It seems that the issue is related to the `get_necessary_tasks` function within the `SimpleTaskState` class. The function is not correctly identifying necessary tasks, as it is not properly checking for the status of tasks and their dependencies.

The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. The variable `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined in the given code, so the condition will not work as intended.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly checking the status of tasks and their dependencies, which leads to incorrect identification of necessary tasks.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `DONE` and `DISABLED` statuses, which are likely used in the condition. Additionally, we need to check the status of tasks and their dependencies properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we have defined the statuses 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' as strings in the condition. This should ensure that the function properly identifies necessary tasks based on their status and dependencies.
