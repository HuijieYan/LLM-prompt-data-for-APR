Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` because the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined within the function.

Reason for the bug: The bug is happening because the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined within the function, causing a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` or import them from a module where they are defined.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    DONE = "done"  # example value
    DISABLED = "disabled"  # example value
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
