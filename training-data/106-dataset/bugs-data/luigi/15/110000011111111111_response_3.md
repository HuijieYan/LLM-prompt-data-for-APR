The error occurs in the `get_necessary_tasks` function. This function is supposed to return a set of necessary tasks, but the current implementation does not handle the task status conditions correctly. The condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` is causing the bug.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly excluding the 'unknown' status task, as seen in the test case. The `get_necessary_tasks` function should include tasks with the 'unknown' status because they are still necessary. Moreover, the function should not exclude tasks with the 'DONE' status.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to only exclude tasks with the 'DISABLED' status:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status != DISABLED or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

By modifying the condition to exclude only 'DISABLED' tasks, the corrected function will now include tasks with the 'DONE', 'UNKNOWN', and 'FAILED' statuses, as they are necessary for the scheduler to handle.

This change will address the issue raised in the test case and fix the bug related to the assistant workers never retrying failed tasks.
