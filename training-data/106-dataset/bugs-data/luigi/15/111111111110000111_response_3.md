1. The test case "assistants_dont_nurture_finished_statuses" is checking whether certain statuses are nurtured by the assistant worker. It then verifies whether certain tasks are in the task list for the specified statuses. The error message indicates that the set comparison for the "unknown" status failed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to determine if a task should be added to the necessary tasks set. This logic is present in the "get_necessary_tasks" method.

3. The occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect logic in determining which tasks are considered necessary. This results in tasks with the "unknown" status being incorrectly added to the set of necessary tasks, causing the test to fail.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for determining the necessary tasks needs to be revised to correctly exclude tasks with the "unknown" status, as indicated by the test case.

5. Below is the corrected code for the "get_necessary_tasks" method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)

    # Exclude tasks with the 'unknown' status
    necessary_tasks = {task_id for task_id in necessary_tasks if task_id.status != 'UNKNOWN'}

    return necessary_tasks
```
