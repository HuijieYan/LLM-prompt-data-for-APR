The error message indicates that the test is failing at the `self.assertEqual(set([]), set(self.sch.task_list(status, '')))` line because the second set has an item 'unknown' which is not present in the first set. This means that the `get_necessary_tasks` method is not excluding tasks with status 'UNKNOWN' from the `necessary_tasks` set.

The potential error location within the `get_necessary_tasks` method is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. It should be checking for the uppercase string values 'DONE' and 'DISABLED'.

The bug occurs because the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is not correctly checking for the 'DONE' and 'DISABLED' statuses. Additionally, the condition `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` is not correctly excluding tasks with status 'DISABLED'.

To fix the bug, both the conditions need to be modified to properly handle the status checks and exclude 'UNKNOWN' status.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.upper() not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
