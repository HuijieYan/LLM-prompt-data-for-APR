The error in the code is occurring in the `get_necessary_tasks` method of the `SimpleTaskState` class. The issue seems to lie with the line:
```
if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
```
This is likely causing unexpected behavior and leading to the error in the test case regarding the statuses being nurtured or not.

The potential error location is the condition in the if statement. The status constants `DONE` and `DISABLED` are not defined within the `get_necessary_tasks` method or imported from an external source, which would cause a NameError. It seems they should be defined as strings within the function and compared to `task.status` as strings.

To fix this bug, the `DONE` and `DISABLED` values should be defined as strings and compared to the `task.status` attribute as strings. The corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` method is as follows:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.lower() not in ('done', 'disabled') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With these changes, the `DONE` and `DISABLED` constants are replaced with the strings 'done' and 'disabled', and the comparison with `task.status` is done as a string comparison. This should resolve the bug and prevent the error in the test case.
