The error message indicates that the test is failing due to the 'unknown' status not being present in the set of 'not_nurtured_statuses', as expected.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)`. This condition might not be handling the 'UNKNOWN' status correctly, leading to the failure in the test case.

The bug occurs because the 'UNKNOWN' status is not being considered explicitly in the condition mentioned above. As a result, the 'UNKNOWN' status is not being treated as a not nurtured status, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to include the 'UNKNOWN' status.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the updated condition:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
