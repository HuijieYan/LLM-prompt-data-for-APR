The error message indicates that the test is failing because the set comparison between the expected and actual task statuses is not producing the desired result. Specifically, the status 'UNKNOWN' is present in the second set but not in the first, causing the assertion error.

Upon analyzing the function `get_necessary_tasks`, the potential error location is identified in the following line:
```python
if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
        getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
```
The bug occurs because the status constants `DONE` and `DISABLED` are being referenced directly without being properly defined or imported.

To fix the bug, the status constants `DONE` and `DISABLED` need to be imported from their respective module or defined within the class if they are not external dependencies.

Corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:
```python
# import or define the status constants DONE and DISABLED
DONE = 'DONE'
DISABLED = 'DISABLED'

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
