The error message indicates that the task with status 'unknown' is not being considered a necessary task, which is incorrect. This suggests that the bug is likely within the `get_necessary_tasks` function which is not correctly including tasks with a status of 'unknown' in the necessary tasks set. This is likely due to the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` excluding the 'unknown' status.

To fix this bug, the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` should be modified to include the 'UNKNOWN' status as well. Also, the task with `status == 'UNKNOWN'` should be added to the `necessary_tasks` set.

The corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
