The error occurs because the `get_necessary_tasks` function is not correctly identifying the necessary tasks. It is not including tasks with status `DONE` or `DISABLED`, which are actually necessary. The function is also not correctly parsing the status of tasks and adding the necessary tasks to the set.

To fix the bug, the function should consider tasks with status `DONE` and `DISABLED` as necessary. Additionally, it should correctly parse the status of tasks and add the necessary tasks to the set.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status.upper() not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With these modifications, the `get_necessary_tasks` function should correctly identify the necessary tasks and address the bug associated with assistant workers never retrying failed tasks.
