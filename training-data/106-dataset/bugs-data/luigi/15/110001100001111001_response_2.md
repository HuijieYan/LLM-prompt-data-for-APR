The problem with the `get_necessary_tasks` function is that it is not correctly identifying the necessary tasks based on their status and disable time. It is also not properly updating the set of necessary tasks.

The code is currently checking if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', however, the actual status values are 'UNKNOWN', 'PENDING', 'RUNNING', and 'FAILED'. Additionally, the comparison with 'GET_WORK' and checking for the existence of 'scheduler_disable_time' is not relevant to the task status.

To fix this, the function should check for the correct status values ('DONE' and 'DISABLED'), and then update the necessary_tasks set with the task dependencies and task id.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED'):
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
