The error occurs in the `get_necessary_tasks` method. 

The issue arises from the code block:
```python
if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
        getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
    necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
    necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
```
Here, the condition checks if the status of a task is not DONE or DISABLED, or if the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute of the task is not None. If any of these conditions are met, the task dependencies and the task ID are added to the `necessary_tasks` set.

Looking at the test case, the buggy function is expected to return all statuses including 'unknown', 'pending', 'running', and 'failed' since the task is in the 'UNKNOWN' status and it does not belong to the 'done' or 'disabled' statuses. However, in the buggy implementation, the 'unknown' status is not included in the `necessary_tasks` set, resulting in the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed so that the task status 'UNKNOWN' is also included in the `necessary_tasks` set. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'UNKNOWN') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
