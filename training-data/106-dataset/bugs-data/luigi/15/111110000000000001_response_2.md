Potential error location: 
The error may occur in the line where the condition `task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is checked. This is because `DONE` and `DISABLED` are being referenced as variables instead of strings or constants.

Reason for the bug:
The `DONE` and `DISABLED` variables are not defined anywhere within the provided code, which will result in a NameError when the function is executed.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `DONE` and `DISABLED` as constants within the class or globally, as per the context in which they are used.
2. Alternatively, replace `DONE` and `DISABLED` with string literals representing the status values directly.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.

        for task in self.get_active_tasks():

                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
