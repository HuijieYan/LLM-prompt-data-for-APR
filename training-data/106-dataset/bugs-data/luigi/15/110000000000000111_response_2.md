Potential error location: The condition in the if statement seems to be incorrect and may not capture the intended logic accurately.

Reasons behind the bug: The condition in the if statement may not be capturing the necessary logic for identifying tasks that are eligible for retry.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the condition in the if statement to accurately capture tasks that are eligible for retry.
2. Check the retry configurations for failed tasks and ensure that they are being considered in the logic.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) and \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
