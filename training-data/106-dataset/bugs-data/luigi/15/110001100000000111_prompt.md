# Buggy function source code

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Assistant workers never retry failed tasks
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Assistant workers never retry failed tasks that are eligible for retry.

I noticed this with ExternalTasks, but same goes for regular task failures, given the correct retry configurations.
```
