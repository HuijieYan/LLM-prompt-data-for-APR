Potential error locations within the problematic function:
- The condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` may not be correctly excluding the statuses DONE and DISABLED, leading to the set `necessary_tasks` being updated incorrectly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The bug likely occurs because the condition `(task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None)` is not handling the statuses properly, which results in incorrect updating of `necessary_tasks`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to correctly handle the exclusion of statuses DONE and DISABLED.
2. Use a different approach to update the `necessary_tasks` set based on the task's status.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED'):
            if getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
