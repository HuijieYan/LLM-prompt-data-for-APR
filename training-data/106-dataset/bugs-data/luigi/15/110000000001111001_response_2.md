The bug in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is that it is not correctly checking the status of the task. 

The condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:` is intended to determine if the task status is neither DONE nor DISABLED, or if the task has a `scheduler_disable_time` attribute. However, this condition does not accurately capture the intended logic. 

The bug occurs because the set of active tasks (`self.get_active_tasks()`) is not being properly filtered based on the task status.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly filter out tasks that are either DONE or DISABLED, or have a `scheduler_disable_time` attribute. This can be achieved by using the logical operator `and` to properly combine the conditions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) and getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, we use the `and` operator instead of `or` to properly combine the conditions and ensure that the task's status is neither DONE nor DISABLED, and that the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute is not present. This should provide the expected behavior as specified in the test case.
