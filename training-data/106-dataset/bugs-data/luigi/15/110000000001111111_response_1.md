The buggy function `get_necessary_tasks` seems to be incorrectly updating the `necessary_tasks` set.

The issue seems to be with the condition `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None`, which is not accurately checking if the task status is 'DONE' or 'DISABLED'. Additionally, the condition for updating `necessary_tasks` with dependencies and task id seems to be incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check for the task status using the correct attribute. We also need to properly update `necessary_tasks` with the task dependencies and task id.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status != 'DONE' and task.status != 'DISABLED' or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

This corrected code includes the correct condition for checking the task status and updates `necessary_tasks` as per the expected behavior.
