The potential error in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is due to the fact that `task.status` is being compared to the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` without them being defined. Additionally, the comparison `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None)` is not being compared to any value.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `DONE` and `DISABLED` are defined constants or strings and that the comparison for `scheduler_disable_time` is complete.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to define `DONE` and `DISABLED` as constants at the beginning of the class, and modify the comparison for `scheduler_disable_time` to check if it's not equal to `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    DONE = 'DONE'
    DISABLED = 'DISABLED'

    def get_active_tasks(self, status=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (self.DONE, self.DISABLED) or task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```
