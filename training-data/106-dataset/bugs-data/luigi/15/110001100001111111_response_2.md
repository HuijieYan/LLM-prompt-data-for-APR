The bug in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is likely due to the incorrect comparison of task status and the incorrect usage of task attributes.

The function is intended to return a set of necessary tasks based on their status and dependencies. However, the comparison `if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED)` is likely incorrect as it doesn't seem to properly handle the task status. Additionally, the comparison `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` is likely incorrect as well, as it's not clear how the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute should affect the task's necessity.

To fix the bug, we need to fix the conditions for checking the task status and properly handle the task's attributes to determine its necessity.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('PENDING', 'FAILED', 'RUNNING') or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code:
- The comparison `(DONE, DISABLED)` is replaced with `('PENDING', 'FAILED', 'RUNNING')` to properly handle the task status.
- The comparison `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None` is kept as is, assuming that it's correctly handling the task's necessity based on `scheduler_disable_time`.

Please review and verify the corrected code in the context of your specific use case to ensure it meets your requirements.
