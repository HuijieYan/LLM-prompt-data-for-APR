The error in the `get_necessary_tasks` function is that it is not correctly identifying the necessary tasks. The function should add the task dependencies and the task itself to the `necessary_tasks` set only if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', or if the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute is not None.

The potential error lies in the conditional statement checking the task status and the `scheduler_disable_time`.

The bug occurs because the current conditional statement is checking for the task status using variables `DONE` and `DISABLED`, but these variables are not defined within the function. Additionally, the `task.status` is being compared to these undefined variables, possibly resulting in a TypeError. 

To fix the bug, the variables `DONE` and `DISABLED` should be imported or defined within the function, and the conditional statement should be updated to check for `task.status in ('DONE', 'DISABLED')`. Also, `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None)` should be replaced with `getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    DONE = 'DONE'
    DISABLED = 'DISABLED'
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status in (DONE, DISABLED) or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
