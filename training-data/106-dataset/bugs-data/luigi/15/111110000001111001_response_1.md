The issue with the provided function is that it's trying to access the 'status' attribute of the task object directly, but the task object itself does not have a 'status' attribute. This is why it's resulting in an error when trying to run the function.

To fix this issue, we need to access the 'status' attribute of the task object using the correct syntax. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task['status'] not in (DONE, DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task['deps'])
            necessary_tasks.add(task['id'])
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we're assuming that the task object is a dictionary (based on the provided variable values and types). Therefore, we're accessing the 'status', 'deps', and 'id' attributes using the correct dictionary syntax.
