The potential error in the provided function is in the loop where it iterates over the active tasks to check their status. The conditional statement inside the loop is not correctly checking the task status.

The reason behind the bug is that the conditional statement is not checking the task status properly. It is also not handling the case where the status might be `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check the task status and handle the case where the status might be `None`. Additionally, we need to make sure that the status constants (DONE, DISABLED) are properly defined and accessible inside the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (Task.DONE, Task.DISABLED) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            if task.deps:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

In this corrected code, we properly check the task status using `Task.DONE` and `Task.DISABLED` constants. We also handle the case where `task.deps` might be empty and the status might be `None`.
