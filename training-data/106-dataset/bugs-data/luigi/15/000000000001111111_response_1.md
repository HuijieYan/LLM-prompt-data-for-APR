The potential error location is in the conditional statement within the for loop in the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The condition is checking whether the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', but the status of the task is 'UNKNOWN', which does not satisfy the condition. This causes the task to not be added to the `necessary_tasks` set, leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to include the 'UNKNOWN' status as well. This will ensure that tasks with status 'UNKNOWN' will also be considered necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, 'UNKNOWN') or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With this change, tasks with the 'UNKNOWN' status will now be included in the `necessary_tasks` set, and the bug should be fixed.
