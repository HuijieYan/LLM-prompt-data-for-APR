The error occurs because the `if` condition in the `get_necessary_tasks` method is not handling the status values correctly. The condition checks if the task status is not 'DONE' or 'DISABLED', but it should also be checking for the status 'FAILED'. Additionally, the condition to check for `scheduler_disable_time` should be in the `if` condition and not in the outer loop.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to include the 'FAILED' status and move the check for `scheduler_disable_time` inside the `if` condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` method:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in ('DONE', 'DISABLED', 'FAILED') and getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

With this correction, the `get_necessary_tasks` method should now correctly handle the task statuses and return the expected set of necessary tasks.
