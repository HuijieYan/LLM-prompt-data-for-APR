The error occurs because the function `get_necessary_tasks` is not correctly handling the task statuses. The function is supposed to return a set of necessary tasks, but it is not filtering out DONE and DISABLED tasks.

The bug in the function `get_necessary_tasks` is that it is not correctly checking for the task statuses and the existence of the 'scheduler_disable_time' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check for the task statuses and the 'scheduler_disable_time' attribute. We also need to update the necessary_tasks set by adding task.deps and task.id if the conditions are met.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in [DONE, DISABLED] or getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(set(task.deps))
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

By using square brackets `[]` instead of parentheses `()`, we ensure that the condition is correctly evaluated. Additionally, we are properly updating the necessary_tasks set by adding the dependencies and task id if the conditions are met.
