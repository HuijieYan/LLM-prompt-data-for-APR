Potential error location: The 'get_active_tasks' method is called incorrectly within the 'get_necessary_tasks' method, and there are multiple 'update' methods defined in the same class, which may lead to confusion.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The 'get_active_tasks' method is called without passing the 'status' argument, which may result in unexpected behavior.
2. The use of multiple 'update' methods with different signatures can lead to confusion and potential errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the 'get_active_tasks' method is called with the appropriate 'status' argument to filter tasks based on their status.
2. Rename the 'update' method with different signatures to avoid confusion and potential errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
