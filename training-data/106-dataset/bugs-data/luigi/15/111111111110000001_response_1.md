The error message indicates that the test is failing because the 'unknown' status is present in the second set, returned by calling `self.sch.task_list(status, '')`, but not in the first set in the `for` loop iteration for `not_nurtured_statuses`.

The potential error location is within the `get_necessary_tasks` function. The issue seems to be related to how it handles the 'UNKNOWN' status. This is likely why 'unknown' is present in the second set but not in the first set.

The bug occurs because the 'UNKNOWN' status is not being handled correctly within the `get_necessary_tasks` function when it checks for necessary tasks based on status.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `get_necessary_tasks` function to correctly handle the 'UNKNOWN' status.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_necessary_tasks` function:

```python
    def get_necessary_tasks(self):
        necessary_tasks = set()
        for task in self.get_active_tasks():
            if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                    getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
                necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
                necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
        return necessary_tasks
```

In the corrected code, 'UNKNOWN' status is explicitly included in the condition to check for necessary tasks. This should ensure that the 'unknown' status flag is correctly handled and the issue identified in the test case should be resolved.
