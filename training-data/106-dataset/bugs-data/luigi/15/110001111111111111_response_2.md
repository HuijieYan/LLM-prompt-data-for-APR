The error occurs when the "get_necessary_tasks" function is called within the test case. The function is supposed to gather the necessary tasks based on their status, but it fails to collect all the required tasks as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition inside the for loop where it checks for the task status. It properly filters out the "DONE" and "DISABLED" statuses, but it fails to add the "UNKNOWN" status tasks to the necessary_tasks set.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "UNKNOWN" status tasks are not being considered as necessary tasks, even though they should be included based on the provided scenario in the test case.

To fix the bug, the condition inside the for loop in the "get_necessary_tasks" function should be updated to include "UNKNOWN" status tasks as necessary tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected get_necessary_tasks function
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DONE, DISABLED, UNKNOWN) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```

By including "UNKNOWN" status tasks in the condition, the function will now correctly gather all the necessary tasks based on their status.
