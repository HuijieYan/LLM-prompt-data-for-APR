Potential error location: The if condition inside the for loop in the get_necessary_tasks function is likely causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The if condition inside the for loop is checking for the status of the task, but the status values (DONE and DISABLED) are not defined anywhere in the code. Additionally, the getattr function is used to fetch the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute from the task object, but it is not clear if this attribute exists in the task object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the status values (DONE and DISABLED) if they are not already defined in the code.
2. Check for the existence of the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute in the task object before using the getattr function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_necessary_tasks(self):
    necessary_tasks = set()
    for task in self.get_active_tasks():
        if task.status not in (DEFINED_STATUS, ANOTHER_DEFINED_STATUS) or \
                getattr(task, 'scheduler_disable_time', None) is not None:
            necessary_tasks.update(task.deps)
            necessary_tasks.add(task.id)
    return necessary_tasks
```
In the corrected code:
- DEFINED_STATUS and ANOTHER_DEFINED_STATUS should be replaced with the appropriate status values defined in the code.
- The `scheduler_disable_time` attribute is accessed using the getattr function with a default value of None to avoid potential attribute errors.
