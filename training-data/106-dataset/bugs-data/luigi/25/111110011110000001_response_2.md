The error occurs in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. Specifically, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` is causing a `TypeError` because it is attempting to call a string object as a function.

The reason behind this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is intended to be a method, but it is incorrectly defined as a string. This causes the error when the `run` method tries to call `self.s3_load_path()`.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute needs to be defined as a method to ensure it can be called within the `run` method without causing a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    # ... other methods ...

    def s3_load_path(self):
        # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
        
        path = self.s3_load_path()
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
        
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
        
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```
