The error message indicates that the `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` occurred at line 166 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. This error suggests that the attribute `s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable function, but it's actually a string.

The issue is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is not being defined as a method, but rather a variable. This means that when it is called within the `run` method, it is being treated as a callable function, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this issue, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be defined as a method by adding the appropriate method definition.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable` class with the `s3_load_path` attribute defined as a method:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def s3_load_path(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # ... other relative functions ...

    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path()  # Corrected method call
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By defining `s3_load_path` as a method within the `S3CopyToTable` class, the TypeError issue should be resolved.
