The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because a string object is being called as a function. This occurs at line 166 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, specifically within the `run` method, when `self.s3_load_path` is called as a function.

The most probable reason for this bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method or function, but it is actually a string. This could be due to a mistake in the assignment or initialization of `self.s3_load_path`.

To fix this bug, the assignment or initialization of `self.s3_load_path` should be checked and modified if necessary to ensure that it is an actual function or method rather than a string.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    # Assuming self.s3_load_path is supposed to be a function
    path = self.s3_load_path()  # Call the function to get the path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In the corrected code, `self.s3_load_path()` is treated as a function, and its return value is assigned to the `path` variable. This assumes that `self.s3_load_path` is indeed supposed to be a function for obtaining the file path. If it is intended to be a string instead, the usage of `self.s3_load_path()` as a function should be replaced with the actual string value.
