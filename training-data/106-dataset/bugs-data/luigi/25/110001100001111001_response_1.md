The potential error in the code is that the `run` function is trying to call methods such as `self.s3_load_path()`, `self.output().connect()`, `self.does_table_exist(connection)`, `self.create_table(connection)`, `self.do_truncate_table()`, `self.truncate_table(connection)`, `self.init_copy(connection)`, `self.copy(cursor, path)`, `self.output().touch(connection)`, `connection.cursor()`, `connection.commit()`, and `connection.close()`. However, these methods are not defined or implemented in the provided code, resulting in a NameError or AttributeError when the code tries to call them.

The approach to fixing this issue would be to define and implement these methods within the class `DummyS3CopyToTable` so that they can be called within the `run` function without causing any errors.

Below is the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.create_connection()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.touch_output(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In this corrected code, I have assumed that the methods for creating a connection (`self.create_connection()`) and touching the output (`self.touch_output(connection)`) are defined and implemented within the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class. I have also removed the extra instances of `self.copy` and `self.output` that were defined in the original code since they were duplicated.
