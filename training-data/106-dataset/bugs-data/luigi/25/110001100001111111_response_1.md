The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` indicates that the `s3_load_path` attribute of the class `S3CopyToTable` is being treated as a string and being called as a function, which is not possible.

The reason for this bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a parameter (`luigi.Parameter()`) but is inadvertently being called as a function.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` should be accessed as an attribute (not called as a function) by removing the parentheses.

Below is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Fix: removed parentheses
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `s3_load_path` attribute will be correctly accessed without causing a `TypeError`.
