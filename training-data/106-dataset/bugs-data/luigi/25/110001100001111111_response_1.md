The error is occurring at `path = self.s3_load_path()`, where `self.s3_load_path` is being called as if it were a method, but it is actually a string. This is clear from the error message `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`.

The issue is that `s3_load_path` is defined as a parameter in the `MyRedshiftTask` class, and it should be accessed directly as an attribute rather than as a method.

To fix this bug, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` should be changed to `path = self.s3_load_path` without the parentheses.

```python
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path  # Fix: Changed from self.s3_load_path() to self.s3_load_path
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```
