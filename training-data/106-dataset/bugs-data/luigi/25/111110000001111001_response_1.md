The potential error location within the `run` function is around the `self.create_table(connection)` line. If the table doesn't exist, the `create_table` function is called, but there is no validation for successful table creation. 

The error message "table need to be specified" is from the line `if not (self.table): raise Exception("table need to be specified")`, but this check seems unnecessary as the variable `self.table` is already used in the subsequent code without any issues. 

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to include proper validation for table existence and creation. Additionally, the unnecessary table check should be removed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run(self):
    # Accessing the table value directly without a check as it's necessary for the subsequent process
    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    
    # Validate if the table exists
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)

    # Truncate table if required
    if self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

In the corrected code, instead of checking for the existence of `self.table`, we proceed directly with the table name assuming it is necessary. We then validate if the table exists and create it if it doesn't. If truncating the table is required, it is done after the table existence check.
