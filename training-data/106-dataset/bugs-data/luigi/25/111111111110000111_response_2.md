The error is occurring when the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class attempts to call `self.s3_load_path()`.

The error message `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` indicates that `self.s3_load_path` is a string, and the code is trying to call it as a function, which is not possible. This indicates that there is a mismatch in the usage of `s3_load_path` as a property and a function.

To fix this bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be set to a value, and the `run` method should use it directly without calling it as a function.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")
    
    path = self.s3_load_path  # Access the attribute directly without calling it as a function
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()
    
    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making the change to `path = self.s3_load_path`, the code will now access the `s3_load_path` attribute directly without trying to call it as a function, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
