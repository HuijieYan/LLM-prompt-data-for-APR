Potential error location: 

The error occurs when the `self.s3_load_path()` method is called. It seems that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method, but it is actually a string attribute. This is causing the TypeError: 'str' object is not callable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The error is occurring because the `self.s3_load_path` attribute is being mistakenly called as a method, resulting in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, the `self.s3_load_path` attribute should be accessed directly without trying to call it as a method. It appears that it may have been intended to be a string attribute that holds the file path, rather than a method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    # Use the s3_load_path attribute directly
    path = self.s3_load_path  # removed () as it is not a method

    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
