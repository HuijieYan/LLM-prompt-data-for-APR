The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a function, but it is actually a string.

The bug occurs because the `s3_load_path` attribute is being called as a function (`self.s3_load_path()`), but it is actually defined as a parameter in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The correct way to access the value of `s3_load_path` is just by using `self.s3_load_path` instead of `self.s3_load_path()`.

To fix the bug, you need to change the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` to `path = self.s3_load_path` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not self.table:
            raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

        path = self.s3_load_path
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)

        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()

        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```
