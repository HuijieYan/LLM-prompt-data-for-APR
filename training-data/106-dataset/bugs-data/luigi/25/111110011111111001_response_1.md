The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`, which suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable function (method) when it is actually a string.

The bug is likely happening because `s3_load_path` is incorrectly defined as a method in the `S3CopyToTable` class. The method `s3_load_path` should instead be an attribute (variable) that holds the path to the s3 load location. 

To fix the bug:
1. Change the method `s3_load_path` to an attribute `s3_load_path` that holds the path to the S3 load location.
2. Remove any reference to `self.s3_load_path()` from within the `run` method and use the `s3_load_path` attribute directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # attribute to hold the S3 load path
    s3_load_path = 's3://bucket/key'
    
    # ... other relative methods ...


    # corrected run method
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By making the fixes above, the `TypeError` should no longer occur, and the code should function as intended.
