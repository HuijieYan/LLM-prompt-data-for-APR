The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` with the message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable". This error suggests that `self.s3_load_path` is a string, and the code is trying to call it as a function.

The reason behind this bug is that `s3_load_path` is defined as a function within the class, but it's being accessed as a attribute. The variable must be accessed as `self.s3_load_path` within the class.

To fix this bug, the correct code for the `run` method should look like this:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()  # accessing the method correctly
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
