The error occurs within the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class. Specifically, the line causing the error is `path = self.s3_load_path()`. The error message indicates that a `'str' object is not callable`, which implies that the `s3_load_path` attribute is being treated as a function when it is actually a string.

The issue is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a string in the class, but in the `run` method, it is mistakenly being called as a method. This has led to the TypeError being raised.

To fix the bug, the `s3_load_path` attribute should be defined as a string, and the `run` method should simply access its value without trying to execute it as a function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", self.s3_load_path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, self.s3_load_path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

This corrected code removes the erroneous call to `self.s3_load_path()` and directly uses `self.s3_load_path` as a string value.
