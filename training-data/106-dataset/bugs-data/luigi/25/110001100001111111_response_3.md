The error occurred in this part of the code:
```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```
The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" indicates that the variable `self.s3_load_path` is a string and not a callable function, yet it is being called as a function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.s3_load_path` attribute is assigned a string value instead of a function, and then it's being invoked as a function.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the `self.s3_load_path` attribute is assigned the correct function reference instead of a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    # Correcting the attribute assignment here
    path = self.s3_load_path  # Removed the () after self.s3_load_path

    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
