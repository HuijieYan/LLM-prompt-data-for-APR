The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" suggests that the issue is with calling a string as a function. In this case, the problem is likely with the `self.s3_load_path()` call.

The reason behind the bug is that `self.s3_load_path` is not a method but rather a property of the class. Therefore, trying to call it as a method with `self.s3_load_path()` results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `self.s3_load_path()` call should be replaced with simply `self.s3_load_path`. This will correctly access the property without trying to call it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def run(self):
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
