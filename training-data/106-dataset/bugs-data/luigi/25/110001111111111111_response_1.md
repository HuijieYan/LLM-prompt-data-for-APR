The error occurs on the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable, suggesting that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a callable object when it is actually a string.

The reason behind the bug is that the `s3_load_path` attribute is defined as a parameter in the `DummyS3CopyToTable` class, but it is being treated as a method within the `run` method, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the reference to `self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method should be changed to `self.s3_load_path`, indicating that it is an attribute access rather than a method call.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the TypeError should be resolved, and the `run` method should function as intended.
