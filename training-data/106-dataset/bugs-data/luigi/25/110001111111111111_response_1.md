The error occurred at `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that a 'str' object is not callable, which means that `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a function/method, but it is actually a string.

This bug occurred because `self.s3_load_path` was defined as a class attribute (`s3_load_path = luigi.Parameter()`), and it was then referenced as a method (`self.s3_load_path()`). The correct way to reference a class attribute is without the parentheses.

To fix this bug, you should remove the parentheses from `self.s3_load_path` so that it is accessed as an attribute rather than as a method.

Here's the corrected `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()

    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the `run` method should work as expected when called.
