The error "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" occurred when the function `s3_load_path` was being called as a method with parentheses `()`, but it was defined as a property instead of a method. It should have been called directly without parentheses.

To fix this bug, the function `s3_load_path` should be redefined as a property or accessor, and the code should be updated to directly access the value of `s3_load_path` without calling it as a method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `aws_access_key_id`,
      * `aws_secret_access_key`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # redefined s3_load_path as a property
    @property
    def s3_load_path(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        return self._s3_load_path

    @s3_load_path.setter
    def s3_load_path(self, value):
        self._s3_load_path = value

    # other relative functions remain unchanged

        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")

        connection = self.output().connect()

            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
