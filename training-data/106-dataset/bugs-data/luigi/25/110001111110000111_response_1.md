The error message "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" in the test function indicates that there is an attempt to call a string object as a function in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. This could be related to the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, where `s3_load_path` is being called as a function.

In Python, when you define an instance variable and assign a value to it, it becomes an attribute of the class. If the value assigned is a function, then it becomes a method of the class. However, if the value assigned is a string or any other object, it remains an attribute.

The issue here is that `self.s3_load_path` is being mistakenly called as a function, which is causing the TypeError.

To fix this issue, you can directly reference the attribute `self.s3_load_path` without calling it as a function. This will effectively use the value of `self.s3_load_path` without attempting to execute it as a function.

Here's the corrected `run` method for the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Use attribute directly without calling as function
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `self.s3_load_path` attribute is used directly without attempting to call it as a function, resolving the TypeError issue.
