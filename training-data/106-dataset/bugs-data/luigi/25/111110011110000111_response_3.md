The error is occurring in the `S3CopyToTable.run` method when calling `self.s3_load_path()`, which results in a `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`. This error occurs because `self.s3_load_path` is being treated as a method and called with parentheses, but it is defined as a string attribute in the class.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses when referencing `self.s3_load_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `S3CopyToTable.run` method:

```python
    def run(self):
        """
        If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
        will be called to attempt to create the table.
        """
        if not (self.table):
            raise Exception("table need to be specified")
    
        path = self.s3_load_path  # Removed the parentheses
        connection = self.output().connect()
        if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
            # try creating table
            logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
            connection.reset()
            self.create_table(connection)
        elif self.do_truncate_table():
            logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
            self.truncate_table(connection)
    
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        self.init_copy(connection)
        self.copy(cursor, path)
        self.output().touch(connection)
        connection.commit()
    
        # commit and clean up
        connection.close()
```

By removing the parentheses after `self.s3_load_path`, we are now referencing the attribute directly instead of trying to call it as a method. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
