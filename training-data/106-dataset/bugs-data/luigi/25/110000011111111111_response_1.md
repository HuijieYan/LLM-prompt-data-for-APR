The issue is occurring on this line in the "run" method of the "DummyS3CopyToTable" class:
```python
path = self.s3_load_path()
```
The error message indicates a TypeError, specifically 'str' object is not callable.

The reason behind this issue is that "s3_load_path" is being treated as a method and called as a function with parentheses, but it is actually a class attribute of type string. The correct way to access it is without the parentheses.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the parentheses when accessing the "s3_load_path" attribute:
```python
path = self.s3_load_path
```
This fix ensures that we are accessing the value of the "s3_load_path" attribute directly, rather than attempting to call it as a function.

Here's the corrected "run" method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
