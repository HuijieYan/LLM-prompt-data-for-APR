The potential error in the problematic function is the condition `if not (self.table):`. It seems like the intention is to check if the table attribute is empty, but the usage of `not` is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `if not (self.table):` condition will always evaluate to True as long as `self.table` is not None, even if it's an empty string. This will result in the exception not being raised when the table attribute is an empty string.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to `if not self.table:` to properly check if the table attribute is an empty string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
