The error occurs in the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError`, specifically that a string object is not callable.

The reason behind the error is that `self.s3_load_path` is accessed as a method by adding parentheses, but it is actually a parameter. The code should access it as a property rather than as a method.

To fix the bug, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` in the `run` method should be updated to `path = self.s3_load_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table need to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```
