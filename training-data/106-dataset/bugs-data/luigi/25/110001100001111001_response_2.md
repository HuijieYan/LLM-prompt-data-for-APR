The potential error in the provided function is that the `self.table` variable is being checked for existence, but it is not initialized within the function. This could lead to the `Exception` being raised with the message "table need to be specified".

To fix this issue, the `self.table` variable should be initialized before the existence check. Additionally, the `self.init_copy(connection)` function is being called, but it is not defined in the given code.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    If the target table doesn't exist, self.create_table
    will be called to attempt to create the table.
    """
    if not (self.table):
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path()
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table(connection):
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # Assuming self.init_copy(connection) is defined somewhere else
    # self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
``` 

In this corrected function, the `self.table` variable is checked for existence before performing any operations with it. Also, the `self.init_copy(connection)` function call is commented out assuming it is defined somewhere else in the code.
