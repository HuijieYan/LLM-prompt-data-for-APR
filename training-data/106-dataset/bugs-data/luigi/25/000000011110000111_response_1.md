The error message indicates a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable in the function `run` of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error occurs at the line `path = self.s3_load_path()`. This means that `s3_load_path` is being treated as a method and called, but it is a string attribute. 

The issue arises from incorrectly referencing the `s3_load_path` attribute as a method by using `()` after it. The `s3_load_path` should be accessed directly as a property of the class, not called as a method.

To fix this issue, the line `path = self.s3_load_path()` within the `run` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class should be changed to `path = self.s3_load_path`.

Here's the corrected version of the `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    
    if not self.table:
        raise Exception("table needs to be specified")

    path = self.s3_load_path  # Changed from self.s3_load_path() to self.s3_load_path
    connection = self.output().connect()
    if not self.does_table_exist(connection):
        # try creating table
        logger.info("Creating table %s", self.table)
        connection.reset()
        self.create_table(connection)
    elif self.do_truncate_table():
        logger.info("Truncating table %s", self.table)
        self.truncate_table(connection)

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", path)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    self.init_copy(connection)
    self.copy(cursor, path)
    self.output().touch(connection)
    connection.commit()

    # commit and clean up
    connection.close()
```

By making this change, the `s3_load_path` attribute is accessed correctly as a property and does not cause a TypeError.
