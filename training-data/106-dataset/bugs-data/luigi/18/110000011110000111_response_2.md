Potential error location:
The error occurs in the test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable test case when it tries to re-enable a task that should remain disabled. This indicates that the set_status method in the CentralPlannerScheduler class is not handling the transition from DISABLED to FAILED properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function does not handle the transition from DISABLED to FAILED as expected. When a task has failed, it should be disabled for a certain amount of time. However, if a task is manually disabled, it should remain disabled and not automatically re-enable after a certain time period.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The function logic should be updated to differentiate between tasks that were automatically disabled due to excessive failures and tasks that were manually disabled. The code should check whether a task was manually disabled and prevent it from being re-enabled automatically.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and (task.status == RUNNING or task.scheduler_disable_time is not None):
        return
        
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status != DONE:
        return
    elif new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task)

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id, None)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
