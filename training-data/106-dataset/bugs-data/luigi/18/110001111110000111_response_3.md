The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is trying to verify that a task, once manually disabled, should not automatically re-enable after a certain period of time. However, the test is failing because the status of the task is not being updated correctly.


The potential error location within the `set_status` function is the logic for handling the re-enable process after a task has been disabled.


The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the re-enable process after a task has been disabled. The logic for detecting if a task should be re-enabled after a certain period of time is not functioning as expected.


To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the status of the task is correctly updated when it should be re-enabled, and that the conditions for re-enabling a task are properly checked.


Here is the corrected code for the `set_status` function:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    # Logic for handling the re-enable process
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config=config)  # pass the config to re_enable function

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:  # Only update status if it's different
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
``` 

In the corrected code, the `re_enable` method is called with the `config` argument and the logic for status update is modified to only update the status if it's different to avoid unnecessary status updates.
