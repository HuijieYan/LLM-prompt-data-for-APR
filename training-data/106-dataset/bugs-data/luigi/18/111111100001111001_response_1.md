The buggy function `set_status` has multiple issues:
1. It references variables without importing them, such as `FAILURES`, `DISABLED`, and `time`.
2. The `notifications.send_error_email` function is not defined.
3. `self._status_tasks` and `task.status` are being accessed directly instead of through getter and setter methods, which goes against encapsulation principles.

To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Import the required variables from their respective modules.
2. Define the `notifications.send_error_email` function if it's missing.
3. Use getter and setter methods to access `self._status_tasks` and `task.status`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
from notifications_module import send_error_email
from constants_module import FAILED, DISABLED  # Assuming these constants are defined in a separate module
import time  # Assuming time is needed for the functionality of the function

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.get_status() == 'RUNNING':  # assuming get_status and set_status methods are defined in the Task class
            return
    
        if task.get_status() == DISABLED:
            if new_status == 'DONE':  # assuming 'DONE' is a valid status
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.get_scheduler_disable_time() is not None:  #assuming get_scheduler_disable_time method is defined in the Task class
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.get_status() != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.set_scheduler_disable_time(time.time())  #assuming set_scheduler_disable_time is a method in the Task class
                new_status = DISABLED
                send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.get_id()),  #assuming get_id returns the id of the task
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.get_id(),
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.set_scheduler_disable_time(None)  #assuming set_scheduler_disable_time is a method in the Task class
    
        self._status_tasks[task.get_status()].pop(task.get_id())  #assuming get_id returns the id of the task
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.get_id()] = task  #assuming get_id returns the id of the task
        task.set_status(new_status)  #assuming set_status is a method in the Task class
```

In the corrected code:
- I have assumed the existence of getter and setter methods for `status` and `scheduler_disable_time` in the `Task` class. These methods should be defined to ensure encapsulation and proper access to the task's status and scheduler disable time.
- Also, I have assumed the existence of a module for sending error emails and constants for task statuses. These need to be imported for the function to work correctly.

These changes should address the issues and provide more robust and maintainable code.
