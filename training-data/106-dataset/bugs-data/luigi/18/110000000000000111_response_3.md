The potential error in the code is the incorrect use of the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` variables. It seems that these variables are meant to be constants, but they are not defined within the function. Additionally, the function attempts to access other functions and variables that are not defined in the given code snippet, such as `task.can_disable()`, `task.add_failure()`, and `task.has_excessive_failures()`.

To fix the bug, we should define the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` constants and provide the necessary functions and variables required for the logic in the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class TaskStatus:
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"
    DONE = "DONE"
    DISABLED = "DISABLED"
    FAILED = "FAILED"

class Task:

    def __init__(self, task_id):
        self.id = task_id
        self.status = TaskStatus.DONE
        self.scheduler_disable_time = None

    def can_disable(self):
        # function logic to determine if task can be disabled
        pass

    def add_failure(self):
        # function logic to add failure to the task
        pass

    def has_excessive_failures(self):
        # function logic to check if task has excessive failures
        pass

class Config:
    def __init__(self, disable_failures, disable_window, disable_persist):
        self.disable_failures = disable_failures
        self.disable_window = disable_window
        self.disable_persist = disable_persist

class Scheduler:

    def __init__(self):
        self._status_tasks = {TaskStatus.DONE: {}, TaskStatus.RUNNING: {}, TaskStatus.DISABLED: {}, TaskStatus.FAILED: {}}

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == TaskStatus.FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == TaskStatus.DISABLED and task.status == TaskStatus.RUNNING:
            return

        if task.status == TaskStatus.DISABLED:
            if new_status == TaskStatus.DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == TaskStatus.FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != TaskStatus.DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = TaskStatus.DISABLED
                # notifications.send_error_email logic

        elif new_status == TaskStatus.DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        if task.status in self._status_tasks:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status

    def re_enable(self, task):
        # re-enable task logic
        pass
```
