The test case 'test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable' is checking whether a task is re-enabled after being manually disabled and then reaching the criteria for automatic re-enable after a certain time. The error message indicates that the task status is not as expected - it is showing 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the 'set_status' function is likely in the section where the task status is being updated. The conditions for updating the status based on the new status and the current task status might be incorrect.

The bug occurred because the function is not handling the transition from 'DISABLED' to 'FAILED' status correctly. The code logic for handling this transition is incorrect, leading to the task status being set to 'FAILED' instead of remaining 'DISABLED'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for transitioning from 'DISABLED' to 'FAILED' in the 'set_status' function. We should also ensure that the task status is being handled correctly for all possible transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the 'set_status' function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic for transitioning from 'DISABLED' to 'FAILED' and handling the task status update has been improved to ensure that the status is set correctly based on the conditions. This should fix the bug and ensure that the task status is updated as expected.
