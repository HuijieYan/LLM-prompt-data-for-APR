The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is attempting to verify that a task with the status of `FAILED` is correctly transitioning to `DISABLED` after reaching the maximum number of failures and then remaining in the `DISABLED` status even after 100 seconds.

Looking at the error message, it appears that the task's status is not transitioning from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` as intended, which causes the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `set_status` method is likely in the block handling the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED`. It seems that the logic for transitioning the task status from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` based on the number of failures and the elapsed time is not implemented correctly.

The bug is occurring because the logic to transition a task from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` after reaching the maximum number of failures and then maintaining that status is not correctly implemented. The logic for checking the number of failures, time elapsed, and transitioning the status is not correctly applied.

To fix the bug, the `set_status` method should correctly handle the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` based on the number of failures and the elapsed time, as well as ensuring that the status remains `DISABLED` after the specified time.

Here's the corrected version of the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == RUNNING and task.scheduler_disable_time + config.disable_persist < time.time():
            return
    elif new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to check if the `FAILED` task has been disabled for a period equal to `config.disable_persist` and if so, it will remain disabled. This ensures that the task remains in the `DISABLED` status even after the specified time has elapsed.
