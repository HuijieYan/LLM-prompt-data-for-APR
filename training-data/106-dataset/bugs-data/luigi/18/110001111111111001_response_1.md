Based on the provided case and the error message, it seems that the `set_status` function is not correctly managing the status of the task. The function is not properly handling the transition of the task's status from `FAILED` to `DISABLED`.

The bug occurs because when transitioning from `FAILED` to `DISABLED`, the function sets the new status as `FAILED` instead of `DISABLED`. This results in the task's status not being updated correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles the transition from `FAILED` to `DISABLED` and ensure that the new status is set as `DISABLED` when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        elif new_status == FAILED:  # Modified this condition to handle the transition correctly
            if task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
                task.add_failure()
                if task.has_excessive_failures():
                    task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                    new_status = DISABLED
                    notifications.send_error_email(
                        'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                        '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                        'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                            failures=config.disable_failures,
                            task=task.id,
                            window=config.disable_window,
                            persist=config.disable_persist,
                        ))
        else:
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these changes, the `set_status` function should correctly handle the transitions between `FAILED`, `DISABLED`, and other statuses. This should address the issue observed in the test case.
