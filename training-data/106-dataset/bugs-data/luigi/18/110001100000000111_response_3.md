The potential error in the function is that the logic for setting the status of the task is not correctly implemented. The code is not properly handling the status transitions and conditions for setting the status of the task.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the transition of task status and does not check for the necessary conditions before setting the new status.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check for the current status of the task, validate the new status based on the current status, and then update the status accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            task.status = new_status
            return

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    
    if new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status != task.status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
