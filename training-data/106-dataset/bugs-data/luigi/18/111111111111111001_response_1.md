Based on the test case and the error message, the issue seems to be with the re-enable logic after the task has been disabled. The task should not be re-enabled after being manually disabled.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `set_status` method, specifically in the block that handles re-enabling the task after it has been manually disabled.

The bug occurs because when the task is manually disabled, the `re_enable` method is called, which would re-enable the task. However, the test case expects the task to remain disabled.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the logic in the `set_status` method to not re-enable the task if it has been manually disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        return  # Do nothing if the task is already disabled

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

This corrected code explicitly checks if the task is already disabled and skips the re-enable logic in that case.
