Potential error location: The potential error is in the comparison of `new_status` with constant values like `FAILED` and `DISABLED` without specifying where these constants are defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` constants are not defined in the function. Additionally, the function is using `assert` to check if `config` is not None, but this should be handled differently to prevent the program from halting if the condition is not met.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Define the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` constants or use the string literals directly in the code.
- Handle the check for `config` not being None differently, such as using an `if` statement and raising an exception if `config` is None.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

# corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "failed"
    DISABLED = "disabled"

    if new_status == FAILED:
        if config is None:
            raise ValueError("Config cannot be None for FAILED status")

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "running":
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "done":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:  # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task.id} due to excessive failures',
                f'{task.id} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, '
                f'so it is being disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
            )
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
