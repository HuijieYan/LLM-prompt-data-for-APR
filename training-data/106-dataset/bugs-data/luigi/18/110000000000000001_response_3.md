Potential error location: 
The main potential error in the given function is the comparison of `new_status` with `FAILED` and `DISABLED`. The function does not define `FAILED` and `DISABLED` as constants or variables, so these comparisons will result in errors.

Reason for the bug:
The function is comparing `new_status` with `FAILED` and `DISABLED`, assuming that these are constants or variables, but they are not defined within the function.

Possible fix:
Define `FAILED` and `DISABLED` as constants or variables within the function, or pass them as arguments to the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None, FAILED="FAILED", DISABLED="DISABLED"):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == "DISABLED":
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != "DISABLED":
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
