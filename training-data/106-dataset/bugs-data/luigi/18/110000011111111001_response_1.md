The error occurred because in the given function, when the status of a task changes from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED', it should remain 'DISABLED' after being manually set. However, due to some logical errors, the status changes from 'DISABLED' back to 'FAILED'.

The potential error is located in the conditional block:
```python
if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
    return
```

This condition should actually check if `task.status` is equal to 'FAILED' instead of 'RUNNING'. This is because the status should remain 'DISABLED' if it was manually set to that value.

To fix this bug, the condition `task.status == RUNNING` should be changed to `task.status == FAILED`.
Additionally, in the first conditional block in the function, FAILED should be enclosed in quotes, i.e., 'FAILED'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'FAILED':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                f'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures',
                f'{task} failed {config.disable_failures} times in the last {config.disable_window} seconds, so it is being '
                f'disabled for {config.disable_persist} seconds'
            )
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these changes, the function should behave as expected without causing the status to revert from 'DISABLED' to 'FAILED' after being manually set.
