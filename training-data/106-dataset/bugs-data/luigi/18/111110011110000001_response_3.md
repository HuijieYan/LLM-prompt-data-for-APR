The test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable test case is trying to ensure that a task stays in the DISABLED status after 100 seconds have passed. However, the test fails with an AssertionError stating that the task status is FAILED instead of DISABLED.

The potential error in the code is the set_status method of the SimpleTaskState class. Specifically, the section where the status is being set to DISABLED is likely causing the issue.

The reason behind the bug is that the status is not being set correctly when the task is supposed to stay in the DISABLED status after 100 seconds.

To fix the bug, the status should only be set to DISABLED if the conditions for setting it to FAILED are met. Otherwise, the status should remain as DISABLED.

Here's the corrected code for the set_status method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == FAILED:
            # Don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
                
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, the status should now be set correctly, and the test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable test case should pass without any issues.
