The issue in the `set_status` function arises from the incorrect handling of task status updates and the logic associated with the new_status provided. 

The following steps can be taken to fix the bug:
1. The first if condition should check for the value of new_status and not for the variable FAILED. So, it should be `if new_status == 'FAILED'` instead of `if new_status == FAILED`.
2. Ensure that when the task status is updated to DISABLED, the `scheduler_disable_time` is set and unset appropriately.
3. It seems there is a missing import for the `time` module, so it should be imported at the beginning of the file with `import time`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import time

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistence.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, e.g. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == 'FAILED':
            assert config is not None

            return
    
        if task.status == 'DISABLED':
            if new_status == 'DONE':
                self.re_enable(task)

            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
