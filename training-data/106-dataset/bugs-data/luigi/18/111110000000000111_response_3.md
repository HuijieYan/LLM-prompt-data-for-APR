Potential Error location:
The if statement `if new_status == FAILED: assert config is not None` is not handling the case where the `config` parameter is not passed. This could potentially lead to the assert statement failing if `new_status` is `FAILED` and `config` is not provided.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where the `config` parameter is not provided when `new_status` is `FAILED`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause the assert statement to fail.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check for the presence of the `config` parameter before asserting its value. If `new_status` is `FAILED` and `config` is not provided, we can raise a ValueError or handle the case accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        if config is None:
            raise ValueError("Config parameter must be provided when setting status to FAILED")
    
    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return
    
    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
    
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
