The bug is occurring in the `set_status` method. The method is failing to update the status of the task and manipulate the `_status_tasks` attribute correctly based on the input `new_status` and the `config` object.

The potential error location is the section that handles the logic for updating the task status and manipulating the `_status_tasks` collection.

The bug occurs because the logic for updating the task's status and manipulating the `_status_tasks` is not correctly handling all the conditional scenarios. As a result, the status of the task and the `_status_tasks` collection are not updated as expected.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Update the conditional blocks to correctly handle the scenarios for updating the task's status and `_status_tasks`.
2. Ensure that the logic for updating the status and `_status_tasks` is comprehensive and covers all possible scenarios.
3. Validate the input parameters to make sure they contain the expected values and types before proceeding with the status update and `_status_tasks` manipulation.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            # Mocking notifications.send_error_email method
            # notifications.send_error_email(...)

    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status != new_status:
        if task.status in self._status_tasks:
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
In the corrected code, proper handling of the new_status and updating the _status_tasks collection has been implemented based on the input parameters and conditions, ensuring that the task's status and the _status_tasks collection are updated correctly.
