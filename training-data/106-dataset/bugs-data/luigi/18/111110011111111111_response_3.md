The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` aims to verify that a task remains disabled even after a period of time has passed. However, the error message indicates that the status of the task is unexpectedly changed to 'FAILED' instead of remaining 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic related to the condition handling of the new status being set to 'FAILED'. This is evident from the fact that the status is changed to 'FAILED' instead of remaining 'DISABLED' as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the handling for setting the task status to 'FAILED' does not consider the scenario where the task is already in a disabled state due to excessive failures. Therefore, the status is wrongly updated to 'FAILED' instead of remaining 'DISABLED'.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the function to correctly handle the scenario where the task is already in a disabled state, and preventing it from being set to 'FAILED' in this case.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == DISABLED:
        return  # Prevent setting to DISABLED directly

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the logic is updated to prevent setting the status to 'FAILED' directly if the task is already in a disabled state. The disabled state is correctly maintained, and the status is not updated to 'FAILED' in this situation.
