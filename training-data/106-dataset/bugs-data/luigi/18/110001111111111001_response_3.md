The test case "test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable" is checking whether a task can be automatically re-enabled after being automatically disabled and then manually disabled. The test sets up a task with two failed statuses, which should automatically disable the task. Then, it manually disables the task and checks that it remains disabled even after 100 seconds.

The error message indicates that the status of the task is not as expected. It shows that the status should be "DISABLED" but it is actually "FAILED".

The potential error location is within the "set_status" function, which is designed to handle different statuses of tasks. It incorrectly sets the new status to "FAILED" instead of "DISABLED" in certain situations.

The bug occurs because the code logic does not correctly handle when a task is manually disabled and then should remain in that state, even after a certain amount of time has passed.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting the status of a task, especially when transitioning from "DISABLED" to another status.

Here's the corrected code for the "set_status" function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        else:
            return  # Do not allow further transitions for manually disabled tasks

    # rest of the logic...

    # Remove the existing status entry for the task
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)

    # Update the status of the task and add it to the appropriate status entry
    task.status = new_status
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly handles the transition of tasks from "DISABLED" to other statuses, ensuring that a manually disabled task remains in that state without being automatically re-enabled.

This should fix the bug and allow the test "test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable" to pass successfully.
