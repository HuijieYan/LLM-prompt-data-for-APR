The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is checking whether a task should remain disabled after being set to a disabled state manually, even if it has exceeded a failure threshold. The test is failing with an assertion error because the task's status is not remaining as 'DISABLED' after the specified time has passed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for setting the task status and re-enabling the task based on failure thresholds and time windows.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the task should remain in the disabled state after being manually set to 'DISABLED'. It may also not be correctly re-enabling the task after the specified time has passed.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the task status and re-enabling it based on failure thresholds and time windows needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the task status is correctly updated and that the re-enablement is triggered when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        return  # If the task is disabled, return without further checks as it should remain disabled

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the function explicitly checks for the case where the task is already disabled and returns without further checks. This ensures that the task remains disabled if it was manually set to 'DISABLED'. Additionally, the logic for re-enablement based on time checks and failure thresholds should be reviewed to ensure it functions correctly.
