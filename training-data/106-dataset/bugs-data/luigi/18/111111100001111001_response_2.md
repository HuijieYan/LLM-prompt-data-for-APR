The buggy code checks if a task status is "FAILED" and then performs conditional operations based on this status. However, there are a few issues in the code:

1. The value "FAILED" is never imported or defined in the code, so it should be defined or imported to compare new_status with it. Assuming "FAILED" is a constant string, I will add an import statement to import it.

2. The block of code that checks for a new_status of "DISABLED" does not set the scheduler_disable_time, leading to incorrect functionality.

3. The code to check for excessive failures and send notifications is missing.

To fix the issues, I will need to:
- Import or define the constant "FAILED".
- Update the code to properly assign the scheduler_disable_time when the new_status is set to "DISABLED".
- Add the logic to check for excessive failures and send notifications accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from luigi.constants import FAILED

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistence.

    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, e.g. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes inherit from.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Set the disable time when changing to DISABLED status

        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
                task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # Reset the disable time when changing to DONE status
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Set the disable time when excessive failures occur
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = 0  # An appropriate value when task is DISABLED

        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In this corrected code:
- Always ensure that the scheduler_disable_time is correctly set for both enabling and disabling a task.
- Additional logic has been added to handle excessive failures and send notifications as needed.
