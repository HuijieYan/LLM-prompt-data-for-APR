Potential error location: 

The issue lies in the section of code responsible for handling the transition of the task's status to 'FAILED'. Specifically, when the task has excessive failures, it should be disabled, and an error email should be sent. However, there are issues with the logic and handling of the different statuses.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

1. The `task.add_failure()` and `task.has_excessive_failures()` functions are not implemented correctly.
2. In the case where the new status is 'DISABLED' and the task is not in the 'DISABLED' status, the scheduler_disable_time should be set, and an error email should be sent.

Approach for fixing the bug:

1. Implement the `task.add_failure()` and `task.has_excessive_failures()` functions to correctly track and check for excessive failures.
2. Ensure that the state transitions of the task between different statuses are handled appropriately, setting the `scheduler_disable_time` when necessary and sending the error email.

Updated/Created Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
