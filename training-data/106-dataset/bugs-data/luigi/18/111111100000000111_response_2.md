The potential error in the `set_status` function is that the `FAILED` constant is used without being defined anywhere in the code provided. Additionally, the `notifications` object is being used without being defined in the code.

To fix the bug, the `FAILED` constant needs to be defined, and the `notifications` module needs to be imported in order to use the `send_error_email` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
import time
from notifications import send_error_email  # assuming notifications is a module with send_error_email function

# define the FAILED constant
FAILED = "FAILED"
DISABLED = "DISABLED"
DONE = "DONE"

class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistance.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, eg. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

This corrected code assumes that the `notifications` module contains a `send_error_email` function that can be used to send email notifications. You may need to adjust the import statement according to the actual structure of your project.
