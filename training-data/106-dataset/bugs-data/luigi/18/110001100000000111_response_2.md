The potential error in the `set_status` function is that the constants FAILED and DISABLED are not defined, so the conditional checks using these constants will result in NameError.

To fix this bug, we need to define the constants FAILED and DISABLED, and then use them in the conditional checks.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "failed"  # Define FAILED constant
    DISABLED = "disabled"  # Define DISABLED constant

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "running":  # Assuming task.status is a string
        return

    if task.status == "disabled":
        if new_status == "done":  # Assuming "done" is the status for task completion
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != "disabled":
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, we have defined the constants FAILED and DISABLED and replaced the undefined constants in the conditional checks.
