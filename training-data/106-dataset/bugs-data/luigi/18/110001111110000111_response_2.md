Based on the error message and the test case, it seems that the 'A' task is showing the wrong status. The error message indicates that it is showing 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic handling the status change in the 'set_status' function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a misinterpreted logic in the 'set_status' function. This misinterpretation could lead to the wrong status being set for the task.

To fix the bug, the logic for changing the task status in the 'set_status' function should be carefully reviewed and corrected, ensuring that the correct status is set based on the conditions and requirements specified in the test case.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the 'set_status' function and add conditional statements to correctly set the status based on the test case requirements. This may involve adjusting the logic for handling status changes when a task is disabled or re-enabled.

Here is the corrected 'set_status' function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status != DISABLED:  # make sure new_status is not DISABLED to avoid status override
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
            new_status = DISABLED
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, additional condition checking is added to ensure that the correct status is set based on the test case requirements.
