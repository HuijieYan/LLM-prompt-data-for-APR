The test case "test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable" interacts with the "add_failure" and "set_status" functions. It sets the status of task 'A' to FAILED twice, then checks if the task is DISABLED. Afterward, it manually sets the status to DISABLED and finally checks if the task remains DISABLED after 100 seconds.

The error message indicates that the status of task 'A' is FAILED instead of being DISABLED as expected.

Upon analyzing the function "set_status", it seems to have issues with how it handles the transitions between different task statuses. Based on the provided code and the error message, it appears that when the task status is set to DISABLED manually, the function is not recognizing that it should remain DISABLED after 100 seconds.

The potential error lies in the conditional checks and state transitions within the "set_status" function. It is not handling the case where a task is manually set to DISABLED and should remain disabled after a certain period.

The bug occurs because the "set_status" function does not properly handle the case where a task is manually set to DISABLED and should remain in that state after a certain period. Additionally, it may not be effectively updating the status of the task and the internal data structures.

To fix the bug, the "set_status" function needs to be modified to include proper handling of the transition of a task from manual DISABLED to remaining DISABLED after a certain period. This may involve adjusting the conditional checks and the update of internal data structures to accurately reflect the task's status.

Here's the corrected code for the "set_status" function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
            return
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    # Update the status only if the new status is different
    if task.status != new_status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In this corrected code, the function now properly handles the transition of a task from manual DISABLED to remaining DISABLED after a certain period. It also ensures that the status and internal data structures are updated accordingly.
