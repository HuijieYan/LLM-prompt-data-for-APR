The problem occurs when the task is in a 'FAILED' status and then manually set to 'DISABLED'. According to the buggy function, when a task is failed, it can be disabled automatically due to excessive failures. But if it's manually set to 'DISABLED', it should remain disabled. However, the buggy function is not handling this case correctly, resulting in the test failure.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if the new status is 'DISABLED' and the task is already in 'DISABLED' status, in which case it should not change its status.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DISABLED:  # check if already disabled
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED and new_status == DONE:
        self.re_enable(task)

    # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
    elif task.status == DISABLED and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
        return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

By adding a check for the case where the new status is 'DISABLED' and the task is already in 'DISABLED' status, the function should now handle this scenario correctly and pass the test case without an assertion error.
