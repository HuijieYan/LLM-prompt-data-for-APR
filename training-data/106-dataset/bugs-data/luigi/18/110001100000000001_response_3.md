Potential error location: The error may occur in the conditions checking for new_status and task.status, as well as in the re_enable and has_excessive_failures functions.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur due to incorrect conditions for checking new_status and task.status, as well as potential issues with the re_enable and has_excessive_failures functions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions for new_status and task.status to ensure they are correctly implemented.
2. Verify the re_enable and has_excessive_failures functions to ensure they are functioning as expected.
3. Use proper error handling to address any potential issues that arise in the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from time import time

class Scheduler:
    # ... other functions ...

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == 'FAILED':
            assert config is not None
        
        if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
            return
        
        if task.status == 'DISABLED':
            if new_status == 'DONE':
                self.re_enable(task, config)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
        
        if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time()
                new_status = 'DISABLED'
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
        elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
