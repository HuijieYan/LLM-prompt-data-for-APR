The error message indicates that the status of the task is not being set correctly, as the expected result is DISABLED but the actual result is FAILED.

The potential error location within the `set_status` function is likely in the conditionals that handle the status transitions.

The bug occurs because when the task status is set to DISABLED manually, the conditions for re-enabling the task after a certain time are not being checked correctly. This causes the task status to remain as FAILED even after the specified time has passed, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for re-enabling the task after a certain time are properly evaluated and the task status is updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status != DISABLED and task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and time.time() - task.scheduler_disable_time >= config.disable_persist:
            new_status = task.status

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if task.status in self._status_tasks:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With these corrections, the function now properly handles the transition between task statuses, including re-enabling the task after a certain time has passed.
