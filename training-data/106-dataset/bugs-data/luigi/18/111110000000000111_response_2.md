Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the `set_status` function lies in the if-else conditions and the usage of `task.status` without considering the object's context.

Reason for Bug:
The bug may occur because the conditions do not cover all possible scenarios. Additionally, the code does not handle the comparison and assignment of `task.status` correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditionals to cover all possible scenarios for `new_status` and `task.status`.
2. Use the correct comparison operators and consider the context of the `task` object when accessing its `status` attribute.
3. Ensure that all paths through the function lead to a valid state for the `task` object.


# Corrected Code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    """
    Keep track of the current state and handle persistence.
    
    The point of this class is to enable other ways to keep state, e.g. by using a database
    These will be implemented by creating an abstract base class that this and other classes
    inherit from.
