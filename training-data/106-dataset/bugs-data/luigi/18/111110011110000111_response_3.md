The test case "test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable" is checking whether a task remains disabled after being manually set to disabled. The test sets the initial status of the task to FAILED and then to DISABLED, and then checks if the status remains DISABLED after 101 seconds.

The error message indicates that the status of the task is expected to be DISABLED but is actually FAILED.

Potential error location within the problematic function:
The bug is likely in the logic for handling the new_status and the current status of the task in the "set_status" function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the new_status and the current status of the task within the "set_status" function. The logic for transitioning between different statuses seems to be incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions for transitioning between different statuses and ensure that they are handled correctly.
2. Verify the logic for transitioning to the DISABLED status and ensure that it aligns with the test case expectations.
3. Pay close attention to the conditional statements for the transitions and make necessary adjustments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif new_status == FAILED:
            return  # Prevent transitioning from DISABLED to FAILED

    if new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
