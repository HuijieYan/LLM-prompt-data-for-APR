The potential error in the provided function is that the logic for setting the `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not correctly implemented. It seems to be setting the value of `task.scheduler_disable_time` to `time.time()` under certain conditions, but it should be considering the `disable_persist` configuration value as well.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the setting of `task.scheduler_disable_time` when updating the status of the task.

To fix the bug, the function needs to consider the `disable_persist` configuration value when setting `task.scheduler_disable_time` and also consider the status transitions, especially when transitioning to or from the 'DISABLED' status.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import time

def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            # Consider the disable_persist config value
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist

    # Update the status of the task and the status tasks dictionary
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, I've added the consideration of `config.disable_persist` when setting the `task.scheduler_disable_time` for both the 'FAILED' status and 'DISABLED' status. Additionally, the status transitions and status tasks dictionary update logic have been retained.
