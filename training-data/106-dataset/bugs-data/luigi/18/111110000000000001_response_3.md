Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the provided function is when checking for the `FAILED` status and asserting that `config` is not None. This could lead to an assertion error if the `config` is not provided when setting the status to `FAILED`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `config` is not provided when setting the status to `FAILED`. The assertion should allow for `config` to be optional, but the function currently does not account for that.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to handle the case when `config` is not provided when the status is set to `FAILED`.
2. Use a default value for `config` if it is not provided when setting the status to `FAILED`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None or config is None  # allow for config to be optional
    
        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return
    
        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
    
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return
    
        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures if config else None,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window if config else None,
                        persist=config.disable_persist if config else None,
                    ))
        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
