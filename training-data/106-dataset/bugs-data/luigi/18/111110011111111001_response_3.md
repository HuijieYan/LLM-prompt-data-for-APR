The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' is expected to be 'DISABLED' after the time has passed, but it is actually 'FAILED'.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the bug is due to incorrect conditional sequencing and logic. Specifically, the logic for handling the 'FAILED' status and its related actions seem to be causing the bug.

The bug occurs because in the buggy implementation, if the new_status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled, the status is updated to 'DISABLED' and an error email is sent immediately. However, after this action is taken, the status of the task is not updated to 'DISABLED' and remains 'FAILED', which causes the test failure.

To fix the bug:
1. If the new_status is 'FAILED' and the task can be disabled, update the status to 'DISABLED' before sending the error email.
2. If the task has excessive failures, set the task's scheduler_disable_time and update the status to 'DISABLED' before sending the error email.
3. When updating the status of the task, make sure to update it in the _status_tasks dictionary as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED  # Update the new_status to 'DISABLED' here
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    
            # Update the task status and the _status_tasks dictionary
            self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
            self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
            task.status = new_status
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

        # Update the task status and the _status_tasks dictionary
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```
With these corrections, the function should behave as expected and the test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` should pass without errors.
