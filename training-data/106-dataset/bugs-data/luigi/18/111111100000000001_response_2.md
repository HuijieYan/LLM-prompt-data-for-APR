The potential error in the provided code is the conditional checks for the variable `new_status` and `task.status` within the `set_status` function. The reason for the bug is that the conditional checks are not properly handling the status transitions for the tasks. 

To fix the bug, the conditional checks need to be modified to correctly handle the status transitions. Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == 'FAILED':
        assert config is not None
        
    if new_status == 'DISABLED' and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return
    
    if task.status == 'DISABLED':
        if new_status == 'DONE':
            self.re_enable(task)
        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return
    
    if new_status == 'FAILED' and task.can_disable() and task.status != 'DISABLED':
        self.add_failure(task)
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = 'DISABLED'
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == 'DISABLED':
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None
    
    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been modified to handle the status transitions properly. Also, the `'FAILED'` and `'DISABLED'` status values have been changed to string literals, as it seems that they are intended to be strings. Additionally, the `add_failure` function has been used instead of `task.add_failure()` to ensure the correct method is called.
