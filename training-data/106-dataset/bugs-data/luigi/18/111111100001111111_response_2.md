The bug is likely located in the section where the function is updating the status of the task. The code does not correctly handle the transition to the DISABLED state and has issues related to setting the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute of the task.

The bug occurs because there are incorrect conditional statements and logic issues in handling the status transitions. Additionally, there are scenarios where the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute might not be set correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to redefine the conditional statements for handling the different status transitions. Additionally, the logic for setting the `scheduler_disable_time` attribute needs to be reviewed and updated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == 'RUNNING':
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config=config)
        else:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = None  # Reset scheduler_disable_time in other cases

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time() + config.disable_persist  # Set the scheduler_disable_time attribute correctly
            new_status = DISABLED
            # notifications.send_error_email(...)  # Notifications are not implemented, so this line needs to be updated or removed

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
