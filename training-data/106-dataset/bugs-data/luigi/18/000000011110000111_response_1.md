The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is checking whether a task remains disabled even after 100 seconds. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the task is showing the status as 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the status of the task is being updated and checked.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the transition of a task from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' status.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the transition of a task from 'FAILED' to 'DISABLED' status. This can be done by correctly setting the new status and updating the task status in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        if task.status != DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
