The error message indicates that the status of the task 'A' is not as expected. The test case is testing the behavior of the task status after setting it to DISABLED and waiting for 100 seconds. The expected behavior is that the task should remain DISABLED, but the actual behavior is that the task status changes to FAILED.

Potential error location: The buggy function that needs to be fixed is likely causing incorrect status transitions for the tasks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be related to the logic in the `set_status` function that handles the status transitions for tasks. It seems that the conditions for transitioning to the DISABLED status may not be correctly implemented, resulting in an incorrect transition to the FAILED status after 100 seconds.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The conditions for status transitions, especially when transitioning to the DISABLED status and handling the elapsed time, need to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the treatment of different status scenarios needs to be thoroughly checked to ensure that the status transitions are handled correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class SimpleTaskState(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def re_enable(self, task, config=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
        if new_status == FAILED:
            assert config is not None

        if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
            return

        if task.status == DISABLED:
            if new_status == DONE:
                self.re_enable(task)
            elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and new_status != DISABLED:  # Add this condition to prevent overriding scheduler disable
                return

        if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
            else:
                return  # Missing this return statement which resulted in incorrect status changes

        elif new_status == DISABLED:
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()  # Reset scheduler_disable_time

        # Add the task to the new status and ensure it's removed from the old status
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id, None)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
```

In the corrected code:
1. There is proper handling to prevent overriding scheduler disable when transitioning from DISABLED to any other status.
2. When transitioning to the FAILED status, a return statement was added to prevent further execution if the task does not have excessive failures.
3. Resetting the `task.scheduler_disable_time` when transitioning to the DISABLED status.

These modifications should address the issues and ensure correct status transitions for the tasks.
