The potential error location within the problematic function is the `task.add_failure()` function call. This is where the bug is likely occurring.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not properly handle the task failure and disable logic. The function does not take into consideration all possible scenarios when a task fails or is disabled.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to restructure the logic for handling task status changes, particularly for handling task failures and disabling. Proper checks and conditions should be used to ensure that the status changes are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and (task.status == RUNNING or task.status == DISABLED):
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures(config.disable_failures, config.disable_window):
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```
