The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is attempting to set a task's status to DISABLED and then checks if the status remains DISABLED after 101 seconds. However, the error message indicates that the status is 'FAILED' instead of 'DISABLED'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checking for a new status of DISABLED and the task's status being RUNNING. It seems that this condition is causing the task to change its status to FAILED instead of remaining DISABLED.

The bug occurs because the condition for setting a new status of DISABLED is being triggered, resulting in the task's status being changed to FAILED instead. This is likely due to the order of the conditions in the if statements not being properly handled.

To fix the bug, we need to restructure the if statements and ensure that the conditions are evaluated in the correct order to prevent the task's status from being unintentionally changed. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison values are correctly matched.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` method:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED:
        if task.status == RUNNING:  # Move this condition to prevent changing to FAILED
            return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

By rearranging the conditions and ensuring the comparison values are correctly matched, the bug causing the task's status to change incorrectly should now be fixed.
