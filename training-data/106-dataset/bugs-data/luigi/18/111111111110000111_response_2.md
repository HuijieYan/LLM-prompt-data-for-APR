Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `set_status` function within the `SimpleTaskState` class. It seems that the status is not being properly updated when attempting to re-enable a task after being disabled.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely happening due to incorrect status updates. When attempting to re-enable a task after it has been disabled, the status is not being properly set to `DISABLED`. This leads to the test case failing as it expects the task status to be `DISABLED` but it is actually `FAILED`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for setting the task status in the `set_status` function to ensure that it correctly reflects the new state of the task.
2. Check the conditions for re-enabling a task and ensure that the status is properly updated according to the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task, config)  # Updated to pass the config
        elif new_status == FAILED:
            # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
            if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
                return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status != task.status:
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
