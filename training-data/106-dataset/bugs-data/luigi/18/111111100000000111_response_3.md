Potential error location: The issue may be in the section where the `new_status` is checked and the `task.status` is compared to determine the appropriate actions.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The code is not checking for the existence of the `FAILED` variable, assuming it is defined elsewhere.
2. There is a missing check for the `DISABLED` status before re-enabling a task.
3. The code might not be handling the case where `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None but new_status is not FAILED.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `FAILED` and `DISABLED` constants if they are not already defined.
2. Add a check for the `DISABLED` status before re-enabling a task in the `set_status` function.
3. Ensure to handle the case where `task.scheduler_disable_time` is not None but `new_status` is not FAILED.

Corrected code:
```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    FAILED = "FAILED"
    DISABLED = "DISABLED"

    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == "RUNNING":
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "DONE":
            self.re_enable(task)
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None and new_status != FAILED:  # added a check for new_status not being FAILED
            return

    if new_status == FAILED:
        if task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:  # added a check for task.status not being DISABLED
            task.add_failure()
            if task.has_excessive_failures():
                task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
                new_status = DISABLED
                notifications.send_error_email(
                    'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                    '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                    'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                        failures=config.disable_failures,
                        task=task.id,
                        window=config.disable_window,
                        persist=config.disable_persist,
                    ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    if new_status != FAILED:  # added a check for new_status not being FAILED
        self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
        self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
        task.status = new_status
