Potential Error Location: The function is trying to access a variable `FAILED` without declaring it. Also, there are references to other undefined variables like `notifications` and `time`.

Reasons for Bug: The code contains references to variables/functions that are not defined within the function or its scope. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Define the `FAILED` variable before using it.
2. Define the missing variables/functions like `notifications` and `time` either within the function or import them from an external source.
3. Use proper error handling to ensure that the function behaves correctly even when unexpected inputs are provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time  # import the time module if it's not already imported

# define FAILED variable
FAILED = "FAILED"

# define notifications.send_error_email function
def send_error_email(subject, message):
    # implement the logic to send error email
    pass

# corrected function
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == "DONE":  # changed to string as the variable is not declared
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = "DISABLED"  # changed to string as the variable is not declared
            send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == "DISABLED":  # changed to string as the variable is not declared
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
