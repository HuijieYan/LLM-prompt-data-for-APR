The test case `test_no_automatic_re_enable_after_auto_then_manual_disable` is trying to determine if a task, after being automatically disabled due to excessive failures, will remain disabled even after a manual attempt to set its status to disabled. Then, after 100 seconds have passed, the task should still remain disabled.

The error message indicates that the expected value for the task status is 'DISABLED', but the actual value obtained is 'FAILED'.

Based on the input parameter values provided, it is evident that the `set_status` function has a bug. The bug occurs when a task is manually set to the 'DISABLED' status and the scheduler later attempts to re-enable the task after a certain period of time, while ignoring the manual setting.

The bug occurs because the function does not incorporate the logic to handle the scenario where a task has been manually disabled and should not be re-enabled automatically. The code does not have a condition to check if the task was manually disabled. As a result, the task is incorrectly updated to 'FAILED' status, which indicates that it was not properly handled during re-enabling.

To fix the bug, the `set_status` function should include a check to verify if the task was manually disabled, and if so, it should not attempt to re-enable the task after the specified period of time.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_status` function:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        # Check if the task was manually disabled
        if task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
```

With this correction, the `set_status` function will properly handle the scenario where a task has been manually disabled and will prevent automatic re-enabling after a specified period.
