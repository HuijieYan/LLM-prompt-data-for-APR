Potential error location: 
The bug may be in the condition where new_status is FAILED and task.can_disable() is True, but the task status is not DISABLED. In this case, the task.add_failure() should be called before checking if task has excessive failures.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug occurs because the check for excessive failures and adding a failure to the task are not in the correct order. This causes the task to potentially be disabled before the failure is added.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Move task.add_failure() before the check for excessive failures.
2. Ensure that the task status is not changed to DISABLED before adding a failure to the task.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_status(self, task, new_status, config=None):
    if new_status == FAILED:
        assert config is not None

    if new_status == DISABLED and task.status == RUNNING:
        return

    if task.status == DISABLED:
        if new_status == DONE:
            self.re_enable(task)

        # don't allow workers to override a scheduler disable
        elif task.scheduler_disable_time is not None:
            return

    if new_status == FAILED and task.can_disable() and task.status != DISABLED:
        task.add_failure()  # Moved this line before checking for excessive failures
        if task.has_excessive_failures():
            task.scheduler_disable_time = time.time()
            new_status = DISABLED
            notifications.send_error_email(
                'Luigi Scheduler: DISABLED {task} due to excessive failures'.format(task=task.id),
                '{task} failed {failures} times in the last {window} seconds, so it is being '
                'disabled for {persist} seconds'.format(
                    failures=config.disable_failures,
                    task=task.id,
                    window=config.disable_window,
                    persist=config.disable_persist,
                ))
    elif new_status == DISABLED:
        task.scheduler_disable_time = None

    self._status_tasks[task.status].pop(task.id)
    self._status_tasks[new_status][task.id] = task
    task.status = new_status
