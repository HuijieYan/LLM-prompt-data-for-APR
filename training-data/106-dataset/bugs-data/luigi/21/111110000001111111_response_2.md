The potential error in the function is the insertion of task family name and the '--local-scheduler' flag into the `cmdline_args` list. This insertion may cause issues with the parsing of command line arguments and can disrupt the normal flow of the function.

The reason behind the bug is that the insertion of task family name and '--local-scheduler' is not necessary in the `cmdline_args` list. The `main_task_cls.task_family` and `local_scheduler` flags are already provided as input parameters to the function, so there is no need to insert them into the `cmdline_args` list.

To fix the bug, we should remove the lines that insert `main_task_cls.task_family` and '--local-scheduler' into the `cmdline_args` list. The function should only use the `cmdline_args` list that is passed as a parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None, worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please don't use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```
