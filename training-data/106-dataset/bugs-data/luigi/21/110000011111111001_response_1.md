The error occurs in the `run` function at the line `cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)` because `cmdline_args` is `None`, and Python is trying to call the `insert` method on a `NoneType` object.

It seems that the `cmdline_args` are not being properly initialized or passed to the `run` function. The function is expecting a list of command line arguments, but it is receiving `None` instead. This is likely due to the fact that the `cmdline_args` parameter is set to `None` by default in the function signature, and it is not being overridden when the function is called.

To fix this issue, we can initialize `cmdline_args` to an empty list by default in the function signature. This will ensure that `cmdline_args` is always a list, even if it is not provided when the function is called. 

Here's the corrected `run` function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=[], main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

By setting `cmdline_args` to `[]` in the function signature, we ensure that it is always a list and can be modified within the function without raising errors.
