Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function lies in the use of the insert() method on the cmdline_args list. When using insert() method, it shifts the existing elements to the right, increasing their index, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Reason for the bug:

The bug occurs because the insert() method is used to add elements at the beginning of the cmdline_args list, but this may not be the intended behavior. It can lead to unexpected command line argument insertion, potentially causing errors or undesired behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we can use the append() method instead of the insert() to add elements at the end of the cmdline_args list. This will ensure that the elements are added in the correct order without affecting the existing elements.

Corrected code:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.append(main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.append('--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```
