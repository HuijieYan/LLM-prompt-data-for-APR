The bug seems to be caused by the `insert` method used on the `cmdline_args` list. This method is being used to add elements at the beginning of the list, but it's modifying the original `cmdline_args` list which is not desirable. This modification can lead to unexpected behavior when the `cmdline_args` list is used later in the function.

The corrected code for the `run` function is as follows:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None, worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()

    args = list(cmdline_args)  # Create a new list to avoid modifying the original cmdline_args

    if main_task_cls:
        args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')

    tasks = interface.parse(args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

In the corrected code, a new list `args` is created using the elements from `cmdline_args`. This new list is then modified as needed without affecting the original `cmdline_args` list. This approach ensures that the original `cmdline_args` list remains unchanged while still achieving the desired behavior within the `run` function.
