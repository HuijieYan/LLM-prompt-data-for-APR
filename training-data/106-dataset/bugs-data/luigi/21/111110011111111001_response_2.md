The error seems to be occurring because the `cmdline_args` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then there is an attempt to call the `insert` method on it. This suggests that the `cmdline_args` list is expected to have a value before the `insert` method is called on it.

The input parameters `main_task_cls` and `local_scheduler` are being used to modify the `cmdline_args` list, but since `cmdline_args` is set to `None` by default, this modification is causing the error.

To fix this issue, we should initialize `cmdline_args` as an empty list if it is None before attempting to modify it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    
    if cmdline_args is None:
        cmdline_args = []

    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)

```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle the modifications to `cmdline_args` without encountering the `NoneType` error.
