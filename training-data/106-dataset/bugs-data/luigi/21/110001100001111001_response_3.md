The code seems to have multiple functions with the same name `run` and `parse`. This is not permissible in Python as it does not support function overloading based on parameters. As a result, the previous `run` and `parse` functions are being replaced by the last defined ones.

To fix this issue, the function names or their signatures should be changed to avoid overwriting. Also, the parameters for the run function seem to be conflicting with each other. In the buggy code, the function has two different sets of parameters but both are optional, which might cause confusion in understanding the function's expected input.

Here is the corrected code with fixed function names and parameters:

```python
# Update function names to avoid conflicts
def run_cmdline(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None, worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please don't use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from command line using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)

def run_tasks(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory=None, override_defaults=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def parse_args(self, cmdline_args=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def parse_interface(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```

By adjusting the function names and signatures, the code should no longer have conflicts and the correct function will be called based on the given parameters.
