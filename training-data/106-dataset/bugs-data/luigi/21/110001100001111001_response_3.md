The error in the given function is due to the use of multiple functions with the same name, "run" and "parse", which causes confusion and ambiguity. This leads to the incorrect execution of these functions and causes bugs.

To fix this bug, the function names should be unique and not be repeated. The proper function signatures should be used and the input parameters should be handled accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None, worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse_tasks(cmdline_args)  # Modified to call a unique function "parse_tasks"
    return interface.run_tasks(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)  # Modified to call a unique function "run_tasks"
``` 

In this corrected code, the "parse" and "run" functions have been renamed to "parse_tasks" and "run_tasks" to avoid ambiguity and to make them unique. The calls to these functions have been updated accordingly.
