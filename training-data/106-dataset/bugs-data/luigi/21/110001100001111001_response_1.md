The bug in the given function is that it is defined twice in the code, and the first definition is being overridden by the second one. This will result in an AttributeError when the function is called, as the intended functionality from the first definition is lost.

To fix this, we need to remove the second definition and correct the first one to incorporate the runtime variable inputs and type. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    
    :return: the output value
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        if hasattr(main_task_cls, 'task_family'):
            cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the redundant function definitions and modified the first definition to incorporate the runtime variable inputs and type. We also added a check for the presence of the attribute 'task_family' in the main_task_cls, to avoid AttributeError.
