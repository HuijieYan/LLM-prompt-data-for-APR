Potential error location: 
The error may be occurring in the `cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)` line, as it seems to be trying to insert the task family name into the cmdline_args list, but the variable `main_task_cls` is actually an instance of the Register class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The main_task_cls variable is an instance of the Register class, but the code is trying to access the task_family attribute directly from it. This is likely causing the code to fail, as the task_family attribute should be accessed from the instance of the class, not the class itself.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of trying to access the task_family attribute directly from main_task_cls, it should be accessed from an instance of the main_task_cls class. If main_task_cls is an instance of a class, then an instance of that class should be created and its task_family attribute should be accessed.
2. If main_task_cls is supposed to be an instance, then the code where this variable is being assigned should be reviewed to ensure that it is being assigned correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        task_instance = main_task_cls()  # Create an instance of the class
        cmdline_args.insert(0, task_instance.task_family)  # Access task_family from the instance
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
