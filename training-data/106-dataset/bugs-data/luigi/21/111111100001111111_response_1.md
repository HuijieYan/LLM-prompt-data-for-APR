The potential error in the given function is that it is redefining the `run` function without using the correct decorator, causing the previous `run` function to be overridden.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `run` is being redefined without following the correct method signature. This leads to the previous `run` function being overridden and causes the code to become buggy.

To fix the bug, the code should be refactored to not redefine the `run` function and to update its behavior using the correct method signature.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_interface(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None, worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```

By renaming the function `run` to `run_interface`, it avoids redefining the existing `run` function and resolves the issue.
