The potential error in the given function is that there are multiple functions with the same name and same parameters in the code. This will cause confusion for the compiler to identify which function to call when the "run" function is invoked.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code defines multiple functions with the same name, but different parameters. This is not allowed in Python because it does not support function overloading, which is a feature in some other programming languages.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to rename the functions so that each function has a unique name. Additionally, the parameters for the functions should be adjusted to avoid confusion.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_cmdline(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
            worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
        """
        Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.
    
        Run from cmdline using argparse.
    
        :param cmdline_args:
        :param main_task_cls:
        :param worker_scheduler_factory:
        :param use_dynamic_argparse:
        :param local_scheduler:
        """
        if use_dynamic_argparse:
            interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
        else:
            interface = ArgParseInterface()
        if main_task_cls:
            cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
        if local_scheduler:
            cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
        tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
        return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```
