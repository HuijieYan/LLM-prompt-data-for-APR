Based on the error message, the issue is occurring due to the `cmdline_args` variable being set to None when the `luigi.run()` method is called with the `main_task_cls` parameter.

The potential error location within the `run` function is the conditional block where it checks if `main_task_cls` exists and then attempts to insert its `task_family` into `cmdline_args`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `luigi.run()` is called with `main_task_cls` as a parameter, `cmdline_args` is not provided, leading to it being set to None by default. This results in an AttributeError when trying to perform an operation on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional block to handle the case when `cmdline_args` is None. If `cmdline_args` is None, we create a new list with the `main_task_cls.task_family` and any additional arguments, otherwise, we add the `main_task_cls.task_family` to the existing `cmdline_args`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
        
    if cmdline_args is None:
        cmdline_args = [main_task_cls.task_family]
    else:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)

    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')

    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
```
