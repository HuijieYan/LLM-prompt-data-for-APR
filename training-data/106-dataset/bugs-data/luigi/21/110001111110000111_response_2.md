The error occurs in the `run` function of the `luigi/interface.py` file. The error message indicates that the `cmdline_args` parameter is None, and when trying to call the `insert` method on it, an AttributeError is raised. This suggests that `cmdline_args` should not be None when the `insert` method is called on it.

The bug occurs because the `cmdline_args` parameter is not handled properly when `main_task_cls` is provided. In the condition where `main_task_cls` is not None, the code attempts to modify `cmdline_args` by inserting the `task_family` of `main_task_cls` at the beginning of the list. However, since `cmdline_args` is None by default and it's not being assigned a value, this results in the AttributeError mentioned in the error message.

To fix this bug, the `cmdline_args` parameter should be initialized as an empty list if it's None, before attempting to modify it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def run(cmdline_args=None, main_task_cls=None,
        worker_scheduler_factory=None, use_dynamic_argparse=False, local_scheduler=False):
    """
    Please dont use. Instead use `luigi` binary.

    Run from cmdline using argparse.

    :param cmdline_args:
    :param main_task_cls:
    :param worker_scheduler_factory:
    :param use_dynamic_argparse:
    :param local_scheduler:
    """
    if cmdline_args is None:
        cmdline_args = []
        
    if use_dynamic_argparse:
        interface = DynamicArgParseInterface()
    else:
        interface = ArgParseInterface()
    if main_task_cls:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, main_task_cls.task_family)
    if local_scheduler:
        cmdline_args.insert(0, '--local-scheduler')
    tasks = interface.parse(cmdline_args)
    return interface.run(tasks, worker_scheduler_factory)
``` 

This corrected code initializes `cmdline_args` to an empty list if it's None, ensuring that the `insert` method can be called on it without raising an AttributeError.
