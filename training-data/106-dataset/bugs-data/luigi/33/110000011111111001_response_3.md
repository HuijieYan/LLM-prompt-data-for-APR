The error occurs because the `get_param_values` function has several issues such as iterating over positional arguments, handling optional arguments, and using defaults for missing values. These issues lead to incorrect behavior and raise exceptions in the provided test cases.

The potential error location is the part of the code where it handles positional arguments and fills in the optional arguments. It seems that the function is not handling these cases correctly, leading to the exceptions being raised during the test cases.

The buggy function is incorrectly handling the positional and optional arguments, resulting in exceptions being raised.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle positional and optional arguments and fill in the defaults for missing values. Additionally, it should not raise exceptions if the arguments are provided correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_param_values` function:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    result = {}

    # Fill in the positional arguments
    for i, (param_name, param_obj) in enumerate(params):
        if i < len(args):  # Fill in positional arguments
            result[param_name] = args[i]
        elif param_name in kwargs:  # Fill in optional arguments
            result[param_name] = kwargs[param_name]
        else:  # Use defaults for anything not filled in
            if not param_obj.has_task_value(cls.task_family, param_name):
                raise parameter.MissingParameterException(
                    f"{cls.task_family}[args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}]: requires the '{param_name}' parameter to be set"
                )
            result[param_name] = param_obj.task_value(cls.task_family, param_name)

    return [(param_name, result[param_name]) for param_name, _ in params]
```

This corrected code makes sure that positional and optional arguments are filled in correctly, and defaults are used for missing values. It also handles the cases where exceptions were previously being raised.

With these changes, the test cases should pass without raising any exceptions.
