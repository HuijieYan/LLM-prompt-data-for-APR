The potential error in the given function is that the `get_param_values` method is not properly defined within a class. It seems to be part of a class, but it is not correctly implemented as a class method.

The error occurs because the `get_param_values` method is defined without the `self` parameter, which is required for instance methods in Python. It also uses the `@classmethod` decorator, which is used to define class methods, but the method does not accept the required `cls` parameter.

To fix this issue, the `get_param_values` method should be properly defined as a class method within a class, and the `cls` parameter should be added to the method signature.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_param_values` method:

```python
class Task:
    @classmethod
    def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
        """
        Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

        :param cls: Class reference.
        :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
        :param args: positional arguments
        :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
        :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
        """
        result = {}

        params_dict = dict(params)

        task_name = cls.task_family

        # ... (rest of the original implementation)

        def list_to_tuple(x):
            """ Make tuples out of lists and sets to allow hashing """
            if isinstance(x, list) or isinstance(x, set):
                return tuple(x)
            else:
                return x
        # Sort it by the correct order and make a list
        return [(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]
```

By making these changes, the `get_param_values` method will be correctly defined as a class method within the `Task` class.
