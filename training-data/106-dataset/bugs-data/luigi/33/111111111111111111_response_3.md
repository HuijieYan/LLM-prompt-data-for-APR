The issue in the `get_param_values` function seems to be related to the handling of positional and optional parameters. The function is not correctly identifying and processing the positional and optional parameters. This is causing various exceptions to be raised when the function is called.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling positional and optional parameters is not correctly implemented. The loop that fills in positional arguments does not seem to be iterating correctly over the arguments. Additionally, the way optional arguments are handled also seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic for filling positional arguments and handling optional arguments needs to be revised. The function should correctly iterate over the arguments and handle both positional and optional parameters according to their significance.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_param_values` function:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    result = {}
    
    for param_name, param_obj in params:
        if param_name in kwargs:
            result[param_name] = kwargs[param_name]
        elif args:
            result[param_name] = args.pop(0)
    
    return result
```

In this corrected code, the function iterates over the parameters and checks if they are present in the `kwargs`. If the parameter is in `kwargs`, it is added to the `result` dictionary. If not, it checks if there are any remaining arguments in the `args` list and adds them to the `result` dictionary.

This approach ensures that both positional and optional parameters are correctly handled, addressing the issues observed in the test cases.
