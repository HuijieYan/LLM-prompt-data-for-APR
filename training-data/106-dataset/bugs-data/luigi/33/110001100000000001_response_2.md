The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to use the `task_family` attribute as if it were a property of the class, even though it was defined as a method earlier in the file. This will result in an AttributeError when trying to access `cls.task_family`.

The reason for the bug is that `task_family` is defined as a method, not a class attribute, so it cannot be accessed as `cls.task_family`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function to accept the `self` parameter instead of `cls` and access the `task_family` method through `self.task_family`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(self, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = self.task_family()

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly access the `task_family` method and proceed with the rest of its implementation.
