The problematic function `get_param_values` is expected to return a list of tuples containing parameter names and their corresponding values. However, it is currently returning a dictionary instead of a list of tuples, which does not match the expected output.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to iterate over the `params` list and use a dictionary `result` to store the parameter values. However, it does not construct the output as a list of tuples, as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly construct a list of tuples and return it as the result. We can use a list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_param_values` function:

```python
@classmethod
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    task_name = cls.task_family

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # construct a list of tuples
    param_values = [(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]

    return param_values
```

In this corrected code, the list comprehension `[(param_name, list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]` is used to construct the list of tuples. This list of tuples is then returned as the result of the function, satisfying the expected output.
