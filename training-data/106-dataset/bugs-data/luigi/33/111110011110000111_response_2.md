The bug is likely in the `get_param_values` method of the `Task` class. The error message indicates that the `UnknownParameterException` is being raised when the method is called, suggesting that the method is incorrectly handling the parameters.

The bug likely occurs because the method is incorrectly handling the positional and keyword arguments. It seems that the method is not correctly identifying the positional and keyword arguments, leading to incorrect exceptions being raised.

To fix the bug, the method needs to correctly handle the positional and keyword arguments, ensuring that the proper exceptions are raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_param_values` method:

```python
def get_param_values(cls, params, args, kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = cls.task_family()

    # Make sure to call task_family as a method to get the actual task family name

    # ... existing code ...

    # Sort it by the correct order and make a list
    return [(param_name, cls.list_to_tuple(result[param_name])) for param_name, param_obj in params]
```

It's important to correct the `task_name` assignment by calling `cls.task_family()` as a method to get the actual task family name. Also, `cls.list_to_tuple` should be used instead of `list_to_tuple` inside the method.

These corrections should address the issues and ensure that the `get_param_values` method handles the parameters correctly.
