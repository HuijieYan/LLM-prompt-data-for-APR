The `get_param_values` function is expecting a `cls` parameter representing the class, but in reality, it's being called as a instance method, so `self` should be used instead of `cls`.

Given the variable values and types, it is clear that `cls` is being used as a class method, however, it is called within the class itself which makes it an instance method instead of a class method. The error occurs due to the inconsistency in the usage of `cls` and `self` within the method definition.

To fix the issue, the function signature should be updated to use `self` instead of `cls` since it is being called from an instance of the class. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_param_values(self, params, args, kwargs):
    """
    Get the values of the parameters from the args and kwargs.

    :param params: list of (param_name, Parameter).
    :param args: positional arguments
    :param kwargs: keyword arguments.
    :returns: list of `(name, value)` tuples, one for each parameter.
    """
    result = {}

    params_dict = dict(params)

    task_name = self.task_family

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

In this corrected version of the function, `cls` has been replaced by `self` to ensure proper handling of the instance-specific data within the function.
