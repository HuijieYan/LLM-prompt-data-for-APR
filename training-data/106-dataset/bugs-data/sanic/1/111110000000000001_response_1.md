The potential error in the `register_named_middleware` function is that the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries have not been initialized before appending middleware to them. This will result in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize these dictionaries before appending middleware to them.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Sanic():
    def __init__(self):
        self.named_request_middleware = {}
        self.named_response_middleware = {}

    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
