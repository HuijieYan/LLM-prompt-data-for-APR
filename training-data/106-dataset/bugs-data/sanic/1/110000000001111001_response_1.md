Potential error location: The error in the provided function seems to occur because the function is not handling the "attach_to" parameter properly. It's not checking for both "request" and "response" cases, leading to the incorrect usage of the "named_request_middleware" and "named_response_middleware" dictionaries.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not contain an else block to handle cases where "attach_to" is neither "request" nor "response". As a result, it doesn't follow the correct logic for attaching middleware based on the "attach_to" value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add an else block to handle cases where "attach_to" is neither "request" nor "response".
2. Consider using an if-elif-else block to handle different values of "attach_to" in a more structured manner.
3. Ensure that the function correctly uses the "attach_to" parameter to assign middleware to the appropriate dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif to handle response case
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    else:  # Handle cases where "attach_to" is neither "request" nor "response"
        raise ValueError("attach_to must be either 'request' or 'response'")
```
