The test case "test_bp_middleware_order" sets up a blueprint with request and response middleware functions, then sends a request and checks the execution order of the middleware functions against the expected order.

The error message indicates that the order in which the response middleware functions are executed does not match the expected order. This suggests that the issue might be related to the registration or execution of the response middleware functions.

The buggy function "register_named_middleware" is responsible for registering the middleware for named request and response middleware.

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of response middleware registration in the "register_named_middleware" function. When a middleware is registered for the response, it should be added to the left of the deque instead of to the right, to ensure that it is executed in reverse order. This is likely causing the response middleware functions to be executed in the wrong order, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the "register_named_middleware" function should be modified to use "appendleft" instead of "append" when registering response middleware. This will ensure that the response middleware functions are executed in the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the "register_named_middleware" function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
