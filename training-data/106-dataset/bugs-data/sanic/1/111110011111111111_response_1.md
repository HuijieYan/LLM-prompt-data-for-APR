The bug occurs in the function `register_named_middleware` in the `Sanic` class. When `attach_to` is set to "response", the middleware is being added using the `append` method instead of the required `appendleft` method for the `deque`, which results in the middleware being executed in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, the `register_named_middleware` function needs to be modified to use the `appendleft` method when `attach_to` is "response" instead of `append`.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function in the `Sanic` class:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft` instead of `append` when `attach_to` is "response", the named response middleware will be added in reverse order as required, and the bug should be fixed.
