The test case test_bp_middleware_order is checking the order in which the middleware is executed. The expected order is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but the actual order observed is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]. This indicates that the "named response middleware" is being executed in the wrong order.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be the section where the middleware is appended to the named_response_middleware. Specifically, the issue lies in using append instead of appendleft when registering "response" middleware.

The bug occurred because the wrong method, append, was used to add the middleware to named_response_middleware. This caused the middlewares to be added to the right instead of the left, resulting in them being executed in the incorrect order.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the usage of append with appendleft when adding the middleware to named_response_middleware. This will ensure that the middleware is added to the left, which will result in the correct execution order.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using appendleft instead of append, the named_response_middleware will correctly store the middleware in the left, ensuring the correct execution order for "response" middleware.
