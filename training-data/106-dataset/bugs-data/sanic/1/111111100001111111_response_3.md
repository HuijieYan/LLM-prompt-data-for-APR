Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically when `attach_to` is "response". The function is using `append` instead of `appendleft` when adding middleware to the `named_response_middleware` deque.

Reasons behind the bug: When `attach_to` is "response", the middleware should be added to the left of the deque in reverse order. However, the function is currently using `append` which adds the middleware to the right end of the deque.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the function should use the `appendleft` method instead of `append` when `attach_to` is "response".

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/sanic_1/sanic/app.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
