Potential error location:
The issue occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function, particularly in the section where `attach_to` is checked to determine whether to add the middleware to `self.named_request_middleware` or `self.named_response_middleware`. The use of `append` to add the middleware is incorrect when `attach_to` is "response".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `append` method adds the new middleware to the right side of the deque, which causes it to be executed in the wrong order. For "response" middlewares, they are supposed to be added to the left in reverse.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when `attach_to` is "response". This will add the new middleware to the left side of the deque, ensuring that it is executed in the correct order.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft for response middleware
```
