Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the loop where the middleware is added to the named_request_middleware or named_response_middleware, as the code currently does not check if the middleware is already present in the deque.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not check if the middleware is already present in the deque before appending it.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by adding a check to see if the middleware is already present in the deque before appending it.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
