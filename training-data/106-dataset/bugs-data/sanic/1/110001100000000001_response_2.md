Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the conditionals for "attach_to". It should either use elif for the second condition or use a separate if statement, as both conditions can be true simultaneously.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the current code does not handle the case where "attach_to" is "response" and a route name is present in both "named_request_middleware" and "named_response_middleware". This leads to middleware being added to both containers even when it's supposed to be conditional based on the "attach_to" parameter.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
We can either use elif for the second condition to ensure only one block is executed, or we can use separate if statements to handle each case independently.

Corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":  # Changed to elif
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
In the corrected code, we added the "elif" statement to ensure that only one block is executed based on the value of "attach_to". This prevents the middleware from being added to both "named_request_middleware" and "named_response_middleware" when it's only meant to be added to one.
