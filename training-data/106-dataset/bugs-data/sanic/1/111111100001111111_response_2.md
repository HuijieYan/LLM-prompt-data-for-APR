The bug in the provided function is that when registering a "response" middleware, it uses `append()` instead of `appendleft()` to add the middleware to the left in reverse. This causes the named response middleware to be executed in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, the function `register_named_middleware` should use `appendleft()` instead of `append()` when attaching to "response".

Here is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

The corrected code uses `appendleft()` when attaching to "response" to ensure that the named response middleware is executed in the correct order.
