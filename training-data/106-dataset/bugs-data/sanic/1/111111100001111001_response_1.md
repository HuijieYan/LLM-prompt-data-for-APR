Potential error location: The bug could be in the way the `register_named_middleware` function is handling the `attach_to` parameter and adding the middleware to the appropriate middleware dictionary.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function is not correctly distinguishing between whether the middleware should be added to the request middleware or the response middleware.
2. The logic for adding the middleware to the middleware dictionaries is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect addition of middlewares.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the value of the `attach_to` parameter and add the middleware to the corresponding middleware dictionary based on that value.
2. Use a conditional statement to separate the logic for adding middlewares to request and response middleware dictionaries.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
