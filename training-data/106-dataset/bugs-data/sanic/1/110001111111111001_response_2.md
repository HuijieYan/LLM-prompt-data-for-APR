The test case `test_bp_middleware_order` is intended to create a blueprint with middleware for both request and response, set up a route, and then call the route to check the middleware execution order. Based on the error message, it seems that the order of execution is not as expected.

The buggy function is `register_named_middleware` in the given file. This function is responsible for registering middleware for named routes based on the `attach_to` parameter. The bug is likely related to how middleware is being appended to the queues associated with each named route.

The bug occurs because the middleware is being added to the response queue regardless of the value of `attach_to`. This results in response middleware being added when it should not be.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding middleware to the response queue should be placed within the `if attach_to == "response"` block. This will ensure that the middleware is only added to the response queue when `attach_to` is "response".

Below is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif instead of if
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

By using `elif` for the `attach_to == "response"` condition, the response middleware will only be added to the response queue when applicable. This should resolve the bug and ensure that middleware is added based on the correct `attach_to` condition.
