Potential Error Location:

The issue lies in how the function is handling the attachment of the middleware to either the request or the response. It is correctly checking if the attachment is to the request or response, but it's not handling the response middleware properly.

Reason for the Bug:

The function is only considering the 'response' middleware for the response, which is causing the issue. It should also consider the `attach_to` variable for both 'request' and 'response' cases.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:

We need to modify the function to handle both 'request' and 'response' cases properly. We should check the value of `attach_to` and then update either `self.named_request_middleware` or `self.named_response_middleware` accordingly.

The Corrected Code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    for _rn in route_names:
        if attach_to == "request":
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
