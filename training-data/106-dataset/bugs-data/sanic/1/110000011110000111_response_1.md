The error message indicates that the response middleware functions are executed in the wrong order. This likely means that there is an issue with how the response middleware is being registered and executed.

The potential error location within the provided function is in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section that handles `attach_to == "response"`. The issue is likely related to how the response middleware is being appended to the deque.

The bug occurs because the response middleware should be added to the left of the deque in reverse order. However, the original code simply appends the response middleware, causing them to execute in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the response middleware should be added to the left of the deque using the `appendleft` method instead of `append` in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
from collections import deque

def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using the `appendleft` method for response middleware, we ensure that the middleware is added to the left of the deque, resulting in the correct execution order.
