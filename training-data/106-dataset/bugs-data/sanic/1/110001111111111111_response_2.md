The error in the `register_named_middleware` function is caused by using the `append` method instead of `appendleft` when registering a "response" middleware. This results in the response middleware being added in the wrong order, causing it to execute in the wrong order.

To fix this issue, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when `attach_to` is "response". This will ensure that the "response" middleware is added to the left in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middlewa[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use appendleft for "response" middleware
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this correction, the "response" middleware will be added in the correct order, ensuring that it executes as expected in the reverse order.

By applying this fix, the `assert order == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` statement in the test case should pass without any assertion error.
