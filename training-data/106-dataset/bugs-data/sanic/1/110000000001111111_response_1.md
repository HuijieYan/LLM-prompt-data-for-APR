Potential error location:
The issue is in the `register_named_middleware` function where response middleware should be added to the left in reverse using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the response middleware should be executed in reverse order, but in the current implementation, the `append()` method is used, which adds the middleware to the right.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by using the `appendleft()` method to add the response middleware in reverse order.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
