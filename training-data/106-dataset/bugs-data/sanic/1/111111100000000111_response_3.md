The error is occurring in the `register_named_middleware` function. The bug is related to the use of `append` instead of `appendleft` when registering a "response" middleware. This causes the middleware to be added in the wrong order.

The reason for the bug is that when adding a "response" middleware, it is supposed to be added to the left in reverse. Using `append` adds the middleware to the right, resulting in the incorrect order of execution.

To fix this bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when attaching middleware to the "response".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
