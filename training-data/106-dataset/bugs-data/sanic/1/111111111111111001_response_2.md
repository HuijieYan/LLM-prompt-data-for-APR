The error occurs in the order of the responses due to the incorrect insertion of the middleware in the `named_response_middleware`. This causes the responses to be processed in the wrong order.

The bug is in the `register_named_middleware` method of the `Sanic` class where the middleware is being incorrectly added to the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `register_named_middleware` method to correctly add the middleware to the appropriate dictionary based on the `attach_to` parameter. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct order of middleware execution is maintained for requests and responses.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        for _rn in route_names:
            if attach_to == "request":
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the middleware at the correct position (avoiding appending at the end)
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
            elif attach_to == "response":
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the middleware at the correct position (avoiding appending at the end)
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft` instead of `append`, we ensure that the middleware is correctly inserted at the beginning of the deque, maintaining the correct order of middleware execution for both requests and responses.

After making these changes, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
