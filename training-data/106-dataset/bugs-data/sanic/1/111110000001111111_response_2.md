The bug in the provided code is that when registering a "response" middleware, they are supposed to be added to the left in reverse. The correct behavior is to use `appendleft()` instead of `append()`. 

The potential error location within the code is in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where the middleware is added to either the `named_request_middleware` or `named_response_middleware`.

The bug occurred because the code used `append()` instead of `appendleft()` when registering "response" middleware, which caused the middleware to be added in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the code should use `appendleft()` when attaching the middleware to the `named_response_middleware`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected signature of the function in this class
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
