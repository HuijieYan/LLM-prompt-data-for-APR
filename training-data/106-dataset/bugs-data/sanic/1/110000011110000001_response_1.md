The error message from the test function indicates that the order in which the middleware functions are being called is not as expected. The test is failing because the order of response middleware functions is different from the expected order. This implies that there might be an issue with how the middleware functions are being registered with the routes.

Potential error location:
The issue may lie in the `register_named_middleware` function, particularly in the logic for attaching middleware to the "response" route.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the code is not appropriately attaching the middleware functions to the "response" route. This is resulting in the incorrect order of execution when the middleware functions are called for the "response" route.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the middleware functions are correctly attached to the "response" route.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected register_named_middleware function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use `appendleft` to maintain the order
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use `appendleft` to maintain the order
```

By using `appendleft` in the deque, we can ensure that the middleware functions are added in the correct order for the "response" route, resulting in the expected order of execution in the test function.
