The potential error in the provided function is in the conditional statements where 'attach_to' is checked. The function checks if 'attach_to' is equal to 'request' or 'response' and then proceeds accordingly. However, the issue lies in the fact that the function does not have any checks for cases where 'attach_to' is neither 'request' nor 'response'. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for cases where 'attach_to' is neither 'request' nor 'response'. We can simply raise an error or return a message indicating that the value of 'attach_to' is invalid.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for 'attach_to'. It should be either 'request' or 'response'.")
``` 

In the corrected code, we've added an 'else' statement to raise an error if the value of 'attach_to' is neither 'request' nor 'response'. This will help in handling cases where an invalid value is passed for 'attach_to'.
