The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional blocks for 'request' and 'response'. 

The bug occurs because the function has conditional blocks for both 'request' and 'response', but the logic inside the blocks only modifies either `self.named_request_middleware` or `self.named_response_middleware`. As a result, if the `attach_to` parameter is 'response', the logic inside the 'request' block is unnecessary and vice versa.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks should be independent of each other and not contain duplicate logic. 

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

By using the `elif` statement for 'response', we ensure that only the appropriate logic is executed based on the value of `attach_to`.
