The error message from the test function indicates that the order in which the middleware is executed is incorrect. It shows that the response middleware is executed in the wrong order, which causes the test to fail.

The potential error location in the `register_named_middleware` function is when adding the middleware to `named_response_middleware`. The issue lies within the conditional block for `attach_to == "response"` where the middleware is being appended instead of being appended in reverse order as required.

The bug occurs because the `register_named_middleware` function is not handling the `attach_to == "response"` case correctly. When registering a "response" middleware, it should be added in reverse order using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function needs to be modified to properly add the "response" middleware in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, when `attach_to` is "response", the middleware is added using `appendleft()` to ensure the correct order of execution.
