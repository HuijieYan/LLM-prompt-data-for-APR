The error message indicates that the response middleware functions are being executed in the wrong order. This is likely due to a copy-paste error in the `register_named_middleware` function.

The bug occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where middleware is added to the `named_response_middleware`. It appears that the `append` method is used to add the middleware to the deque, which should actually be using the `appendleft` method to add the middleware to the left of the deque in reverse order.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified so that the `append` method is replaced with `appendleft` for `attach_to == "response"` condition in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

By replacing `append` with `appendleft`, the response middleware functions should now be executed in the correct order.
