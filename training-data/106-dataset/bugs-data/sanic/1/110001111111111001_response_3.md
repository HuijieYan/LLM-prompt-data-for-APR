The error in the test case seems to be related to the order of middleware execution. The middleware functions are not executing in the expected order, causing the test to fail.

The buggy function is `register_named_middleware`. It is supposed to add middleware functions to the appropriate request or response middleware deque based on the `attach_to` parameter.

The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `register_named_middleware` function. It's failing to correctly add the middleware functions to the appropriate deques for request and response middleware.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to correct the logic for adding middleware to the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` deques based on the `attach_to` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, the middleware is inserted at the beginning of the deque for both request and response middleware. This ensures that the middleware functions are executed in the correct order, as expected by the test case.
