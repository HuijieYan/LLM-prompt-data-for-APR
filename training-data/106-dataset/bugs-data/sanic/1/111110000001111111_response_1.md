The issue is related to the order in which named response middleware is executed. When registering a "response" middleware, they are supposed to be added to the left in reverse. In the `register_named_middleware` function, the `append` method is being used, which adds the middleware to the right. This results in an incorrect order of execution for named response middleware.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function should use the `appendleft` method instead of `append` when attaching middleware to the "response".

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

By using `appendleft` instead of `append` for the named response middleware, it ensures that the order of execution is reversed, as intended. This should fix the issue with the incorrect order of named response middleware execution.
