The bug is located in the `register_named_middleware` function. The bug occurs when registering a "response" middleware, as the middleware is added using `append` instead of `appendleft`, causing the middleware to be executed in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `appendleft` method instead of `append` when registering the "response" middleware.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
