The error occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function within the `Sanic` class due to the ordering of middleware when `attach_to` is set to `'response'`. The error message from the test indicates that the ordering of the middleware functions is not as expected, specifically for the `'response'` middleware.

The bug occurs because the middleware functions are not being added in the correct sequence. When `attach_to` is `'response'`, the middleware functions should be appended to the `self.named_response_middleware[_rn]` in the order they are defined, but this is not happening.

To fix the bug, you should modify the `register_named_middleware` function to correctly append the middleware functions to `self.named_response_middleware[_rn]` in the order they are defined, when `attach_to` is set to `'response'.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        for _rn in route_names:
            if attach_to == "request":
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
            if attach_to == "response":
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

In this corrected version, middleware functions for both `'request'` and `'response'` are appended to the appropriate deque in the order they are processed.
