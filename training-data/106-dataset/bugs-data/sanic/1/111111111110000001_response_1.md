The error message indicates that the order in which the middleware functions are being called is not as expected. This suggests that the `register_named_middleware` function is not correctly assigning the middleware functions to request and response routes.

The potential error is within the `register_named_middleware` function, where the middleware functions are not being correctly added to the `named_request_middleware` or `named_response_middleware` dictionaries based on the `attach_to` parameter.

The bug occurs because the middleware functions are not being properly associated with the request or response routes. This results in the incorrect order of middleware execution.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function needs to correctly assign the middleware functions to the corresponding request or response routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft to maintain the correct order
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif to explicitly check for "response"
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft to maintain the correct order
```

By using `appendleft` to add the middleware functions to the deque, the correct order of execution for both request and response middleware should be maintained.
