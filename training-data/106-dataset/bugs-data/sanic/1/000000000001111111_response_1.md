The issue is related to the order of execution for named response middleware. The bug occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function where the `append` method is used for adding middleware to the `named_response_middleware` instead of `appendleft`. This causes the middleware to be added in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `appendleft` method instead of `append` when attaching middleware to the `named_response_middleware`.

Here is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

With this correction, the named response middleware will be added to the left, ensuring that the correct order of execution is maintained.
