The bug is related to the `register_named_middleware` function in the Sanic library, where named response middleware is being added in the wrong order. This is causing the named response middleware to execute in the wrong order.

The potential error location within the function is the part where the middleware is being added to the named_response_middleware using the `append` method, which should be `appendleft` to add it to the left in reverse.

The bug occurred because when registering a "response" middleware, it should be added to the left in reverse, in order to execute in the correct order. However, the original code incorrectly uses the `append` method, which adds the middleware to the right instead of the left.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be replaced with the `appendleft` method when registering "response" middleware in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Corrected method
```

With this correction, the named response middleware will be added to the left in reverse, ensuring that it executes in the correct order.
