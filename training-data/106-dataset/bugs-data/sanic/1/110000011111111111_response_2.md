The test function `test_bp_middleware_order(app)` in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/sanic_1/tests/test_blueprints.py` is failing with the error message "assert order == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]".

The buggy function is `register_named_middleware` and it appears to be the cause of the failure. The error message and the test function indicate that the order of execution of named response middleware is incorrect.

The issue occurs because the `register_named_middleware` function does not correctly handle the order of execution for named response middleware. When attaching named response middleware, it should be added to the left in reverse, but the current implementation uses `append` instead of `appendleft`. This leads to the incorrect order of execution as observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function should be modified to use `appendleft` instead of `append` when attaching named response middleware.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                # Use appendleft to maintain the correct order of execution
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this correction, the named response middleware will be added to the left in reverse order, ensuring that they are executed in the correct sequence.

The corrected implementation will address the failing test case and ensure that the named response middleware is executed in the expected order.
