Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring within the `register_named_middleware` function in the `Sanic` class. The ordering of the middleware is incorrect, which is causing the test to fail.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug is caused by the incorrect ordering of the middleware. The current implementation does not consider the ordering of middleware based on the route names and the attachment type (request or response).

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `register_named_middleware` function to maintain the correct order of middleware based on the route names and the attachment type.
2. Update the logic to ensure that the middleware is appended in the correct order based on the route names and attachment type.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                # Append the middleware based on the order of the route names
                index = route_names.index(_rn)
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].insert(index, middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                # Append the middleware based on the order of the route names
                index = route_names.index(_rn)
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].insert(index, middleware)
```

By using the `insert` method of the `deque` data structure, the corrected code ensures that the middleware is added to the correct index based on the order of the route names, thereby fixing the bug related to middleware ordering.
