The buggy function `register_named_middleware` is not working as expected due to the incorrect initialization and update of the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries depending on the value of `attach_to` parameter.

The buggy function tries to add middleware functions to the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries based on the value of `attach_to` parameter. However, it does not handle the case where the `attach_to` parameter has a value other than "request" or "response".

The correction involves updating the conditional statements to include an `else` block for handling cases when `attach_to` is neither "request" nor "response".

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    for _rn in route_names:
        if attach_to == "request":
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        else:
            raise ValueError("attach_to parameter must be 'request' or 'response'")
```

By implementing these changes, the function should handle cases where `attach_to` is neither "request" nor "response" and raises a ValueError in such instances.

After the correction, the test function `test_bp_middleware_order` should execute without any assertion errors.
