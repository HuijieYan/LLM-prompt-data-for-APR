The error message indicates that the order of the middlewares applied to the response is incorrect. The expected order is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but the actual order is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4].

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `register_named_middleware` method of the `Sanic` class. It seems that the order in which the middlewares are added to the named request and response middleware is not being maintained correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `register_named_middleware` method is not correctly maintaining the order of middlewares for request and response.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` method should maintain the order in which middlewares are added to the named request and response middleware.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Append the middleware to the left (maintains order)

        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Append the middleware to the left (maintains order)
```

By using `appendleft` instead of `append`, we ensure that the order of middlewares is maintained. This should fix the bug and result in the correct order of middlewares being applied to the response.
