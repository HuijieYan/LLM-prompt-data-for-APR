The potential error location in the code is in the if statement for "attach_to" being "response". It seems that the code is intended to handle different types of middleware for different route names, but there is an issue with adding middleware to the named_response_middleware if attach_to is "response".

The bug occurs because the code does not account for the case where the named_response_middleware dictionary has not been initialized. This results in a KeyError when trying to add middleware to it.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if the named_response_middleware dictionary for the specified route name exists, and if not, initialize it before adding the middleware.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
