The buggy function `register_named_middleware` is designed to register middleware for requests and responses based on the specified route names. The problem is that if the `attach_to` parameter is "response", it should be adding the middleware to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary, but it is currently adding it to `self.named_request_middleware` regardless of the value of `attach_to`.

The corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function is as follows:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif to properly handle response middleware
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, an `elif` statement is used to properly handle the case where `attach_to` is "response". This ensures that the middleware is added to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary when `attach_to` is "response".
