The bug is likely located in the `register_named_middleware` function. When middleware is being added for the "response", the `append` method is being used instead of `appendleft`. This causes the middleware to be added in the wrong order.

The order of execution for named response middleware should be the reverse of the order they were added. But currently, the code is only adding middleware to the end of the list in the `self.named_response_middleware[_rn]` deque.

To fix this bug, you can update the "response" part of the `register_named_middleware` function to use the `appendleft` method instead of `append`:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

By making this change, the named response middleware will be added to the left of the deque, ensuring the correct order of execution. This should address the bug and ensure that the named response middleware is executed in the correct order.
