The error message from the test case indicates that the order of execution of middleware in the response phase is incorrect. This suggests that there is an issue with the registration of middleware for the response phase.

Upon analysis, the buggy function 'register_named_middleware' is responsible for registering named middleware for both requests and responses. The bug seems to be in the 'register_named_middleware' function, specifically in the conditional blocks for 'attach_to' being "response".

The reason behind the bug is that the function incorrectly registers middleware for response phases. There seems to be an issue with the logic that causes the response phase middleware to be appended in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for 'attach_to' being "response" needs to be modified to correct the registration of middleware for the response phase.

Below is the corrected function with the issue fixed:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Modified conditional to elif
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

By modifying the conditional block for 'attach_to' being "response" to an 'elif' statement, the registration of middleware for the response phase will be corrected. The corrected code ensures that middleware is appended in the correct order for the response phase, resolving the bug.
