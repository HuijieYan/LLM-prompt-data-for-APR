The bug is in the `register_named_middleware` function where the `append` method is being used instead of `appendleft` when attaching to "response", causing the named response middleware to be added to the right instead of the left in reverse order. This results in the incorrect execution order of the named response middleware.

To fix the bug, we need to use `appendleft` instead of `append` when attaching to "response" in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected register_named_middleware function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
