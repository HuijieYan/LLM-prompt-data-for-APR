The error message indicates that the response middleware is not executing in the expected order. The buggy function `register_named_middleware` is the likely location of the error.

The reason for the bug is that the `append()` method is used to add named response middleware, which adds the middleware to the right, causing them to execute in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the `appendleft()` method should be used instead of `append()` when adding named response middleware. This will ensure that the middleware is added to the left and executed in the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
from collections import deque

def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft()` for named response middleware, the middleware will be added to the left and executed in the correct order.
