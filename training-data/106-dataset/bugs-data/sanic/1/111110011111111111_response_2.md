The bug is likely located in the section of the code where the middleware is being added to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary. When attaching middleware to the "response", the middleware should be added to the left in reverse, so the `appendleft()` method should be used instead of `append()`.

The reason behind the bug is that the middleware for the response is added in the incorrect order, resulting in the wrong execution order. This is evident from the error message where the expected order of execution is different from the actual order.

To fix the bug, update the `register_named_middleware` function to use the `appendleft()` method when attaching middleware to the "response" instead of `append()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this change, the middleware will be added to the left in reverse order when attaching to the "response", ensuring the correct execution order.
