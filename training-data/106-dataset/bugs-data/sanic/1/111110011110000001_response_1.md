The error message is indicating that the order in which the middleware functions are being executed is incorrect. 

The potential error in the provided `register_named_middleware` function is that middleware functions for requests and responses are not being stored or executed in the expected order.

The bug is occurring because the middleware is being stored and executed in the order in which it is added, regardless of whether it is a request middleware or response middleware.

To fix this bug, we need to store and execute request middleware and response middleware separately, and execute them in the correct order.

The corrected function `register_named_middleware` is as follows:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            # Insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque to maintain the correct order
            self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif instead of another if statement for better logic
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            # Insert the new middleware at the end of the deque to maintain the correct order
            self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

In this corrected code, if the `attach_to` parameter is "request", the new middleware is inserted at the beginning of the deque to maintain the correct order. If the `attach_to` parameter is "response", the middleware is added at the end of the deque to maintain the correct order.
