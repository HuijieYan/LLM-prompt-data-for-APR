1. The test_bp_middleware_order function is attempting to test the order of execution of middleware functions within a Sanic blueprint. The error message indicates that the order of execution of the middleware functions does not match the expected order.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the register_named_middleware method of the Sanic class.

3. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of middleware attachment to "response". The bug may be related to appending middlewares to the named_response_middleware dictionary, which results in an incorrect order of execution.

4. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic in the register_named_middleware method to correctly attach middlewares to "response" and maintain the desired order of execution.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic register_named_middleware method:

```python
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Changed to appendleft to maintain order
        elif attach_to == "response":  # Changed to elif for proper if-else logic
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Changed to appendleft to maintain order
```

By updating the register_named_middleware method with the corrected logic, the middleware attachment should maintain the correct order of execution, resolving the issue observed in the test case.
