The error message from the test function indicates that the order in which the response middlewares are executed is incorrect. The expected order is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but the actual order is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]. This suggests that the bug is likely located in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where response middlewares are being added.

The reason behind this bug is that the `append` method is used to add response middlewares, which adds the middleware to the right, when it should be added to the left in reverse order.

To fix this bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` method when adding response middlewares.

Here is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

In this corrected code, the `appendleft` method is used to add response middlewares, which ensures they are added in reverse order.
