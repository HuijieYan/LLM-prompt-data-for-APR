The error occurred because the `register_named_middleware` function does not correctly handle the order of execution for named response middleware. It uses `append()` instead of `appendleft()` when adding middleware to the response deque. This results in the middleware being added in the wrong order, leading to the incorrect execution sequence.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `register_named_middleware` function to use `appendleft()` instead of `append()` when adding named middleware to the `named_response_middleware` deque. This will ensure that the middleware is added to the left in reverse order, as intended for named response middleware.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this correction, the named response middleware will be added to the left in reverse order, leading to the expected behavior in the tests.
