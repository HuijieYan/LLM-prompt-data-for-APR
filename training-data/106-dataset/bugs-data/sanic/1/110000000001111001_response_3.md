The bug in the provided function is that when `attach_to` is "response", the function is still modifying `self.named_request_middleware` instead of `self.named_response_middleware`.

To fix this bug, we need to separate the logic for "request" and "response" middleware registration.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

Now the function correctly handles "request" and "response" middleware registrations separately.
