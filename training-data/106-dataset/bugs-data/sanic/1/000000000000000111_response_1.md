Potential error location: The error occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function on line 5, where `middleware` is appended using `append` instead of `appendleft` for named response middleware. This causes the named response middleware to be executed in the wrong order.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because `append` adds the new middleware to the right, causing it to be executed in the wrong order. For named response middleware, it should be added to the left in reverse order.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by using the `appendleft` method instead of `append` when adding named response middleware.

Corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
In the corrected code, `appendleft` method is used to add the named response middleware to the left in reverse order, ensuring that it is executed in the correct order.
