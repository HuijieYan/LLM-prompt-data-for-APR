Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the line "self['headers'][name] = value" where 'self' seems to be a dictionary-like object but is being used as if it were a dictionary.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The 'self' variable is being used as if it were a dictionary, but it is not clear what type of object 'self' is referring to. It seems like 'self' should be an instance of a class, and 'headers' should be an attribute of that class, but it is not being accessed correctly. Also, the code is trying to access 'self' as if it were a dictionary (e.g., self['headers'][name]), which is incorrect. Additionally, the break statement inside the for loop does not actually exit the loop as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of object that 'self' refers to and ensure that it has a 'headers' attribute.
2. Change the way the 'headers' attribute is accessed based on the type of object 'self' is.
3. Use a different control structure (e.g., if/else) to achieve the desired behavior of skipping certain headers based on their prefixes.

Corrected Code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    # Assuming 'self' is an instance of a class, and it has a 'headers' attribute
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        ignore_header = False
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                ignore_header = True
                break
        if not ignore_header:
            self.headers[name] = value
```
