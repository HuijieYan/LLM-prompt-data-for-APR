The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error is due to the `decode` method being called on the `value` without checking if it is `None` or not. This is evident from the stack trace and the runtime value of the input parameters.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This can be achieved using an `if` condition to check if `value` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.
    
    :type request_headers: dict
    
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, an `if` condition is added to check if the `value` is not `None` before decoding it. If the `value` is `None`, it is not decoded, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
