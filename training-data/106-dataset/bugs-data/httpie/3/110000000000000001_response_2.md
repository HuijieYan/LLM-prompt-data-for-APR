Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely with the line `self['headers'][name] = value`. It seems like `self` should be an instance of a class with a `headers` attribute, but it is not being accessed correctly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The code is trying to update the session headers with the request headers, but it is not accessing the `headers` attribute correctly from the `self` object. In addition, there is also an issue with the decoding of the value from utf8.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change `self['headers'][name]` to `self.headers[name]` assuming `self` is an instance of a class with a `headers` attribute.
2. Handle the decoding of the value from utf8 correctly.
3. Ensure that the `SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES` variable is defined and accessible within the scope of this function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        value = value.decode('utf8')  # Assuming decoding is necessary
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:  # Assuming SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES is defined
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self.headers[name] = value
```
In this corrected code, the `headers` attribute is accessed using dot notation `self.headers` and the decoding of the value is handled. Additionally, the assumption is made that the variable `SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES` is accessible within the scope of this function.
