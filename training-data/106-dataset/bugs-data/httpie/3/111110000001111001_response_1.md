The error in the provided function is that it is trying to decode the value from the `request_headers` dictionary using `value.decode('utf8')`. This is causing an error because decoding is not applicable to all types of values in the dictionary.

The reason for the bug is that the function is assuming that all the values in the `request_headers` dictionary are of type `bytes` and need to be decoded using UTF-8. However, not all values in the dictionary may be of type `bytes`.

To fix this bug, we need to check the type of the value before applying the `decode` method. If the value is of type `bytes`, then we can decode it using UTF-8, otherwise, we can keep it as it is.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        # Check if the value is of type bytes
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            # If the value is bytes, then decode it using UTF-8
            value = value.decode('utf8')

        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the value is of type `bytes` using `isinstance(value, bytes)`. If it is, then we decode it using UTF-8. Otherwise, we keep it as it is. This will ensure that the function works correctly without trying to decode non-byte values.
