Potential error location: The line "value = value.decode('utf8')" is the potential source of the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The "decode" method is being called on the "value" without checking if "value" is a string, leading to the "NoneType" error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if "value" is a string before trying to decode it, and handle the case where it is not a string.
2. Update the logic to handle non-string values appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, str):
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
