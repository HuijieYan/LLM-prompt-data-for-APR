The error is occurring because the `decode` method is being called on a value that is `None`, causing an `AttributeError`. The specific case causing the error is when the `Accept-Encoding` header is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. Additionally, the variable `name` is being used incorrectly. Instead of `self['headers'][name]`, it should be `self['headers'][name] = value`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
