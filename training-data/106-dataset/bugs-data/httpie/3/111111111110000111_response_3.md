The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error message specifically mentions that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` which implies that the `value` variable within the function is `None` and cannot be decoded.

The error potentially occurs when the `request_headers` dictionary contains a value of `None` for a particular header. This can happen due to incorrect handling of the headers, such as when a header is expected but not provided.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the value is not None before decoding it using the `decode` method. Once we confirm that the value is not None, then we can proceed with decoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the `if value is not None` check before decoding the value, we prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring when `value` is `None`.
