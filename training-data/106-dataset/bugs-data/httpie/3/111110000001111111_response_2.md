Potential error location: The line `value = value.decode('utf8')` within the `update_headers` function is causing the AttributeError because it is trying to decode the value even if it is None.

Reasons behind the bug: The code does not check if the value is None before trying to decode it, leading to the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Add a check to ensure that the value is not None before attempting to decode it.
2. Also, check if the value is a bytes object before attempting to decode it.

Corrected code:

```python
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.
    
        :type request_headers: dict
    
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if value is not None and isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue
    
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
