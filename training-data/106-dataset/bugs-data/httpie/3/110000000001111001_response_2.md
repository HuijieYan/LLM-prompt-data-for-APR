Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` as it tries to decode the value even when it may not be in bytes format.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The error occurs because the value in the `request_headers` dictionary may not always be in bytes format. The code assumes that it is and attempts to decode it, leading to a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the value is already in string format before attempting to decode it. If it's not, then skip the decoding step.
- Use a try-except block to handle the TypeError that may occur during the decoding process.

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if the value is in bytes format
            try:
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            except:
                pass  # Handle the decode error
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we check if the value is in bytes format before attempting to decode it. If it's in bytes format, then we try to decode it and handle any potential decoding errors. This approach ensures that the function can handle both string and bytes input for the request headers.
