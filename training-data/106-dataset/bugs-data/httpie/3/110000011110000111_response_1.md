1. The test case "test_download_in_session" is trying to download a file using the HTTPie library and the session "test". However, during the execution of the test case, it encounters an AttributeError related to the "decode" method.

2. The potential error location is within the "update_headers" method of the session class, where the value of the request headers is being decoded. Specifically, the "value" variable is being decoded without checking if it is None, leading to the AttributeError.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the "value" of a header is None, causing the AttributeError when trying to decode the None object.

4. To fix the bug, a conditional check should be added to ensure that the "value" is not None before attempting to decode it. If the value is None, it should be handled appropriately, for example, by skipping it or setting a default value.

5. Corrected code for the "update_headers" method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is None:
            continue
        value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, a check for None value is added before decoding the header value, preventing the AttributeError. If the header value is None, it is skipped, and the loop moves to the next header.
