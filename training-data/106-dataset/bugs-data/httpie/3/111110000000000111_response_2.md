The error is occurring on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` inside the `update_headers` function. This error is happening because the `value` is `None` in some cases, and you cannot call the `decode` method on a `None` object.

To fix this bug, you should first check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, you should also consider handling other potential edge cases related to the `request_headers` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With these changes, the code will check if `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
