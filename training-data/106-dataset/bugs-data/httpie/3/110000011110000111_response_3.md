The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object does not have the attribute 'decode', suggesting that the variable 'value' is None when it is being decoded.

Looking at the `update_headers` function, the potential error location is in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the value for the 'User-Agent' key is None, and the function does not handle the case where the value is None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

This code includes a check to ensure that the value is not None before attempting to decode it. If the value is None, it will be skipped and not added to the session headers.
