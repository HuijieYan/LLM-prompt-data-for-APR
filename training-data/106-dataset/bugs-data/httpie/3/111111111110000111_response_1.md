The error occurs in the function `update_headers` of the `Session` class. The `AttributeError` is raised on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` which suggests that the `value` is `None` at that point.

The reason for the bug is that the `value` extracted from `request_headers` is `None`, so calling `decode` on it raises the `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If it is `None`, we should skip the decoding step.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
                value = value.decode('utf8')
                if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                    continue

                for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                    if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                        break
                else:
                    self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check `if value is not None`, we ensure that we don't attempt to decode a `None` value. This change should fix the `AttributeError` and prevent the bug from occurring.
