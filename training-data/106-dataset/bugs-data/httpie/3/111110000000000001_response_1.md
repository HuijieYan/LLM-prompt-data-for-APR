Potential error location: The line `value = value.decode('utf8')` is attempting to decode the headers using 'utf8', which might not be necessary if the headers are already in UTF-8 format.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is attempting to decode the headers using 'utf8' unnecessarily, which can cause errors if the headers are already in the correct format.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the headers need to be decoded before attempting to decode them. If they are already in UTF-8 format, then decoding is not necessary.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.
    
        :type request_headers: dict
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if value is bytes
                value = value.decode('utf8')  # Decode bytes to UTF-8
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue
    
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
