The code contains a few issues. The function is trying to decode the value using the `decode('utf8')` method, which may not be necessary if the value is already a string. It then tries to update `self['headers']`, but it seems to be missing the initialization of the `headers` property. Also, the loop for checking ignored header prefixes is not correctly implemented as it is not breaking when a match is found.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made:

1. Remove the unnecessary decoding of the value.
2. Initialize the `headers` property if it's not already defined.
3. Fix the loop for checking ignored header prefixes by using a flag that indicates if a match was found.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    if 'headers' not in self:
        self['headers'] = {}
    
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        ignore_header = False
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                ignore_header = True
                break
        if not ignore_header:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, `self['headers']` is initialized if it doesn't exist, and the loop for checking ignored header prefixes has been fixed.
