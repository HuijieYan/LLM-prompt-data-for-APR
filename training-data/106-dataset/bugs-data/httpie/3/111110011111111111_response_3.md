The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The method attempts to decode the value using the `decode('utf8')` method, assuming it's a byte string, but it doesn't handle the case when the value is `None`. This causes the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` when the value is `None`.

To fix the issue, you can modify the method to handle the case when the value is `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, a check for `None` can also be added to ensure that headers are not added if their values are `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf-8')

            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the revised method, a check for `None` is performed before attempting to decode `value`. Also, headers are only updated if their values are not `None`.
