Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `decode()` method is being called on a string, but `decode()` is a method that belongs to bytes objects, not strings. This is likely causing a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can remove the `value.decode('utf8')` line as it is unnecessary and causing the error.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/httpie_3/httpie/sessions.py

def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
