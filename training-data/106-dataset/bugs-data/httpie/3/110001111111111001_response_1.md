The error occurred in the `update_headers` function due to the `value` variable being `None`, which led to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

The reason for the error is that the `Accept-Encoding` header in the `request_headers` dictionary has a value of `None`, which cannot be decoded. This header value should be checked and handled appropriately.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it. We can also modify the loop that checks for ignored header prefixes to properly handle encoded header values.

Here is the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf-8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `value` is not `None`. If it's not `None`, we then check if it's an instance of bytes and decode it accordingly. Finally, we update the `self['headers']` with the processed value.
