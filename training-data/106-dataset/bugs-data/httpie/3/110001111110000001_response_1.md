1. The test case `test_download_in_session` is trying to execute a download request using the `http` function. This function ultimately calls the `update_headers` method from the `sessions.py` file to update the headers. The error occurs while trying to decode the value attribute of the `request_headers` dictionary, indicating that the `value` is `None`.

2. The potential error location within the `update_headers` method is the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `request_headers` contains a `None` value for one of the header names. When the loop encounters a header with a `None` value and tries to decode it, it results in an AttributeError because `None` does not have a `decode` attribute.

4. To fix the bug, we should first check if the value is not `None` before trying to decode it. Additionally, we should handle the potential `None` values appropriately within the function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `None` values before trying to decode the `value`. This will ensure that we don't get an AttributeError when a `None` value is encountered.
