The error "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" occurs because the value in the request_headers dictionary is None, which does not have the 'decode' attribute. This is likely due to the fact that the request_headers dictionary contains None values for some keys.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the value in the request_headers dictionary is not None before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the update_headers method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check `if value is not None:`, we ensure that only values that are not None will be decoded, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
