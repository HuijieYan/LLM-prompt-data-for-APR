The error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` is occurring because the `decode` method is being called on a value that is `None`. Looking at the code, the issue comes from the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` inside the `update_headers` function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before decoding it. Additionally, there is a missing attribute in the code. `SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES` is being used, but it is not defined in the given code.

Here is the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name.lower() == 'user-agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            # SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES should be defined somewhere
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

However, for the code to work properly, the variable `SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES` should be defined somewhere in the code. Without its definition, the `update_headers` function will not work as intended.
