The error occurs in the `update_headers` function. When handling the `Accept-Encoding` header, the code tries to decode a `None` value, which causes the AttributeError. This happens because the code does not check if the value is `None` before attempting to decode it.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the value is not None before decoding it. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this change, the code will first check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
