The error message "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" indicates that the 'value' variable is set to None at some point, and then the decode() method is being called on it, which is not possible since None does not have a decode() method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it iterates through the request_headers and sets the value to value.decode('utf8'). If the 'value' for any item in the request_headers is None, it will cause this error when trying to decode it.

To fix this bug, a check should be added to ensure that the 'value' is not None before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check 'if value is not None:', we ensure that the 'value' variable is not None before trying to decode it, thereby preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
