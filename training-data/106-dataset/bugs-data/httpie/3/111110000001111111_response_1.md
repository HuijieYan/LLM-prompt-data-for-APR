The error occurs due to the `decode` method being called on the `value` parameter in the `update_headers` function, which is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'`. This error is likely caused by the fact that the value of the 'Accept-Encoding' header in the request is None, which leads to the `decode` method being called on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we should check if the value is not None before trying to decode it. Additionally, we should also ensure that the 'User-Agent' header is checked for its value before trying to decode it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict
        """

        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if value is not None:
                value = value.decode('utf8')
                
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for NoneType before trying to decode the value. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
