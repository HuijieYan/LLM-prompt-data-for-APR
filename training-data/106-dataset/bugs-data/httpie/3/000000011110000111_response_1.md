The test case provided is attempting to send an HTTP request using the HTTPie library. The error occurs during the processing of the request headers. 

The `update_headers` function is attempting to decode the value of the request headers using the `decode('utf8')` method. This method causes an error when the value is `None`, which can happen if the header does not exist in the request.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the value is `None` before attempting to decode it. 

Here is the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. If it is `None`, we just skip the decoding and proceed with the other checks and updating the headers.
