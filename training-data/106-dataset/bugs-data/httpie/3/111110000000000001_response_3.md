Potential error location: The error is occurring in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` because the `value` variable might not always be a byte string that needs decoding.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `value` variable is being blindly decoded as a byte string without checking its type first. This can lead to a `UnicodeDecodeError` if `value` is already a string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of `value` before decoding it. If it's already a string, no decoding is needed.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the `UnicodeDecodeError` and handle it gracefully.

Corrected code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            try:
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            except UnicodeDecodeError:
                pass
                
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
