Potential error location: The error occurs in the `update_headers` function when trying to decode the `value` variable using the `decode` method. The error message indicates that the `value` variable is `NoneType`, meaning it does not have a value, and therefore cannot be decoded.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the code assumes that the `value` variable is always present and not `None`, which is not always the case. This assumption leads to the `decode` method being called on a `None` value, resulting in the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `value` variable is `None` before trying to decode it.
2. Handle the case where the `value` variable is `None` and provide a default value or skip the decoding process.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected update_headers function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
