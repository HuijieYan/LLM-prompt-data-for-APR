Potential Error Location:
The error occurs while trying to decode the value of the 'User-Agent' header. The issue lies in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`, where the value is not guaranteed to be a bytes-like object that can be decoded.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that the value of the 'User-Agent' header is always in bytes format. If the value is already a string, attempting to decode it will result in a TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the value before attempting to decode it to ensure it is a bytes-like object.
2. If the value is not a bytes object, handle it as a string without decoding.
3. Consider using the `str()` function to ensure the value is converted to a string if needed.

```python
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            value = str(value)
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the value is a bytes-like object before attempting to decode it. If it is a bytes-like object, we decode it using 'utf-8'. Then, we ensure that the value is converted to a string using the `str()` function. This approach handles both bytes and string values for the headers, avoiding the TypeError that was present in the original code.
