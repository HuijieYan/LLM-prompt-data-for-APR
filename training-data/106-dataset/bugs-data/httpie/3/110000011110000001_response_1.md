The error occurs when the `value` variable is being decoded as utf8 in the `update_headers` method. The error message indicates that the `value` is of type `None`, which means that it has not been set correctly.

The bug occurs because the `update_headers` method is attempting to decode the `value` without validating whether it's `None` or not. This is likely happening when the `request_headers` dictionary passed to the method contains a `None` value for a specific header.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check for `value` not being `None`, we prevent the AttributeError that was occurring in the original buggy function.
