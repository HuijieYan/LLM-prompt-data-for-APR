Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` because the `decode` method is being called on a value that is not a byte string.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is occurring because the value in the `request_headers` dictionary is not a byte string that needs to be decoded.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Check if the value is a byte string before decoding it. If it is not a byte string, then leave it as is.

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):  # check if value is a byte string
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
