The error is occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. Specifically, the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` is being triggered by the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

The reason for the error is that the `value` variable is sometimes `None`, which does not have a `decode` method.

To fix the bug, we can check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict

        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if value is not None:
                value = value.decode('utf8')
                if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                    continue

                for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                    if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                        break
                else:
                    self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
