The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode', which means that the value in the request_headers dictionary is None. This is likely causing the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we should add a condition to check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it.

Also, the function is trying to access self['headers'], but it seems like 'headers' is a property of the object and should be accessed with a dot notation as well.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self.headers[name] = value
```
