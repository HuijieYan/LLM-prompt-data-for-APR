The error "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" occurs because the value in the request headers is 'None' which means that the value is not present. This causes an error when trying to decode a non-existent value.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the value is not 'None' before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected version of the update_headers function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if the value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected version, we added the condition `if value is not None:` before trying to decode the value. This ensures that we only decode the value when it's not 'None', preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
