The test case `test_download_in_session` is not directly related to the error message, but it involves calling a function that uses the `update_headers` method, which is the function that contains the bug.

The error occurs in the `update_headers` function on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. The error message indicates that `value` is of type `None`, which cannot be decoded.

The bug originates from the fact that `Accept-Encoding` comes with a value of `None`, which is not expected. The `update_headers` function fails to handle such cases and attempts to decode a value that is not a byte string.

One approach to fixing this bug is to check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
