The error 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'' occurred because the code is trying to call the `decode()` method on a value that is None. This happens when the `'Accept-Encoding'` header is `None` because of the way the function is written. The current implementation does not handle the case where the header value is `None`.

To fix the bug, you can add a check to see if the header value is `None` before trying to decode it. If it is not `None`, then you can decode it using the `utf-8` encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """

    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this correction, the code will first check if the header value is `None` before trying to decode it. If it's None, it will simply assign the value as is. This change will resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
