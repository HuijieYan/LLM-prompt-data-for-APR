Potential error location: The line `value = value.decode('utf8')` is causing the error.

Reason behind the bug: The `decode` method is used to convert a string into a bytes object, but it seems that `value` is already a string, so the `decode` method is not necessary and is causing the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Since `value` is already a string, we can remove the `decode` method and directly assign `value` to itself.

Corrected code:

```python
    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.
    
        :type request_headers: dict
    
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue
    
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
