The issue is occurring within the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, which means that the `value` variable is `None`.

The bug is likely caused by the `request_headers` dictionary containing a value that is `None` for a specific header. This causes the subsequent `decode` call to fail since `None` does not have a `decode` method.

To fix this bug, you can add a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, you may want to consider other error handling or sanitization for the headers dictionary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the `if value is not None` check, we ensure that only valid values are decoded, preventing the `NoneType` attribute error.
