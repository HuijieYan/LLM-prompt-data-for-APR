Potential error location: The line causing the error is `value = value.decode('utf8')`. 

Reasons for the bug: The function is trying to call the `decode` method on the `value` variable assuming it is of type `bytes`, but in the provided input `Accept-Encoding` header is `None`, which leads to the `decode` method being called on a `NoneType` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it.
2. Since the `Accept-Encoding` header can be of type `None`, the function could be updated to handle this case gracefully without attempting to decode `None`.
3. The decoding operation could be moved to a separate function or a utility method where the value can be checked and decoded.

Corrected code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
