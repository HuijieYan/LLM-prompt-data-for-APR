The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" is caused by the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` in the `update_headers` function. This means that the `value` is `None` in the input `request_headers` dict, and `None` does not have a `decode` attribute.

To fix this issue, we should check if `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. Additionally, the code should handle the case when `value` is not a byte string, as it is expecting a byte string due to the `decode` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None and isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `value` is not `None` and is a byte string before attempting to decode it. If these conditions are met, then we decode `value` using `utf8`. Finally, we proceed to update the session headers with the decoded value. This should fix the `AttributeError` caused by the `NoneType` object.
