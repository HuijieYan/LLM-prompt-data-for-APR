Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `update_headers` function on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. It seems that the `decode` method is being called on the `value`, which is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is caused by attempting to decode the value using `utf8` without checking if the value is actually a bytes object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by first checking if the value is a bytes object and then decoding it if necessary. Additionally, we need to modify the way headers are updated in the loop to avoid the issue.

Corrected code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if the value is bytes
            value = value.decode('utf8')  # Decode the bytes to utf-8

        if name.lower() == 'user-agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):  # Use lowercase comparison for name
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
