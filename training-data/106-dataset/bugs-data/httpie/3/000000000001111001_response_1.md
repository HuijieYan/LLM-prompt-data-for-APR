The bug in the function is that it is trying to access the 'headers' attribute of the object 'self', but 'self' is a Session object, not a dictionary. Instead, the headers should be accessed using the 'self.headers' syntax.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to access the 'headers' attribute as if it were a direct attribute of the 'self' object, but it is actually a nested attribute of the 'headers' attribute within 'self'.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to change the line `self['headers'][name] = value` to `self.headers[name] = value`.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self.headers[name] = value
```
