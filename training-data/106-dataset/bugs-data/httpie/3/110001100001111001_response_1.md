The error occurs because the function is trying to decode the request header values as utf-8, but in the case where the value is None (as in the 'Accept-Encoding' header), it cannot be decoded. This causes a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to only decode the value if it is not None. Additionally, we need to fix the way headers are updated in the session dictionary.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')

        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it. Then, we update the session headers using the correct method (self['headers'][name] = value).
