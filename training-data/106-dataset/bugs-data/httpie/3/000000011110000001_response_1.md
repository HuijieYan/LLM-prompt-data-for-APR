1. The test case is attempting to use the `update_headers` method of the session class, passing in the `kwargs['headers']` argument. The error message suggests that the `value` being operated on within the `update_headers` method is `None`, causing an AttributeError when attempting to call the `decode` method on it.

2. The potential error location within the `update_headers` method is the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. This is where the AttributeError is being raised.

3. The bug occurs because the code assumes that the `value` in the `request_headers` dictionary will always have a value and that it will be of type bytes that can be decoded using the `decode` method. However, it's possible for a header value to be `None`, which would cause this issue.

4. To fix the bug, a check can be added to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, it might be useful to log or handle the case where the `value` is `None` in a way that makes sense for the application.

5. Corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check `if value is not None`, we ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, we've added a check to ensure that the `value` is an instance of `bytes` before attempting to decode it, as the `decode` method is specific to byte strings. If the value is not `None` and is of type `bytes`, we decode it using the `decode` method.
