The error occurs when the `value` being processed has a `None` type, causing the AttributeError during the `decode('utf8')` operation. This is evident from the stack trace, which indicates that the line causing the error is within the `update_headers` method.

To resolve this issue, there should be a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, there should be a check for the type of `value` to avoid potential errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None and isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf8')

        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
This corrected function includes checks to ensure that `value` is not `None` and is of type `bytes` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, it retains the logic to ignore certain header prefixes and update the session headers accordingly.
