Given the error message and the provided code, it seems like the error is occurring when trying to decode the value of the request header, specifically the "Accept-Encoding" header, which has a value of `None`.

The bug is occurring because the code attempts to decode a `None` value, which is not allowed. Instead, we should only decode the value if it is a byte string.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `update_headers` function to check if the value is a byte string before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf-8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the `if isinstance(value, bytes)` check before attempting to decode the value, we ensure that only byte strings are decoded, and the bug should be fixed.
