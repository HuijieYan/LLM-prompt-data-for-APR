Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `Sessions` class where the `decode` method is being called on a value that is `None`.

Reason behind the bug: The error message indicates that the value being decoded is `None`, which means that the `request_headers` dictionary contains a key with a `None` value. This is causing a `NoneType` error when trying to call the `decode` method on it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It is important to check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle the case of a missing value.

Corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if the value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring in the future.
