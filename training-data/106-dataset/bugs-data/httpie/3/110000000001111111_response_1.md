The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'' indicates that the 'value' variable is of type 'None' and does not have the 'decode' attribute. This is likely due to the presence of the 'Accept-Encoding' header with a value of None in the request headers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line 'value = value.decode('utf8')'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the 'Accept-Encoding' header has a value of None, resulting in the 'value' variable being assigned a value of None. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to decode a NoneType object.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the 'value' variable is None and update the headers accordingly. We can use an if statement to check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
