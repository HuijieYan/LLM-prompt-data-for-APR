The error in the provided code is that it assumes all values in the `request_headers` dictionary can be decoded from 'utf8'. However, the `Accept-Encoding` header has a value of `None` which cannot be decoded, leading to the AttributeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it. Additionally, we can directly update the `self['headers']` dictionary with the `request_headers` dictionary, and there's no need to loop through and decode each value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `value` is not None before processing it. Then, we directly update the `self['headers']` dictionary with the `request_headers` dictionary. This avoids the need to decode the values and eliminates the AttributeError.
