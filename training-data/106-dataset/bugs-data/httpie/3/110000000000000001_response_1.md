The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to decode the `value` directly with the `decode('utf8')` method, which is causing an error because `value` might not always be a byte string that can be decoded.

The reason for the bug is that the function assumes that the `value` can always be decoded from 'utf8', which might not be the case.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the value is a byte string before decoding it. If it is not a byte string, then it should not be decoded.

```python
# Corrected function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
