The error is likely occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `value` variable is `None` at some point during the function execution.

The `value` variable is being assigned from the `request_headers` dictionary, and the error occurs when attempting to decode the value using the `decode` method. It seems that the `decode` method is not necessary in this context, and it's causing issues when `value` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be removed and a check for `None` values should be added before attempting to operate on the `value` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, the `decode` method has been removed, and a check for `None` values has been added before attempting to operate on the `value` variable. This should prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
