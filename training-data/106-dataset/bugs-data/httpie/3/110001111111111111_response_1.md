The bug occurs in the `update_headers` method in the `sessions.py` file of the `httpie` project. The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, meaning that the value passed to the `decode` method is `None`.

Looking at the buggy function given, the issue is with the `value` variable. The line `value = value.decode('utf8')` assumes that `value` is always a byte string that needs to be decoded. However, in the given test case, the `Accept-Encoding` header value is `None`, which causes the error.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where the `value` is `None` before attempting to decode it. One way to do this is by checking if the `value` is not `None` before decoding it.

Here's the corrected function `update_headers`:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if the value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check `if value is not None` before decoding it, we ensure that the `decode` method is only called when the `value` is not `None`, avoiding the AttributeError.
