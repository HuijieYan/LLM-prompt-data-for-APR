Potential error location: The problematic line is 'value = value.decode('utf8')' which tries to decode the value using 'utf8'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'' occurs because the 'value' variable is sometimes None, and the code is trying to decode it using 'utf8', which is not applicable for None type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the value is None before trying to decode it.
2. Skip decoding if the value is None.
3. Handle the None value in a way that maintains the functionality of the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
