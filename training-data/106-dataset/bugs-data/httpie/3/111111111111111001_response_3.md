The error occurs because the `decode` method is being called on a value that is `None` in the `request_headers` dictionary. This error is caused by the 'Accept-Encoding' header in the request_headers dictionary having a value of `None`.

To fix the bug:
- Check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it.
- If the value is not `None`, then perform the decode operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """

    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this fix, the `decode` method is only called on the `value` if it is not `None`, which should prevent the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode' error.
