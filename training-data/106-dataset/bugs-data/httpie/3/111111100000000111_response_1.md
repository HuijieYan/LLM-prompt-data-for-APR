The error is occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError with the 'NoneType' object having no 'decode' attribute, which suggests that the `value` being passed to the `decode` method is None.

The potential error location is the line: `value = value.decode('utf8')`. This line assumes that the `value` is always a valid string and tries to decode it using utf-8. However, if `value` is None or any other non-string type, it will result in the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `value` is not None and is of type string before trying to decode it. If the value is not None and is a string, then we can proceed to decode it using utf-8.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, str) and name.lower() not in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `value` is of type string using `isinstance(value, str)` and then ensure that the `name` is not in `SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES` before updating the session headers. This avoids the AttributeError and ensures that only valid string values are decoded.
