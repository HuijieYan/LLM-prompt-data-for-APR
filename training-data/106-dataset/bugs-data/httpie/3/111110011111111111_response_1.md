The error is occurring at the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, which means that `value` is `None`.

This likely occurs because the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `None` in the `request_headers` dictionary. When this header is encountered in the loop, it causes the `value` variable to be `None` instead of a byte string that can be decoded.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the `value` is `None` before trying to decode it. If it's not `None`, then we can proceed with the decoding process. If it is `None`, we can skip the decoding step.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this correction, the `None` value for `Accept-Encoding` header will be skipped, preventing the `NoneType object has no attribute 'decode'` error.
