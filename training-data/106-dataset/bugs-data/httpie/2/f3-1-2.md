Added argument to argparse, changed client so that it uses a new
requests Session() with the number of redirects and a single test to
show the setting works.

This happens in HTTPie, but running the exact same thing in curl works perfectly fine. Haven't been able to quite figure out what's going on.

I've expected http --follow to act in similar fashion as curl -i -L, however difference is that curl does show headers of all intermediate steps, httpie does not.

Expected result (standard post-redirect-get form):

Right now, we rely on the default max redirects set forth by Requests, which is currently 30. I think we should have an option to tinker around with this. It should be extremely easy to implement. It'd be a matter of adding about ten lines to httpie/cli.py, adding one to three and changing one or two in httpie/client.py.

Current Behavior:

$ http --follow http://httpbin.org/redirect/31

http: error: TooManyRedirects: Exceeded 30 redirects.
Proposed Behavior:

$ http --follow --max-redirects=31 http://httpbin.org/redirect/31
