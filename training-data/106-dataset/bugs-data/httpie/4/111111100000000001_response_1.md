It seems that there are multiple functions named "headers" with the same signature in the provided source code. It also looks like the intention is to define a property named "headers" within the class HTTPRequest.

The bug in the code is that the property "headers" is being defined multiple times with the same name but different implementations. This is not possible in Python and will result in a syntax error.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the duplicate definitions of the "headers" property and provide a single implementation for the "headers" property.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed property
    @property
    def headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```
