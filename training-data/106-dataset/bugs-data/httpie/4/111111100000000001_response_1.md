The potential error location within the problematic function is likely with the use of the `@property` decorator. This decorator is used to define a method that will be called when the property is accessed, but in this case, the function with the same name `headers` already exists in the class, leading to a conflicting method signature.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@property` decorator is trying to create a property with the same name as an existing method.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to rename the `@property` function to a different name, so it does not conflict with the existing method. Another approach is to simply remove the `@property` decorator if it is not needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# ... omitted code ...

class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def headers(self):
        # ... existing code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```
