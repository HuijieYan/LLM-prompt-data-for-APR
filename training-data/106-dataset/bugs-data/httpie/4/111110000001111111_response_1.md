The bug in the code is that the `Host` header is getting duplicated when a custom `Host` is specified. This is because the code checks if `Host` is in the headers and if not, adds it. However, it doesn't check for the casing of `Host`, leading to duplicate `Host` headers if different casings are used.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if `Host` is in the headers with case-insensitive comparison. If it is not in the headers, we can add it with the correct casing.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    host_header_exists = any(key.lower() == 'host' for key in headers)

    if not host_header_exists:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

With this corrected code, the `Host` header will be added with the correct casing if it's not already present in the headers, avoiding the duplication issue.
