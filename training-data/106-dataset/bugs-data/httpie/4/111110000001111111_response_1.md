The bug in the given function is caused by the fact that it defines a method named `headers`, and later defines a property with the same name. This overrides the method with a property, causing unexpected behavior.

The function is designed to construct and return a set of HTTP headers based on the input parameters. In the buggy case, the `Host` header is being added to the headers dict, but the casing of the host header is not consistent. This results in a duplicate `Host` header being added, one with proper casing and one without it.

To fix this issue, the function should be rewritten so that the `headers` method and property have distinct names. Additionally, the code for adding the `Host` header should ensure that it is consistent and does not duplicate.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_request_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )

        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc

        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]

        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')

        return headers
```

By renaming the method to `get_request_headers` and ensuring the correct casing for the `Host` header, we have addressed the bug. This revised function will construct the proper set of HTTP headers without duplication.
