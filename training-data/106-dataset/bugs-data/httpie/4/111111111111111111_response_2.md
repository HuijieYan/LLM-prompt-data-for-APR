The error in the function is that it is incorrectly creating duplicate Host headers when a custom Host is specified. The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the situation where a custom Host header is provided.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly checking if the 'Host' header is already present in the headers. If it is not present, it should add the custom Host header provided. However, currently it adds the custom Host header without checking, resulting in duplicate 'Host' headers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to first check if 'Host' header is already present in the headers. If it is not present, then add the custom Host header. If it is present, then replace it with the custom Host header.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    custom_host = url.netloc
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = custom_host
    else:
        headers['Host'] = custom_host

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
``` 

This updated code ensures that if the 'Host' header is not present, it adds the custom Host, and if it is present, it replaces it with the custom Host. This should resolve the issue of duplicate 'Host' headers when a custom Host is specified.
