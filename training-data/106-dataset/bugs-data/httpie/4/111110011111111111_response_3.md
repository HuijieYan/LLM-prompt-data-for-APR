The bug occurs because the function `headers` is intended to return a string, but it's defined as a property, which means it's being treated as an attribute. This causes unexpected behavior when trying to set the 'Host' header, as it's being duplicated in the returned string.

To fix the bug, the property `headers` should be renamed to something else, like `get_headers`, and the function should be defined with the `@headers.getter` decorator to ensure it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    @property
    def get_headers(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @get_headers.getter
    def get_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```

With this correction, the function will behave as expected when retrieving the headers, and the test case should pass without any errors.
