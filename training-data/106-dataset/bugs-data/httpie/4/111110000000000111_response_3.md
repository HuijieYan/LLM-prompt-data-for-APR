The bug in the provided function is that it is declared as both a method and a property with the same name "headers". This causes a conflict and could lead to unexpected behavior.

The error message specifies that when overriding the HTTP Host header, duplicate headers are being created if the casing of the command line option isn't correct. This points to a problem with the handling of the Host header in the headers function, which could be related to the bug in the function.

The bug occurs because the function is declared as a method and a property with the same name "headers". This causes ambiguity and can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access or modify the headers.

To fix the bug, the function/method should be defined with a different name to avoid the conflict. Additionally, the logic for handling the Host header should be reviewed to ensure that it is not creating duplicate headers when the Host is overridden.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of the fixed function in this class
    def get_request_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```
