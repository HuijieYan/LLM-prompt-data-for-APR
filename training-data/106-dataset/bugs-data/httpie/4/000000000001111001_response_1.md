The error in the given function is due to the use of property decorator without a corresponding setter method. The property decorator is used to define getters and setters for a particular attribute, but in this case, there is no setter method defined.

The error may also be related to the conversion of the headers variable to a string using the join and strip methods. It seems that the logic for preparing the headers is incorrect because it is converting the headers to a string before adding the 'Host' attribute. This could result in the 'Host' attribute being added to the wrong place in the headers.

To fix the bug, the property decorator should be removed and the method should be defined with 'self' as a parameter. Additionally, the logic for preparing the headers should be reviewed to ensure that the 'Host' attribute is added in the correct place.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = headers + ['Host: ' + url.netloc]

    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers)

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
