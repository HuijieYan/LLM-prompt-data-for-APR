The potential error in the problematic function is that it is both a method and a property with the same name "headers". This causes a conflict and will lead to unexpected behavior when trying to call the method.

The reason behind the bug is that the function "headers" is defined both as a method and as a property within the class "HTTPRequest". This causes a conflict as the same name is being used for both a method and a property within the class.

To fix the bug, we can rename the method "headers" to something else, and keep the property with the same name. This will resolve the conflict and prevent any unexpected behavior when calling the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of the corrected function in this class
    def get_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```
