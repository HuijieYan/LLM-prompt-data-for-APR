The error message in the test function indicates that there is an unexpected count of the 'Host:' header. This suggests that the 'Host' header is not being handled correctly, leading to an erroneous count in the test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'headers' property, where the 'Host' header is being modified or appended.

The bug occurs because the 'headers' property does not correctly handle the 'Host' header. It checks if 'Host' is present in the headers, but it uses a case-sensitive check which may not match all variations of the header's name, leading to incorrect handling.

To fix the bug, a case-insensitive check for the 'Host' header should be implemented, and the header should be modified or added according to the correct URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Case-insensitive check for 'Host' header
    host_header_present = False
    for name in headers.keys():
        if name.lower() == 'host':
            host_header_present = True
            break

    if not host_header_present:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In this corrected code, the 'Host' header is handled by performing a case-insensitive check for its presence in the headers. If it is not present, the 'Host' header is added or modified accordingly. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect count of the 'Host' header in the test and ensure proper handling of the headers.
