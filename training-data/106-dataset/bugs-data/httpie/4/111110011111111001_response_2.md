The HTTPRequest class contains a buggy function called headers. From the test_Host_header_overwrite test function and the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the count of the 'Host:' header being different than expected, and that's why the assertion is failing.

The problem lies in the headers function of the HTTPRequest class. The function is defined with the @property decorator, making it a property instead of a regular method. This is causing a conflict in the expected behavior of the function.

To fix this issue, the function should be renamed to something other than "headers" to avoid the conflict. Additionally, it should be defined as a regular method and not a property.

Here is the corrected code for the headers function:

```python
def get_headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In this corrected version, the function is renamed to get_headers and is defined as a regular method instead of a property. This should fix the conflict and make the test case work as expected.
