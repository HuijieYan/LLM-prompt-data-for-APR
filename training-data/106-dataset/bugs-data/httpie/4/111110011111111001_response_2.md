The bug in the provided code is that a property `headers` is defined twice in the class `HTTPRequest`. It is first defined as a normal method and then defined as a property using the `@property` decorator. This will cause the property definition to override the method definition, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should remove the method definition of `headers` and keep only the property definition.

Potential fix for the bug:
```python
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Remove the method definition of headers
    # def headers(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    # pass

    # This is the correct property definition
    @property
    def headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```

The bug was causing unexpected behavior in the `test_Host_header_overwrite()` test, where the count of 'Host:' header was found to be 2 instead of 1, leading to the test failure. With the function fixed, the `headers` will be correctly populated with the host information, and the test case should pass as expected.
