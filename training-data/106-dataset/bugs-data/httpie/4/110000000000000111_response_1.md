The bug seems to be related to the addition of the 'Host' header when it's not already present. It looks like the current code is adding the 'Host' header without checking if it already exists, leading to duplicate 'Host' headers.

The problematic part of the function is the section where it checks if 'Host' is not in the headers and then adds it. However, it doesn't check if 'Host' is already in the headers before adding it, leading to the possibility of duplicate headers.

The reason behind this bug is that the code doesn't account for the presence of the 'Host' header before adding it, hence causing duplicate headers.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the 'Host' header already exists in the headers dictionary before adding it. If it does, we should not add it again.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items() if name != 'Host']  # remove existing 'Host' header if present
    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    if 'Host' in headers:
        headers_list.insert(1, 'Host: ' + headers['Host'])  # add 'Host' header if not already present
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In the corrected code, we first remove any existing 'Host' header from the headers list, and then add it again if it's not already present. This ensures that we don't end up with duplicate 'Host' headers.
