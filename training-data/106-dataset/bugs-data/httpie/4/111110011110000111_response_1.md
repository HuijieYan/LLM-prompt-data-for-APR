Potential Error Location:
The problematic function in the HTTPRequest class is the headers method, which is meant to return the formatted HTTP request headers.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the headers method is defined as a property with the same name, causing the method to be overridden. This results in unexpected behavior and the generation of duplicate Host headers.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the method headers should be renamed to a different name to avoid conflicts with the property of the same name. Additionally, the code should be updated to ensure that the Host header is handled correctly when custom Host is specified.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function with a different name
    def get_request_headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```
The method has been renamed to get_request_headers to avoid conflicts with the property of the same name. This should fix the bug and prevent the generation of duplicate Host headers.
