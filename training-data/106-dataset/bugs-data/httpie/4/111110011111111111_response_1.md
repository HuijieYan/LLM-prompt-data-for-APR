The bug in the provided code is due to the presence of both a method and a property with the same name `headers`. This causes the property to override the method, leading to unexpected behavior.

The error message from the test function indicates that the number of occurrences of the 'Host:' header in the response is not as expected. This suggests that the 'Host' header is being duplicated, which aligns with the code issue of setting the 'Host' header twice within the buggy function.

To fix the bug, the property `headers` should be renamed to something else to avoid conflicts with the existing method.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPRequest(HTTPMessage):
    """
    A :class:`requests.models.Request` wrapper.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # fixed function
    def get_headers(self):  # renaming the property to avoid conflict
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )
    
        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]
    
        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
```

By renaming the property to `get_headers`, it no longer conflicts with the existing `headers` method, resolving the issue of the 'Host' header being duplicated. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected variable value and type.
