The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of the headers in the `headers` property. The bug is related to the process of adding the 'Host' header to the existing headers.

The issue appears to be with the line:
```python
if 'Host' not in headers:
```
This condition is checking if the 'Host' key is not present in the `headers` dictionary, but this check may be incorrect due to the way Python handles the keys with case sensitivity. It's possible that 'Host' may already exist in the `headers` dictionary, but with a different case (e.g., 'host'). This could lead to a new 'Host' header being added when it's actually not required.

To fix this buggy function, it is advisable to first check all the existing keys in the `headers` dictionary and ensure that the 'Host' header is added or updated to have the correct value. A case-insensitive comparison should be used to check for the existence of the 'Host' header in the `headers` dictionary.

Additionally, based on the tests, there's a need to ensure that the 'Host' header is in the correct format, and the value should be obtained from the `url` rather than the hardcoded value.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    # Use a case-insensitive comparison to check for existing 'Host' header
    headers = {name.lower(): value for name, value in self._orig.headers}
    
    # Add/update the 'Host' header with the value from the url
    headers['host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    
    return headers
```
With these corrections, the `headers` property should function correctly and resolve the test failure.
