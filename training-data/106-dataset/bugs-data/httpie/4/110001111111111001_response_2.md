The bug seems to be related to the "Host" header being overwritten. The error message from the test function indicates that the "host:" count is considered to be 2 instead of 1.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic responsible for adding the "Host" header, which involves checking if "Host" is not in the headers and then adding it with the value of "url.netloc.split('@')[-1]".

The bug occurs because the condition checking if 'Host' is not in headers is case-sensitive. When 'Host' and 'host' headers are present, one of them is overwritten, causing the issue in the test function.

To fix the bug, the condition should be made case-insensitive, and the correct "Host" header should be added if it's not present in the headers.

Here's the corrected code for the headers function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in (name.lower() for name in headers):
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
