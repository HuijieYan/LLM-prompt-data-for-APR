The error message from the test function suggests that the test is expecting the count of 'Host:' in the response to be 1, but it's actually 2. This indicates that the 'Host' header is being duplicated, which is likely due to the buggy function.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional check for the 'Host' header. If 'Host' is not in the headers dictionary, it adds it to the headers, but it doesn't check for case-insensitivity. This could lead to a duplicate 'Host' header being added when the custom host is specified with different casing.

The bug occurs because the function does not check for case-insensitivity when adding the 'Host' header, leading to potential duplication of the header.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the existence of 'Host' header in a case-insensitive manner before adding it to the headers. Additionally, it should handle the custom host provided in the HTTP request.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Check for case-insensitive existence of 'Host' header
    if not any(key.lower() == 'host' for key in headers.keys()):
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    # Handle the custom host provided in the HTTP request
    if self._custom_host:
        headers['Host'] = self._custom_host

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for case-insensitive existence of the 'Host' header and handled the custom host provided in the HTTP request to ensure that the 'Host' header is not duplicated.
