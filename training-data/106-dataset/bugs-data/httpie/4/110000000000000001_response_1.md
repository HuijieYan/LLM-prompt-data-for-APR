The potential error in the provided code is that it uses the `@property` decorator, which implies that it is meant to be a method of a class, but it does not contain the `self` parameter as the first parameter, indicating that it is not properly defined as a method.

The reason for the bug is that when using the `@property` decorator, the method should have a `self` parameter as the first parameter in order to access the attributes of the class. Without the `self` parameter, the method will not be able to access the attributes of the class, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, the method should be properly defined as a method of a class by including the `self` parameter as the first parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class ClassName:
    @property
    def headers(self):
        url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

        request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
            method=self._orig.method,
            path=url.path or '/',
            query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
        )

        headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

        if 'Host' not in headers:
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

        headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]

        headers.insert(0, request_line)
        headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

        if isinstance(headers, bytes):
            # Python < 3
            headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        return headers
``` 

In the corrected code, the `self` parameter has been added to the `headers` method, making it a valid method of a class.
