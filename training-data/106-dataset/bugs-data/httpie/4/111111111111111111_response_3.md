The error occurs in the `headers` property of the `HTTPRequest` class. The bug is causing the `Host` header to be duplicated when a custom Host is specified, leading to assertion errors in the test case.

The bug happens because the code does not check for the presence of the `Host` header before adding it. As a result, if the `Host` header is not present, it adds a new one without removing the existing one, causing duplication.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `Host` header is already present in the headers. If it is present, we should update it with the custom host value. If it is not present, we should add it.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

This fix ensures that the `Host` header is either updated or added based on its presence in the original headers, resolving the duplication issue.
