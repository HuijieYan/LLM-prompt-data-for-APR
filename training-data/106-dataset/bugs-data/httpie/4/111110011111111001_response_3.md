The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of the 'Host' header in the 'headers' method of the HTTPRequest class. This method is supposed to return the headers of the request as a string, but it seems to be modifying the headers incorrectly.

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the presence of a 'Host' header, and if it's not present, it is adding a new 'Host' header using the 'netloc' value from the URL. However, the 'Host' header key should be case-insensitive according to the HTTP specification. Therefore, 'host' should be replaced with 'Host'.

To fix this bug, the 'if' condition that checks for the presence of the 'Host' header needs to be modified to use a case-insensitive check. Additionally, the 'Host' header should be added to the 'headers' dictionary using the correct case.

Here's the corrected code for the 'headers' method:

```python
# Corrected headers method
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Case-insensitive check for 'Host' header
    has_host_header = any(name.lower() == 'host' for name in headers)

    if not has_host_header:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

With these changes, the 'Host' header will be added to the 'headers' dictionary using the correct case, and the bug should be fixed. This should also resolve the error in the test case related to the 'Host' header overwriting.
