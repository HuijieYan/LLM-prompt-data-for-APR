The error occurs in the `headers` function of the `HTTPRequest` class. The specific problem is related to the `Host` header being inserted twice when it should be added only if it is not already included in the headers.

The reason behind the bug is that the function incorrectly inserts the `Host` header at the beginning of the headers list without first checking if it already exists.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `Host` header is already in the headers dictionary. If not, it should add the `Host` header using the `url.netloc` value. Then, it should iterate through the headers dictionary items and format them into a list of strings representing the header key-value pairs. Finally, it should join the list of headers with `\r\n` as the delimiter and return the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
