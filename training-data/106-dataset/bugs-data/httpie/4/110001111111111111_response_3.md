The bug occurs in the headers method of the HTTPRequest class. The bug causes duplicate Host headers to be included if the custom Host header is specified on the command line with different casing. The headers method is used to construct and return the headers for an HTTP request.

The bug occurs because the code does not check for the existence of a Host header before adding it. As a result, if the Host header is not present, a new one is added without replacing the existing one, leading to duplicate headers.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the Host header already exists in the headers dictionary, and if it does, replace it with the custom Host value. Then, the code should construct the headers list and join it into a string to return.

Here's the corrected code for the headers method:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
                   for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers_str = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers_str, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers_str = headers_str.decode('utf8')
    return headers_str
```

With this correction, the bug causing duplicate Host headers should be resolved. The fixed code checks for the existence of the Host header and replaces it if necessary, ensuring that only one Host header is included in the final HTTP request headers.
