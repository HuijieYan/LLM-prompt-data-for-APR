The error message in the test function 'test_Host_header_overwrite' indicates an assertion error related to the count of 'host:' in the response. The test is expecting a count of 1, but it actually receives a count of 2.

Upon analyzing the provided function 'headers', it seems that the buggy section is where the 'Host' header is being added to the headers dictionary. The issue arises from incorrectly setting the 'Host' header, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs because when the 'Host' header is not present in the headers dictionary, it is being added by splitting the 'netloc' attribute of the URL. This logic is flawed because if the URL contains an authenticating user information (such as "user:password@host"), the 'netloc' splitting will not properly get the intended host.

To fix the bug, we need to use the 'url.netloc' attribute directly to extract the host, and then set the 'Host' header in the headers dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the 'headers' function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

With this correction, the 'Host' header will be accurately extracted from the URL's 'netloc' attribute, which should resolve the assertion error in the test function.
