The bug is likely occurring at the line where the 'Host' header is being added to the headers dictionary. It seems that the bug is causing the 'Host' header to be added twice, resulting in duplicate Host headers in the HTTP request.

The reason for this bug could be that the code doesn't check if the 'Host' header already exists before adding it to the headers dictionary. This could be causing the 'Host' header to be duplicated if it's added multiple times.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the 'Host' header already exists in the headers dictionary before adding it. If it does, we can update its value. If it doesn't exist, we can add it as usual.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]  # Update the 'Host' header if it already exists

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
