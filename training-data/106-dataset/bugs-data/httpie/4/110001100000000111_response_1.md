The error seems to be occurring when overriding the HTTP Host header, resulting in duplicate headers if the casing of the command line option isn't correct.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the code block where the Host header is being added to the headers dictionary.

The bug occurs because the code does not check for case sensitivity when checking if the 'Host' key is already present in the headers dictionary. This results in duplicate Host headers being added if the casing of the custom Host specified is not correct.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check for the existence of the 'Host' key in a case-insensitive manner and replace it if it already exists. We can also ensure that the custom Host specified by the user is added with the correct casing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    host_header_exists = False
    for name in headers:
        if name.lower() == 'host':
            headers[name] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
            host_header_exists = True
            break

    if not host_header_exists:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
