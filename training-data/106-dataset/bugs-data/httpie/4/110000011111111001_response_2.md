The error message from the test function states that the assertion `assert r.lower().count('host:') == 1` has failed. This means that after making an HTTP request, the response `r` contains the substring 'host:' more than once. This implies that the 'Host' header is being duplicated or appended instead of being replaced, as intended in the buggy function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the 'Host' header is being modified.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function does not explicitly handle the 'Host' header replacement, resulting in the header being appended or duplicated. This leads to the failure of the test case.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the section of the code responsible for handling the 'Host' header to ensure that it is being replaced instead of appended or duplicated.
2. If 'Host' header replacement is not supported or applicable in the given context, appropriate documentation of the behavior should be provided and tests should be updated to reflect this.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]  # Replace 'Host' header

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
