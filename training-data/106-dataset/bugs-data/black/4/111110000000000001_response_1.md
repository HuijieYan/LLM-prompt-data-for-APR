Potential Error Location: 
The issue lies in the line `before -= self.previous_after`. It seems like `self.previous_after` is not initialized anywhere.

Reason for the Bug:
The variable `self.previous_after` is not initialized in the `maybe_empty_lines` function, which leads to an error when trying to subtract from it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to initialize `self.previous_after` before using it in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. We can do this by adding an initialization line in the `__init__` method of the class.

Corrected Code:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# class declaration containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
