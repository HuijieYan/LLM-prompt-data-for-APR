The error message from the test function indicates that the `assertEqual` method is comparing the expected and actual values and finding a mismatch. The specific mismatch is that the actual value has two extra newlines before the `print("hello, world")` statement compared to the expected value.

The potential error location within the `maybe_empty_lines` method is the calculation of the `before` value, which is subtracting `self.previous_after` from the result of `self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `before` value should include the extra empty lines before the `current_line` and then subtracting `self.previous_after` is causing the incorrect value to be returned.

To fix this bug, a correction in the calculation of the `before` value is required. Instead of subtracting `self.previous_after` from the `before` value, the correct approach would be to add `self.previous_after` to the `before` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Corrected calculation
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
