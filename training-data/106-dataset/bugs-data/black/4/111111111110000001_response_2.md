The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual output strings do not match. The expected output is 'print("hello, world")\n' and the actual output is '\n\nprint("hello, world")\n', which suggests that the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The potential error location within the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the lines:

```python
before -= self.previous_after
self.previous_after = after
```

The bug is occurring because `self.previous_after` is being subtracted from `before` before being updated with the new `after` value. This can lead to incorrect calculations for the number of extra empty lines before the current line.

To fix this bug, the value of `self.previous_after` should be updated before subtracting it from `before`. Additionally, it is important to initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` to appropriate values in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
The correct code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function is:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    extra_before = before - self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    return extra_before, after
```
