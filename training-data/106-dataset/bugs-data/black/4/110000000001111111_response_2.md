The bug seems to be located in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The expected behavior for this function is to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. However, in the Buggy case 1, it is returning `0` before and after, while the Expected case 1 expects `2` before and `0` after.

The issue arises from the fact that the `before` variable is being incorrectly updated before it is returned. The `before` variable is being adjusted after `self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)` is called, but it should be adjusted before the call to `self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)`.

To fix the bug, the `before` variable should be adjusted before calling `self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before = self.previous_after  # Adjust before calling self._maybe_empty_lines
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
