The issue seems to be related to the formatting produced by the Black formatter. The specific error message "Explicit line join in the first line" indicates that there might be an issue with the line breaks or explicit line joins in the source code.

Looking at the provided source code, it seems that the issue is indeed related to the line breaks and formatting within the `maybe_empty_lines` method. The error occurs when the code is being formatted by Black, and it seems to be related to the way the `before` and `after` values are being used.

The bug in the `maybe_empty_lines` method is likely caused by the way the `previous_after` and `previous_line` variables are being used. It seems that these variables are not initialized or updated properly, leading to unexpected behavior during the second pass of the formatter.

To fix this bug, the `previous_after` and `previous_line` variables should be initialized properly, and their values should be updated accordingly to ensure that they reflect the correct state of the `current_line` being processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:
```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    
    if not hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        self.previous_after = 0
    
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, I added a check to ensure that the `previous_after` attribute is initialized if it doesn't exist. This should help resolve the issue with unexpected behavior during the second pass of the formatter.
