The bug in the code seems to be in the assignment of 'before' variable. The 'before' value is being decremented by 'self.previous_after', but 'self.previous_after' remains unchanged throughout the function. This might cause an inaccurate result. 

To fix the bug, we should create an attribute `self.previous_after` and set it to the value of `after` after the computation.

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    calculated_before = before - self.previous_after  # change the variable name to avoid conflict with existing attribute
    self.previous_after = after  # assign the 'after' value to 'self.previous_after' for future iterations
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return calculated_before, after
```
