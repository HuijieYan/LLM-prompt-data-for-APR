The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the `previous_after` attribute. When the function `maybe_empty_lines` is called multiple times, the `before` value is being modified by subtracting `self.previous_after`. This suggests that `previous_after` is intended to store the value of `after` from the previous call, but it is not initialized before the first call.

The bug occurs because `self.previous_after` is not initialized before the first call to `maybe_empty_lines`, causing a potential unexpected behavior on the first call.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_after` is initialized to 0 before the first call to `maybe_empty_lines`. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        self.previous_after = 0
    
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

By adding the condition `if not hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):` before initializing `self.previous_after`, we ensure that it is only initialized on the first call to `maybe_empty_lines`, preventing unexpected behavior and fixing the bug.
