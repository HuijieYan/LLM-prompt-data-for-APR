The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` function is called in the `test_beginning_backslash` test case. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are different, with extra empty lines being added to the actual output.

The bug is caused by the `maybe_empty_lines` function not correctly subtracting `self.previous_after` from the `before` value before returning it. This leads to incorrect calculation and incorrect addition of extra empty lines.

To fix the bug, the `maybe_empty_lines` function should correctly subtract `self.previous_after` from the `before` value before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after  # Subtract the previous_after value
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With this correction, the `maybe_empty_lines` function now correctly subtracts `self.previous_after` from the `before` value before returning it, addressing the bug.
