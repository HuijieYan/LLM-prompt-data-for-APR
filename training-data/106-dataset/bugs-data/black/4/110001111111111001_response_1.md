The test case `test_beginning_backslash` is comparing the expected output with the actual output using `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)`. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not equal.

The potential error in the `maybe_empty_lines` method lies in the logic for calculating the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

The bug occurs because the logic to subtract `self.previous_after` from `before` is incorrect. This causes the `before` value to be smaller than the expected value, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the `before` value by subtracting `self.previous_after` should be modified to ensure that the correct number of empty lines before the `current_line` is calculated.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    extra_lines_before = before - self.previous_after
    
    # Adjust the 'before' value to ensure a non-negative number of empty lines
    before = max(0, extra_lines_before)
    
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
``` 

In the corrected code, the variable `extra_lines_before` is used to calculate the adjusted `before` value by subtracting `self.previous_after`. Then, the `before` value is constrained to be non-negative using `max(0, extra_lines_before)`. This ensures that the correct number of empty lines before the `current_line` is returned.
