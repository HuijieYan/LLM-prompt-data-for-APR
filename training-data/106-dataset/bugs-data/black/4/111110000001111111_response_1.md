The issue seems to be with the `maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is intended to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but the manipulation of the `before` and `after` variables seems to be incorrect.

From the error message, it looks like the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not producing the expected behavior in the second pass of the code formatter.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue arises from the line `before -= self.previous_after`. Here, `before` is modified based on the value of `self.previous_after`, which doesn't seem to align with the intended functionality.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the calculation for `before` and `after` based on the logic provided in the function's description.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)

    if self.previous_line is None:
        before = 2  # Set to 2 on module-level
    elif self.previous_line.leaves[0].type in (NAME, ASYNC, CLASS):
        before = 2  # Set to 2 after def, async def, or class
    else:
        before = max(before - self.previous_after, 1)  # Subtract previous_after, but keep at least 1

    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we check if `self.previous_line` is `None` or if the first leaf of the `self.previous_line` is a `def`, `async def`, or `class`. Based on these conditions, we update the value of `before` accordingly.

This should resolve the issue and improve the behavior of the `maybe_empty_lines` function.
