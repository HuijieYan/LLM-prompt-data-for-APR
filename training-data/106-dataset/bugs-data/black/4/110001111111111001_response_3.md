The buggy function `maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. It seems that the function is incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines and is returning an incorrect result.

The error message from the test function indicates that the call to `assertFormatEqual` fails because the expected and actual values do not match. The expected value is `'print("hello, world")\n'` while the actual value is `'\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the empty lines before the `print` statement.

The potential error location within the function is the calculation of the `before` variable. It subtracts `self.previous_after` from the result of `self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)`. This may be causing the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before the `current_line`.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `before` should be modified to add `self.previous_after` instead of subtracting it. This will correctly account for the previous empty lines and give the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Modify the calculation to add previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
