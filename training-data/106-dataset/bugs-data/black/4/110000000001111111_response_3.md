The bug in the provided function `maybe_empty_lines` is that the variable `before` is incorrectly being modified. It should be increased by 2 to account for the extra empty lines before the `current_line`, instead it is being decreased by `self.previous_after`.

This bug occurs because the function is incorrectly subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`.

To fix this bug, the function should add 2 to the `before` variable instead of subtracting `self.previous_after`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += 2  # Add 2 for the extra empty lines before current_line
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
