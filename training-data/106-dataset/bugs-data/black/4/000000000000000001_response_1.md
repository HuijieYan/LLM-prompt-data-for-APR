Potential error location: The variable `self.previous_after` is being used without being initialized within the function.

Reason for the bug: The variable `self.previous_after` is being used without being initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Initialize the `self.previous_after` variable to a default value, possibly 0, at the beginning of the class or within the `__init__` method.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        self.previous_after = 0

    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
