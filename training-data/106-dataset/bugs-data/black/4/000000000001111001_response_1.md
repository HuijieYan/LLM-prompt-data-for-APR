The issue appears to be with the calculation of the variable "before" within the function. The variable "before" is being decremented by the value of "self.previous_after" without considering the return value after calling the "_maybe_empty_lines" method.

To fix this issue, we should calculate the difference between the original "before" value and the return value from calling the "_maybe_empty_lines" method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return (before + self.previous_after), after
```
