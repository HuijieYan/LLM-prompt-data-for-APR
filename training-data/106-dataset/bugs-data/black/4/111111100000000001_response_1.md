Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the variable `self.previous_after`. It is being used without being initialized in the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The variable `self.previous_after` is being used in the `maybe_empty_lines` method without it being initialized. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Initialize the `self.previous_after` variable either in the `__init__` method of the class or at the class level.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.previous_after = 0
    self.previous_line = None

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
