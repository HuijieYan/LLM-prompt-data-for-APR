The bug in the code seems to be related to the `self.previous_after` variable. It is being used before it has been initialized. This causes the difference `before - self.previous_after` to be incorrect. 

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` before using it within the `maybe_empty_lines` function. This will ensure that the correct difference is calculated.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets, should_explode):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.should_explode = should_explode

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, is_pyi, previous_line, previous_after, previous_defs):
        self.is_pyi = is_pyi
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        self.previous_after = 0  # Initialize self.previous_after
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
