Based on the error message and the associated detailed issue description, it seems that the problem lies within the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The error message indicates that the expected and actual output are different, specifically relating to the presence of empty lines before and after the processed line.

It appears that the issue arises when computing the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The `maybe_empty_lines` method calls the `_maybe_empty_lines` method to compute these values, but then attempts to modify `before` using `self.previous_after` without initializing `previous_after` anywhere in the code. 

To fix this issue, the `previous_after` attribute needs to be initialized within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. 

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method along with the class definition:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class Line:
    pass

# corrected class definition
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0  # initialize previous_after attribute

    # corrected maybe_empty_lines method
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

By initializing the `previous_after` attribute within the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the `maybe_empty_lines` method should now operate as intended without causing the discrepancy in the number of empty lines.
