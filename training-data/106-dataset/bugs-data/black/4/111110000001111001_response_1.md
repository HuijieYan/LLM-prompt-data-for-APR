The problem in the provided code is that the `before` value is not being adjusted properly before returning. The adjustment is to subtract `self.previous_after` from the `before` value, but this is not being done correctly.

The bug occurs because the adjustment of subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before` should be retained even after the `before` value is modified.

To fix this bug, we should adjust the `before` value and then subtract `self.previous_after`. Additionally, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` in the `__init__` method of the class to ensure that it exists before any calculations are made.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    previous_before = before
    self.previous_after = after
    if self.previous_after and self.previous_line:
        self.previous_before = self.previous_line.depth
    before += self.previous_before - self.previous_after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
