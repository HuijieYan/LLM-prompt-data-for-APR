The bug occurred due to an issue in the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` in the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The bug has caused the test case to fail, indicating that the expected and actual output do not match.

The issue is in the section of code where the `before` and `after` values are adjusted using `self.previous_after` before being returned. The adjustment `before -= self.previous_after` should be changed to `before += self.previous_after` in order to correctly calculate the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line`.

Additionally, after the adjustments, the value of `self.previous_after` should be updated to the new `after` value.

The corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method is as follows:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Adjust the before value by adding previous_after
    self.previous_after = after  # Update previous_after to the new 'after' value
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With these changes, the bug should be fixed and the test case should pass successfully.
