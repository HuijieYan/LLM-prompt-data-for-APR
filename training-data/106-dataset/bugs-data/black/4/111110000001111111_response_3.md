The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the `before` value in the `maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Based on the provided information, the expected result for `before` is 2, but the actual result is 0.

The bug occurs because the logic for adjusting the `before` value is incorrect. It subtracts `self.previous_after` from the `before` value, but it should instead add `self.previous_after`.

To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the `before` value should be updated to add `self.previous_after` instead of subtracting it.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before += self.previous_after  # Update the logic to add self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
``` 

This corrected code should resolve the issue and produce the expected `before` value of 2 for the given input parameters.
