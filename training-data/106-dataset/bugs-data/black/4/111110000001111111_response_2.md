The bug in the `maybe_empty_lines` method lies in the line `before -= self.previous_after`. After this operation, the value of `before` is not being updated in the subsequent code. This is causing the incorrect final value for `before`.

The reason for the bug is that the value of `before` is being modified based on the `previous_after` attribute, but there is no subsequent code to update the value of `before` after this modification.

To fix this bug, the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method is provided below:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before = max(0, before - self.previous_after)  # Update 'before' considering 'previous_after'
    self.previous_after = after
    return before, after
```
