The error occurred in the test function "test_beginning_backslash" because the expected and actual outputs were not equal. The actual output had extra empty lines before the "print" statement, which was not expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` in the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

The bug occurred because the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` didn't take into account the scenario when the previous line was `None`, resulting in incorrect subtraction from the `before` variable.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` needs to be adjusted to handle the case when the previous line is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, is_pyi: bool, previous_line: Line, previous_after: int, previous_defs: list):
        self.is_pyi = is_pyi
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # implementation of _maybe_empty_lines method
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        if self.previous_line is None:
            before = 2
        else:
            before, _ = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
            before -= self.previous_after
        after = self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the `None` value of the previous line in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. If the previous line is `None`, we set the `before` variable to 2, indicating the extra empty lines at the module level. This handles the scenario when the previous line is `None` and ensures the correct calculation of extra empty lines.
