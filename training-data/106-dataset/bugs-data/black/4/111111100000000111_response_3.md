The bug seems to be related to the "maybe_empty_lines" function in the "EmptyLineTracker" class. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the code when it is run through the Black code formatter for the second time. The error appears to be related to some kind of boundary condition in the "EmptyLineTracker" class.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the "maybe_empty_lines" function is calling a private method "_maybe_empty_lines" to perform some calculations, but there might be an issue with the calculation or the manipulation of the "before" and "after" values.

One possible reason for the bug could be the inconsistent use of instance variables within the class, specifically "previous_after" and "previous_line". These variables seem to be used without initialization, and it's unclear if they are supposed to exist as instance variables of the class.

To fix the bug, we should initialize the "previous_after" and "previous_line" variables in the class constructor and update their values accordingly within the "maybe_empty_lines" function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Assuming the "Line" class is imported or defined elsewhere

# class declaration containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    # corrected method
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the corrected code, we have initialized the "previous_after" and "previous_line" variables in the constructor of the class "EmptyLineTracker". These variables are now being used within the "maybe_empty_lines" method without causing any issues. This should address the bug mentioned in the issue.
