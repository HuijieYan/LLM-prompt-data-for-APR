The bug in the given code is that the variable `before` should be incremented by 2, but currently, it's being decremented by `self.previous_after`. This is an issue because we want to add extra empty lines before the `current_line` for separation, not subtract from it.

To fix this bug, we should increment `before` by 2 instead of decrementing it by `self.previous_after`. Additionally, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` to 2 in the `__init__` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class to handle the case of module-level separation.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += 2  # Increment before by 2 for extra empty lines
    self.previous_after = 2  # Initialize previous_after to 2
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With these changes, the function should work as expected and return the correct number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` to separate `def`, `async def`, and `class` with extra empty lines.
