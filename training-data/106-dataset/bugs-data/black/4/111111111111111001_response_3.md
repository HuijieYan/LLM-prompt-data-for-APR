The bug seems to be in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The expected value for `before` is 2, but the actual value is 0.

The function `maybe_empty_lines` is subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`. This might be causing the issue as it's reducing the value of `before`. Instead, it should directly use `self._maybe_empty_lines` and update `self.previous_after` afterwards.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
