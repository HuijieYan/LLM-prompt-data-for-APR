The error message from the test function indicates an assertion error in the `assertFormatEqual` method. The expected and actual outputs are not matching, suggesting a potential bug in the `maybe_empty_lines` function, which is likely causing incorrect formatting.

Upon examining the `maybe_empty_lines` method, it seems that the error could be related to the calculation of the `before` and `after` variables. The `before` variable is being modified by subtracting `self.previous_after`, which might have unintended consequences on the calculation.

The reason for the bug could be related to incorrect modification of the `before` variable by subtracting `self.previous_after`. This modification might not be necessary and is likely causing the unexpected output.

To fix the bug, the modification of `before` by subtracting `self.previous_after` should be removed. This will ensure that the calculation of `before` and `after` is based solely on the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In this corrected code, the unnecessary modification of `before` by subtracting `self.previous_after` has been removed, and the function now correctly returns the calculated `before` and `after` values based on the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
