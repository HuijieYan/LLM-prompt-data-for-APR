The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line in the function `maybe_empty_lines`. The expected behavior is to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but it seems like the calculation is incorrect.

The `before` value is expected to be 2, but it is currently being calculated incorrectly in the buggy function. This is likely due to the incorrect subtraction of `self.previous_after` from the `before` value. 

To fix this bug, the subtraction of `self.previous_after` from `before` needs to be removed. Additionally, the `previous_after` attribute should be updated before the calculation of `before` and `after`. 

Here is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    self.previous_after = before  # Update previous_after before calculation
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly calculate and return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
