The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the `before` value. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but the logic used to calculate this value is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `before` value is wrongly decremented by `self.previous_after`. This logic is incorrect because it should not modify the value returned by `_maybe_empty_lines`. Instead, it should update the `previous_after` value to be used in the subsequent execution of the `maybe_empty_lines` method.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to correctly adjust the `previous_after` value without impacting the value returned by `_maybe_empty_lines`.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    # ...

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before += self.previous_after  # Correct the updating of 'before' value
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, the `before` value is updated correctly without being decremented by `self.previous_after`. This change ensures that the correct value is returned for the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line`.
