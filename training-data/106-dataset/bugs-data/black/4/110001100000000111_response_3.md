The error seems to be related to the `maybe_empty_lines` function in the `black.py` file. The function is attempting to calculate the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but it seems to be producing incorrect results.

The bug appears to be in the calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. Specifically, the line `before -= self.previous_after` seems to be incorrect, as it is subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before` without initializing `self.previous_after` anywhere in the code.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` before using it in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. We can do this by adding `self.previous_after = 0` before the line `before -= self.previous_after`.

Here is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        self.previous_after = 0  # Initialize self.previous_after
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```
