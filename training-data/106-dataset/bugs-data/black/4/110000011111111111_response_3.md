The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called in the `test_beginning_backslash` test case. The error message indicates that the expected output and the actual output are different. The actual output has two extra empty lines at the beginning. This suggests that the issue lies in the `maybe_empty_lines` function which is responsible for handling extra empty lines, but in this case, it's adding more empty lines than expected.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect adjustment of the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The function is expected to add two extra empty lines before the `current_line`, but it is not doing so.

To fix this bug, the function `maybe_empty_lines` should correctly adjust the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. It appears that the adjustment of the `before` variable is incorrect, which is leading to the extra empty lines.

Here is the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before = max(0, before - self.previous_after)  # Adjust the number of empty lines before
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment of the `before` variable ensures that the number of empty lines before the `current_line` is at least 0, and the correct number of empty lines will be added as required.

This change should address the issue and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is added before the `current_line`.
