The error message suggests that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual outputs are not matching. The expected output is 'print("hello, world")\n' while the actual output is '\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'. This indicates that the issue might be related to the function that is responsible for adding extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

Looking at the `maybe_empty_lines` function, it appears that the bug is in the line `before -= self.previous_after` because `previous_after` is not initialized anywhere in the code provided. This would lead to a potential `None` value for `self.previous_after`, resulting in the incorrect calculation of `before`.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` to 0 when the class is instantiated.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0  # Initialize previous_after here
        self.previous_line = None  # Initialize previous_line as needed

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

By initializing `self.previous_after` in the class's `__init__` method, we prevent it from being `None` and ensure that the calculation in the `maybe_empty_lines` function proceeds correctly.
