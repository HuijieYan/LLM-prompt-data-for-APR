The potential error in the `maybe_empty_lines` function is the use of `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` without initializing them in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This could cause the `before` value to be incorrect when subtracting `self.previous_after` from it.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` in the `__init__` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This will ensure that these variables are set to appropriate values before the `maybe_empty_lines` function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# corrected class declaration containing the fixed function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # initialize previous_after and previous_line in the __init__ method
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...

    # fixed function
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

With these changes, the `previous_after` and `previous_line` will be initialized properly and should not cause the error described in the test function.
