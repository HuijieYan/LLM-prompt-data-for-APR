The test case "test_beginning_backslash" is failing because the `assertFormatEqual` method is comparing the expected and actual strings and finding them different. The function "maybe_empty_lines" is expected to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The test case provides an example where an empty line is missing before the "print" statement.

The potential error location within the "maybe_empty_lines" function could be the logic used to determine the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line.

The bug is likely occurring because the "maybe_empty_lines" function is not considering the case where an additional empty line should be added before the "print" statement.

To fix the bug, the "maybe_empty_lines" function needs to be modified to consider the case where an additional empty line should be added before the current line. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic used to calculate the number of extra empty lines before the current line.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    if current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0] and current_line.leaves[0].value in {"def", "async def", "class"}:
        before += 1  # add an extra empty line before def, async def, or class
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
``` 

In this corrected function, an extra empty line is added before the "def", "async def", or "class" statements, which addresses the issue identified in the failing test case.
