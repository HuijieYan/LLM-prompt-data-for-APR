Potential Error Location: The statement `before -= self.previous_after` is likely causing the bug.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The variable `previous_after` is not defined in the given code, so attempting to subtract it from `before` will cause an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define and initialize the `previous_after` variable within the class.
2. Perform a check to ensure that `previous_after` has a valid value before subtracting it from `before`.
3. Initialize `previous_after` to 0 if no valid initial value is available.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected maybe_empty_lines function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    if hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        before -= self.previous_after
    else:
        self.previous_after = 0
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
