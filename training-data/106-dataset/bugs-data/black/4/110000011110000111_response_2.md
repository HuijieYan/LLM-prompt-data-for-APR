Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the formatting of the source code. It appears that the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, leading to a formatting issue when the source code is passed through the `fs` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly calculating the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, which is affecting the overall formatting of the code. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs, resulting in the assertion error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Review the logic inside the `maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the calculation of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line` is correct.
2. Check if the `self.previous_after` and `self.previous_line` attributes are being updated and used correctly within the function.
3. Debug the `maybe_empty_lines` function to identify any issues with the calculation of empty lines.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class SomeClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected code, the potential usage of the `maybe_empty_lines` function is incorporated into a class named `SomeClass`. The `maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to receive the `current_line` and returns a tuple containing the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The logic inside the function is reviewed and adjusted to ensure proper calculation of extra empty lines.
