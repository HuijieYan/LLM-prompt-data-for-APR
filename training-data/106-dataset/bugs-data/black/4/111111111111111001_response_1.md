The test case `test_beginning_backslash` involves comparing the expected and actual output of the `fs` function. The error message indicates that the number of empty lines before the statement has changed. This discrepancy likely occurs due to the incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before the `current_line` in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. 

The bug seems to be in the calculation of the `before` variable in the `maybe_empty_lines` method. The method does not correctly subtract the `self.previous_after` value from the calculated `before` value, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines.

To fix this bug, the subtraction of `self.previous_after` value from the `before` value needs to be performed before returning the `before` and `after` values. The corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method is as follows:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after  # subtract previous_after from before
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
