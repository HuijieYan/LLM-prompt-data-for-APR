The bug is likely in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected empty lines are not matching the actual empty lines in the output.

The issue is likely that the `before` variable in the `maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly adjusted to account for the `previous_after` value. It seems that the function is not properly tracking the number of empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `before` variable is adjusted correctly with the `previous_after` value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_after = 0
        self.previous_line = None

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        if self.previous_line is not None:
            before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to subtract the `previous_after` value from the `before` variable only if the `previous_line` is not None. This should address the bug and ensure that the function tracks the number of empty lines correctly.
