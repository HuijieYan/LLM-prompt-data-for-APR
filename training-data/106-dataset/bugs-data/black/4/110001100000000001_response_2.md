The potential error in the code is indentation. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is indented incorrectly, which leads to the `maybe_empty_lines` function calling a non-existent function.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the indentation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function so that it is properly defined inside the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

class ClassName:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we define the `_maybe_empty_lines` method properly within the class and fix the indentation. Now the `maybe_empty_lines` method can correctly call `_maybe_empty_lines`.
