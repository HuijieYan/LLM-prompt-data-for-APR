The bug in the provided function `maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the manipulation of the `before` and `after` variables. The code tries to adjust the `before` value by subtracting `self.previous_after` from it, but `self.previous_after` is never initialized in the code provided. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines.

The reason for the bug is that `self.previous_after` is not being initialized in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Without initialization, it is unclear what value `self.previous_after` should have, and this could lead to unexpected behavior in the `maybe_empty_lines` function.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `self.previous_after` to 0 in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, ensuring that it has a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after if hasattr(self, 'previous_after') else 0
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
