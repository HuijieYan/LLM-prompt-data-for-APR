The bug occurs in the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The `before` value is calculated incorrectly, which is leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, the correction in the code is to set the `before` value as the sum of `before` and `self.previous_after`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Updated line, adding the previous_after value to before
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
