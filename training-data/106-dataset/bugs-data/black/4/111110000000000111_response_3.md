The bug in the provided function maybe_empty_lines is that it's trying to subtract the value of self.previous_after from before without initializing self.previous_after. This will result in an AttributeError as self.previous_after doesn't have a value at the first invocation of maybe_empty_lines.

The reason for the bug is that the variable self.previous_after is being used without being initialized in the maybe_empty_lines function.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize self.previous_after before using it in the maybe_empty_lines function.

Here's the corrected code for the maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
    def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
        This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
        lines (two on module-level).
        """
        before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
        if hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
            before -= self.previous_after
        self.previous_after = after
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
```

In this corrected code, before subtracting self.previous_after from before, we first check if self.previous_after has been initialized using hasattr. If it has been initialized, then we proceed with the subtraction, otherwise, we skip it. This ensures that we don't encounter an AttributeError when using self.previous_after.
