Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the line "before -= self.previous_after". It appears that "self.previous_after" is being used before it has been initialized, causing the buggy behavior.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the variable "self.previous_after" is being used in the "maybe_empty_lines" function without being initialized. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to initialize the "self.previous_after" variable before using it in the "maybe_empty_lines" function. We can add a check to see if it has been initialized and initialize it if it hasn't been.

Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Assume Line is a custom class for lines
class Line:
    pass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
