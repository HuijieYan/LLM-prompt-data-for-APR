The error seems to be related to the `EmptyLineTracker` and the handling of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is likely responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines, and it seems that the calculation and adjustment of `before` and `after` are not functioning correctly, resulting in the bug.

The bug occurs because the adjustment of `before` is not correctly accounting for the `self.previous_after`. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_line` seems to be incorrect as well.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the calculation of `before` and `after` to correctly account for the `self.previous_after`, and also ensure that the `previous_line` is being tracked properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# this is the corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after  # Update previous_after after the calculation
    self.previous_line = current_line  # Update previous_line to the current_line
    return before, after
```
