The bug seems to be related to the behavior of Black, a code formatter for Python. The error message indicates that there is an explicit line join in the first line, and the diff between the first and second pass of the code shows a difference in the number of empty lines.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `before -= self.previous_after`. This line seems to be subtracting an incorrect value from the `before` variable, leading to unexpected results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `self.previous_after` variable is not initialized or updated properly, leading to a wrong value being subtracted from `before`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_after` is initialized properly and updated after each call to `maybe_empty_lines`. This will ensure that the correct value is subtracted from `before` and produce the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    
    if hasattr(self, 'previous_after'):
        before -= self.previous_after  # subtract previous_after only if it's already initialized
    else:
        before -= 0  # subtract 0 if previous_after is not initialized
    
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.previous_after` has been initialized using `hasattr`. Then, we subtract `self.previous_after` from `before` only if it has been initialized. If it hasn't been initialized, we subtract 0 instead to avoid any unintended consequences.
