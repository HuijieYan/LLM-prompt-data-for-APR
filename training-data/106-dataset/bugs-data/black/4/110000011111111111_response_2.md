The issue seems to be related to the calculation of empty lines before and after the `current_line`. The `maybe_empty_lines` method subtracts `self.previous_after` from the before value, but it does not update the `self.previous_after` value with the `after` value received from the `_maybe_empty_lines` method. This results in incorrect calculation of empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `self.previous_after` value with the `after` value received from the `_maybe_empty_lines` method before returning the values.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after  # Update previous_after with the new 'after' value
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
