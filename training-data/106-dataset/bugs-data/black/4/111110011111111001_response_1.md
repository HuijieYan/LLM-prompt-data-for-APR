The bug seems to be related to the `maybe_empty_lines` function, which calculates the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`. 

Based on the provided input and expected values:
- The proposed input involves a `current_line` with the content `print("hello, world")`, and the expected result is that `before` should be `2` and `after` should be `0`.
- The error message from the test indicates that the actual output of the function differs from the expected output.

Examination of the `maybe_empty_lines` function shows that the bug is related to the logic used to calculate the `before` variable. Specifically, the line `before -= self.previous_after` seems to be causing the issue. 

The reason for the bug is that the previous value of `previous_after` is subtracted from the calculated `before` value. This might be causing the `before` value to be lower than expected.

To fix the bug, it seems that the subtraction of `self.previous_after` from `before` should be removed. Additionally, the `previous_after` and `previous_line` attributes should be updated before returning the `before` and `after` values.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    # Remove the incorrect subtraction
    # before -= self.previous_after
    # Update the previous_after and previous_line attributes
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
