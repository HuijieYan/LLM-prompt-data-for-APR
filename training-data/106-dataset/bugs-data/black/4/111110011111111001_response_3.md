The error occurs in the `test_beginning_backslash` test case. The `assertFormatEqual` method is used to check whether the expected and actual outputs are equal. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'print("hello, world")\n'` while the actual output is `'\n\nprint("hello, world")\n'`. This suggests that the buggy function is not handling empty lines correctly.

The potential error location within the `maybe_empty_lines` method is the line `before -= self.previous_after`. This line subtracts `self.previous_after` from `before`, contributing to the discrepancy in the number of empty lines in the output.

The bug occurs because the `before` value is modified in the `maybe_empty_lines` method by subtracting `self.previous_after` without taking into account the potential extra empty lines needed. As a result, the discrepancy in the number of empty lines leads to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `before` value should be updated based on the number of extra empty lines needed, and the `after` value should be returned as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
    
    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before = max(0, before - self.previous_after)
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
```
