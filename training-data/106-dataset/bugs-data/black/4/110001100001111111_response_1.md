The issue seems to be occurring in the `maybe_empty_lines` method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The method is intended to return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`, but it is not doing so correctly.

Looking at the code and the input and expected output values, the issue can be identified. The method is subtracting `self.previous_after` from `before`, but it should be adding it to `before` instead. Additionally, it should set `self.previous_after` to the value of `after` before returning.

The reason for the bug is that the method is not handling the `previous_after` variable correctly. It is subtracting it from `before`, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the issue, we need to change the method implementation as follows:

```python
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before += self.previous_after  # Change subtraction to addition
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
``` 

With these changes, the method should now correctly calculate and return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.
