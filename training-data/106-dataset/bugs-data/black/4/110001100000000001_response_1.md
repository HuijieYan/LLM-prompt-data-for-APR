Potential error location: The bug is likely within the `maybe_empty_lines` method at the line `before -= self.previous_after`. It seems that `self.previous_after` is being used without being initialized.

Reasons behind the bug: The variable `self.previous_after` is not initialized anywhere in the method before being used in the line `before -= self.previous_after`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Initialize `self.previous_after` as 0 at the beginning of the `maybe_empty_lines` method to avoid the error.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_4/black.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Return the number of extra empty lines before and after the `current_line`.

    This is for separating `def`, `async def` and `class` with extra empty
    lines (two on module-level).
    """
    if not hasattr(self, "previous_after"):
        self.previous_after = 0
    before, after = self._maybe_empty_lines(current_line)
    before -= self.previous_after
    self.previous_after = after
    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, after
