The issue seems to be related to the handling of `target_versions` in the `get_grammars` function. The function is supposed to return a list of grammars based on the target versions provided. 

The issue is that when the target_versions set is not empty, the function checks if all versions are not Python 2, but it should actually check if any version is Python 2. This is evident from the test case input and expected output where the target version is set to `<TargetVersion.PY27: 2>`.

To fix this issue:
1. Change the condition from `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` to `any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`.
2. Update the function signature to include the `self` parameter if it's intended to be a method within a class.

```python
# corrected function
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(self, target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
