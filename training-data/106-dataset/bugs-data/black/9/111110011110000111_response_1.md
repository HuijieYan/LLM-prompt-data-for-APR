The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source text when using the `--target-version py27` option in the `black` module. The error occurs when trying to parse the `print(a, file=sys.stderr)` statement.

The potential error location is within the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. This condition is meant to check if all target versions are Python 2, but it may not be evaluating correctly.

The reason behind the bug could be that the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` is not evaluating as expected, causing the function to return the wrong set of grammars.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to refactor the condition in the `get_grammars` function to ensure that it accurately checks if all target versions are Python 2-compatible. Additionally, verifying the `is_python2()` method in the `TargetVersion` class to ensure that it correctly identifies Python 2 compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# Assuming Grammar and TargetVersion are imported from other modules

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

This corrected code eliminates the `is_python2()` method and directly compares the target versions with `TargetVersion.PY27` to check for Python 2 compatibility. This should resolve the issue with returning the correct set of grammars based on the target versions.
