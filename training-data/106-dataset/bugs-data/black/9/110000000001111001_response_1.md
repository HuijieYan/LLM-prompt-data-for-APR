The buggy function `get_grammars` has an issue with the condition `if not target_versions:`. This condition checks if the `target_versions` set is empty, but the intention seems to be different based on the subsequent logic.

The bug occurs because the code first checks if `target_versions` is empty, and if it is not, it checks if all the versions in `target_versions` are not Python 2. This does not cover the case where there are multiple versions in `target_versions` and some are Python 2 and others are not, which might lead to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we can first check if all the versions in `target_versions` are Python 2, and return the appropriate grammars. Then, if it's not the case, we can default to returning the Python 3 grammar.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import pygram  # assuming pygram module is imported from some_module

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if all(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # All versions in target_versions are Python 2
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code, we directly check if all versions in `target_versions` are Python 2, and return the appropriate grammars. If not, we default to the Python 3 grammar.
