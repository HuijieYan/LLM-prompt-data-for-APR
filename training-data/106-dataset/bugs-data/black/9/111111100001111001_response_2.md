The buggy function is trying to determine the grammars to be used based on the target Python versions provided. It seems to be trying to return Python 2-compatible grammars if all of the target versions are Python 2.

The potential error in the code is the use of `version.is_python2()` in the line `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):`. This line assumes that each `version` object in `target_versions` has an `is_python2()` method, which is not the case.

To fix the bug, we should change the way we check if all versions are Python 2. We can create a set of all versions and check if it contains `<TargetVersion.PY27: 2>`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import GRAMMARS, Grammar, TargetVersion, pygram

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif {<TargetVersion.PY27: 2>} in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
