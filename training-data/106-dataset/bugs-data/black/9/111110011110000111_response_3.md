The error seems to be related to the specific case when using target_version = py27. The error is raised when the `fs` function is called with this specific target version and it seems to be related to the parsing of the source code.

The potential error location is within the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the block that handles Python 2-compatible code.

The reason behind the bug is that when the target_version is set to py27, the function `get_grammars` returns a list of grammars, but it seems like it's not handling the provided grammar correctly, leading to the invalid input error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct grammar is returned for the given target version.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
# Assuming the import for Grammar and TargetVersion is properly defined

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]  # Assuming this is the correct grammar for Python 3
```

This updated code ensures that the correct grammar is returned based on the target version, which should resolve the bug when using target_version = py27.
