Potential error location: The error could be in the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`. The bug may occur here if the condition is not properly checking for Python 2 compatibility.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur because the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` is not correctly checking for Python 2 compatibility. It may not be correctly evaluating whether all target versions are Python 2 compatible.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the logic used to determine Python 2 compatibility and ensure it is accurately assessing the target versions.
2. Implement a more comprehensive check for Python 2 compatibility that covers all possible target versions.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
In the corrected code, the condition `any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` is used to correctly check for Python 2 compatibility. This approach ensures that if any of the target versions are Python 2 compatible, the corresponding grammars are returned.
