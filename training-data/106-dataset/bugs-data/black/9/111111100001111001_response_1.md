The error is likely occurring in the `get_grammars` function. It seems that the `is_python2` method is being called incorrectly. Also, the `Grammar` and `TargetVersion` types are not defined - they should be imported or defined at the top of the script.

The bug occurs because the `is_python2` method is being called incorrectly. It is being called as a standalone function instead of on an instance of a class. Additionally, the `Grammar` and `TargetVersion` types are used without being defined or imported.

To fix this bug, we can assume that `is_python2` is a method of the `TargetVersion` class and fix the function signature to reflect that. We also need to define or import the `Grammar` and `TargetVersion` types.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List


class TargetVersion:
    PY27 = 2


class Grammar:
    # Define Grammar class or import it from the appropriate module
    pass


def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    # Assuming is_python2 is a method of the TargetVersion class
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
