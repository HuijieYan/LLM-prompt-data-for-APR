Error:
The buggy function `get_grammars` is missing the `self` parameter, which suggests that it is a method of a class. Additionally, the `is_python2` method being called within the function is not defined properly. 

Reason for the Bug:
The `get_grammars` function is missing the `self` parameter, so it is not a method of a class. The `is_python2` method is being called as a method of the `self` object, but it is defined as a standalone function outside of the class.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the `get_grammars` function if it is intended to be a method of a class.
2. If `is_python2` is supposed to be a method of the same class, then define it within the class and access it using `self`.
3. If `is_python2` is not related to the class, then define it as a standalone function outside of the class.
4. If it is intended to be a standalone function, remove the `self` parameter from the function signature.

Corrected Code:
```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def is_python2(target_versions, value: Set[TargetVersion]) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...

class ClassName:  # assuming this class is supposed to contain the get_grammars method
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_grammars(self, target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
        if not target_versions:
            return GRAMMARS
        elif all(not self.is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
            # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
            return [
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
            ]
        else:
            return [pygram.python_grammar]
``` 

Note: This corrected code assumes that `is_python2` is intended to be a method of the same class. If it is not, then the `self` parameter should be removed from the function call within the `get_grammars` function.
