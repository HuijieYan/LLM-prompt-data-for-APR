The test case `test_python2_print_function` is attempting to use the function `fs` with the input parameters `source` and `mode=mode`. The expected behavior here is for the function `fs` to be called with these parameters and for the result to match the expected value. However, the error message indicates that an `InvalidInput` exception was raised within the `lib2to3_parse` function, leading to a failure in the test case.

Based on the error message, it seems that the issue lies within the implementation of the `lib2to3_parse` function, specifically in the `get_grammars` call within it. The code execution is reaching the `raise exc from None` line, indicating that an `InvalidInput` exception occurred during parsing.

The root cause of this issue could be related to the way the `get_grammars` function is handling the input argument `target_versions`. It seems that the function `get_grammars` is not correctly interpreting the provided `target_versions` argument, which is leading to the subsequent `InvalidInput` exception.

To fix this issue, firstly check the `get_grammars` function to ensure that it is correctly handling the input `target_versions` parameter. It should be able to process the specified Python versions and return the corresponding grammars as a result. Ensure that the `set` of `target_versions` is correctly parsed and used to fetch the appropriate grammars.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import pygram  # assuming pygram is imported from black module
from enum import Enum

# Assuming the definition of TargetVersion to be an instance of Enum
class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2
    # ... other versions ...

# Corrected 'get_grammars' function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[pygram]:
    GRAMMARS = []  # defined elsewhere
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version is not TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
