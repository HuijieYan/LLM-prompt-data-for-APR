The error occurs when the `lib2to3_parse` function is called with the `target_versions` argument. The problematic function `get_grammars` seems to be returning incorrect values which are not compatible with the `lib2to3_parse` function.

The potential error location within the `get_grammars` function is in the if-elif-else condition. The condition `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` might be returning unexpected results, leading to the wrong set of grammars being returned.

The bug occurs because the logic within the if-elif-else condition of the `get_grammars` function is not handling the `target_versions` correctly. It is not properly checking for Python 2 compatibility, which is leading to the wrong set of grammars being returned.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking Python 2 compatibility needs to be updated. The corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import TargetVersion, Grammar

# Corrected function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version is TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In the corrected function, the logic for checking Python 2 compatibility has been changed. Instead of using `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`, it checks if any of the `target_versions` is the Python 2 version. This should ensure that the correct set of grammars is returned based on Python 2 compatibility.
