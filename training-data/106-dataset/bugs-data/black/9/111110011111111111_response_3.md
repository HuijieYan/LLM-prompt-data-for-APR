The error seems to occur in the `get_grammars` function when it is called with the input `{<TargetVersion.PY27: 2>}`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source code related to the usage of the print function.

The reason behind the bug could be that the function is not correctly handling the case when the target version is set to Python 2 (PY27), which leads to an incorrect grammar being used for parsing the source code.

To fix the bug, the `get_grammars` function should return the correct set of grammars based on the target versions. If the target version is Python 2, it should return the list of Python 2 compatible grammars.

Additionally, the `pygram` module seems to be used to obtain the grammars, so it should be imported in the file where the function is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from enum import Enum
from lib2to3.pgen2 import grammar
from lib2to3 import pygram

class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2

class Grammar(Enum):
    # define the Grammar class if it's not already defined
    pass

GRAMMARS = []

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code:
1. The `pygram` module is assumed to be imported already.
2. The `TargetVersion` enum is used to check for Python 2 compatibility.
3. The `Grammar` class is assumed to already be defined and is appropriately referenced in the function signature and return type annotation.
4. The correct Python 2-compatible grammars are returned when the target version is Python 2. Otherwise, the default Python 3 grammar is returned.
