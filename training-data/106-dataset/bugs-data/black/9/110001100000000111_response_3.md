The bug is occurring in the function `get_grammars` where it returns different grammars based on the target versions provided.

The issue is that when the target_version is `py27`, the function is inserting unnecessary whitespace around the `print` statement.

The reason behind this bug is likely that the logic for handling Python 2-compatible code is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle the Python 2-compatible code properly and ensure that the whitespace around the `print` statement is handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[str]) -> List[str]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif 'py27' in target_versions:
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code, we are checking if `'py27'` is in the `target_versions` set and returning the appropriate grammars based on this condition. This should fix the bug and ensure that the unnecessary whitespace around the `print` statement is not inserted.
