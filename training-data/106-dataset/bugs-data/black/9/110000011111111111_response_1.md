Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the way the target_versions are being used to determine the grammar to use when parsing the source text.

Reasons for Bug Occurrence:
The buggy code evaluates the set of target_versions without taking into account that it might contain multiple versions. As a result, it fails to handle the potential scenario where more than one target version is included in the set.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the get_grammars function to handle multiple target versions from the input set as different scenarios.
2. Modify the conditional statements to properly handle cases where multiple target versions are present.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Iterable, Set, List
from lib2to3.pgen2 import grammar as pygram
from lib2to3.pgen2.parse import ParseError
from lib2to3.pytree import driver, pytree
from lib2to3.pytree.node import Node
from black import Grammar, TargetVersion

GRAMMARS = [... ]  # list of GRAMMARS

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version is TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
