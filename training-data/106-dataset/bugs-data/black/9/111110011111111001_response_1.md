The error message is directly associated with the failed test case. The error occurs when the `fs` function is called with the `source` and `mode` parameters.

Potential error location: 
The issue is likely related to the `get_grammars` function and how it handles the input parameter `target_versions`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `get_grammars` function returns different values based on whether the `target_versions` set is empty or not. If the set is not empty, it checks if all versions are not Python 2, and based on that, different grammars are returned. However, the issue arises from the `target_versions` being passed to the `get_grammars` function as a set, but the original function definition expects a `Set[TargetVersion]`. This mismatch likely leads to incorrect grammars being returned based on the evaluation of the conditions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `target_versions` type and value match the expected type `Set[TargetVersion]`.
2. Modify the conditions in the `get_grammars` function to evaluate the `target_versions` set correctly based on the presence of specific target versions.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from . import pygram  # Assuming the pygram module is imported from a specific module

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY2 for version in target_versions):
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
In the corrected code:
1. Imported modules or external references are assumed to be correctly specified.
2. The condition `version.is_python2()` is replaced with `version == TargetVersion.PY2`, assuming `TargetVersion.PY2` represents Python 2, based on the available information.
3. The `Set[TargetVersion]` type is correctly used in the function signature.
