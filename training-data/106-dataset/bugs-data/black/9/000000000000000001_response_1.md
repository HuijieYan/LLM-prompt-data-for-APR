Potential error location: The if condition `elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):` may not be evaluating as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- The bug occurs because the if condition may not be checking for all the target versions correctly, leading to unexpected results.
- Additionally, the function may not be handling the case where `target_versions` is not empty and contains a mix of Python 2 and Python 3 versions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of checking for all target versions in the `elif` condition, iterate through each version and check for Python 2 compatibility.
2. Consider handling cases where `target_versions` contains a mix of Python 2 and Python 3 versions.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    else:
        has_python2 = any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)
        if has_python2:
            # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
            return [
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
            ]
        else:
            return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
