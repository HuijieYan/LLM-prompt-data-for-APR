The error occurs because the `get_grammars` function is not defined properly, and it seems that the `is_python2` function should be a method of a class, as indicated by the `self` parameter. Additionally, the `is_python2` method should return a boolean value. 

To fix the bug, we need to define the `get_grammars` function properly and ensure that the `is_python2` method is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from enum import Enum

class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2

class Grammar:
    # placeholder for Grammar class
    pass

class pygram:
    python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement = "placeholder"
    python_grammar_no_print_statement = "placeholder"
    python_grammar = "placeholder"

# Define the class containing is_python2 method
class MyClass:
    def is_python2(self) -> bool:
        # omitted code
        return True  # Replace with actual logic to determine if it's Python 2

# Define the get_grammars function properly
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS  # Assuming GRAMMARS is a defined variable
    elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]

```

In this corrected code:
- The `is_python2` method is included inside a class called `MyClass`, and it returns a boolean value as expected.
- The `get_grammars` function is defined properly with the required parameters and return type.
- The placeholder classes and variables are added to ensure the code can be executed.

This should address the issue and prevent the error from occurring during the test case execution.
