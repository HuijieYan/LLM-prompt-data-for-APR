The buggy function is `get_grammars` and the error seems to be related to the `is_python2` method, which is not properly defined.

The `is_python2` method is referenced incorrectly within the `get_grammars` function. It is called as a method of the `version` object inside the list comprehension, but it should be called on the `version` object itself as if it were a method of `TargetVersion`.

To fix this bug, the `is_python2` method should be called directly on the `version` object, and the method definition should be adjusted to take into account the `TargetVersion` object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List

class Grammar:
    pass  # Placeholder for Grammar class

class TargetVersion:
    PY27 = 2

pygram = {
    'python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement': Grammar(),
    'python_grammar_no_print_statement': Grammar(),
    'python_grammar': Grammar()
}

def is_python2(version) -> bool:
    return version == 2

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram['python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement'],
            pygram['python_grammar_no_print_statement'],
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram['python_grammar']]
```

In this corrected code, `is_python2` is defined to take a version as input and return `True` if it's Python 2. The `get_grammars` function then calls this method correctly to check the version and return the appropriate grammars based on the version. Additionally, the `pygram` dictionary is defined to contain instances of the `Grammar` class, and the strings used as keys in the dictionary are corrected.
