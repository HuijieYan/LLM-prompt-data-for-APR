Potential error location: The `is_python2` method is referenced as `version.is_python2()`, but it is not defined within the current file or class.

Reasons for the bug: The `is_python2` method is being called on the `version` object, but there is no implementation for this method in the given code snippet. This is causing a ReferenceError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `is_python2` method within the appropriate class or file.
2. If the `is_python2` method is meant to check if a version is Python 2, then modify the function to use a different approach for checking the Python version of the target versions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from some_module import Grammar, TargetVersion
import pygram

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
