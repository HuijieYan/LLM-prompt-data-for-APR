The bug seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of the `get_grammars` function when the target version is set to `py27`. The issue description suggests that unnecessary whitespace is being added between `print` and `(` when using the `--target-version py27` option.

The potential error is likely in the conditional statement that checks for the target version. The bug occurs because the function `is_python2` is not being called to properly identify if the target version is `py27`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `is_python2` function to check if the target version is `py27` before returning the list of grammars.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from enum import Enum

class TargetVersion(Enum):
    PY27 = 2

class Grammar:
    pass

# dummy pygram class to illustrate the correct behavior
class pygram:
    python_grammar = Grammar()
    python_grammar_no_print_statement = Grammar()
    python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement = Grammar()

def is_python2(version: TargetVersion) -> bool:
    return version == TargetVersion.PY27

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected code, the `is_python2` function is properly called within the `get_grammars` function to check if the target version is `py27` before returning the list of grammars. This should fix the bug and ensure that the grammars are returned correctly based on the target version.
