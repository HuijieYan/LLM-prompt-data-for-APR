Potential error location: The error is likely in the section of the code that handles the Python 2-compatible code. It seems that the function is not returning the correct grammars based on the target versions input.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the target versions input to determine which grammar to return. As a result, unnecessary whitespace is being added around print().

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the logic for determining the target version and the associated grammars.
2. Make sure that the function correctly handles the target version input and returns the appropriate grammar based on the version.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import TargetVersion, pygram
from black.pygram import python_grammar, python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement, python_grammar_no_print_statement

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version in target_versions for version in (TargetVersion.PY2, TargetVersion.PY2_AND_PAREN)) or all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [python_grammar]
```
