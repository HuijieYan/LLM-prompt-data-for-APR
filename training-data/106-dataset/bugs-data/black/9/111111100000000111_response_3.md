Potential Error Location:
The issue in the function seems to be in the elif statement where it checks if all versions in the target_versions are not Python 2.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the function is_python2() is not implemented or called correctly. This means that the condition in the elif statement may not be evaluating as expected, leading to the incorrect return value.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the is_python2() method is implemented correctly and returns the expected values.
2. Check the implementation of the TargetVersion class to ensure that it provides the necessary information for the is_python2() method to work correctly.
3. Verify that the condition in the elif statement accurately evaluates whether the target versions are Python 2 compatible.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Set, List

# Assuming Grammar and TargetVersion classes have been properly defined elsewhere
def is_python2(self) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
