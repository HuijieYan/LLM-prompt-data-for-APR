Potential error location: The function `get_grammars` is trying to call a method `is_python2` on an object `version`, but it is not defined within the provided context.

Reasons for the bug: The `is_python2` method is not defined within the `get_grammars` function scope. It seems like it should be a method of the `TargetVersion` class, but it is currently being used as a standalone function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `is_python2` is intended to be a method of the `TargetVersion` class, it should be called as `version.is_python2()` within the `get_grammars` function.
2. If `is_python2` is not a method of the `TargetVersion` class, it should be defined as a standalone function and called accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Set

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
In this corrected code, the `is_python2` method has been replaced with a standalone function `is_python2`, which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase. The function is then called with the `version` object as its argument within the `get_grammars` function.
