Potential error location: The function is defined inside another function `is_python2` which is not indented correctly, and there are no defined imports for `Set`, `List`, `Grammar`, and `TargetVersion`.

Reason for the bug: The function `get_grammars` is not properly defined and is missing the necessary imports.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Indent the `get_grammars` function correctly, so that it is not nested within another function.
2. Import the necessary modules, such as `Set`, `List`, `Grammar`, and `TargetVersion` from the appropriate libraries.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# Updated function's signature with required imports
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```
