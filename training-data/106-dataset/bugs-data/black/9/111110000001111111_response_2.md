The problem with the provided function is that it always returns the same set of grammar rules if the `target_versions` set is not empty. This behavior is not consistent with the intention of the function, as it should return different grammar rules based on the target versions provided.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where `target_versions` contains the value `<TargetVersion.PY27: 2>`. This value corresponds to Python 2.7, and the function should return Python 2-compatible grammar rules in this case. However, the function does not handle this specific case correctly and always returns the same set of grammar rules for any non-empty `target_versions`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the specific case where `target_versions` contains Python 2.7 and return the appropriate grammar rules.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from <library_name> import Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so return Python 2 grammar rules.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

In this corrected function, we use `any` to check if any of the target versions in the set is Python 2.7. If so, we return the Python 2-compatible grammar rules. Otherwise, we return the Python 3 grammar rules. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and returns the correct grammar rules based on the target versions provided.
