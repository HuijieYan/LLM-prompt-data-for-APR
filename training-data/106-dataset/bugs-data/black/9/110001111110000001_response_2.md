The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source code due to the presence of print statements compatible with Python 2. It seems that the `get_grammars` function is not properly handling the identification of Python 2-compatible code.

The issue in the `get_grammars` function is that the `is_python2` method is being called incorrectly. The correct way to call it should be `version.is_python2()` rather than `version.is_python2`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `is_python2` method is not being called on a specific `version` object, but instead as an attribute of the class itself.

To fix this bug, the corrected code for the `get_grammars` method is provided below:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from black import Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
