Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely within the get_grammars function, specifically within the block that checks for Python 2 compatibility.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check for Python 2 compatibility is not properly implemented. It currently checks if all target versions are not Python 2, but it should be checking if any of the target versions are Python 2.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the conditional check to verify if any of the target versions are Python 2.
2. Use the any() function to check if any of the versions are Python 2.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import TargetVersion, Grammar

# assuming the GRAMMARS list is defined elsewhere
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
