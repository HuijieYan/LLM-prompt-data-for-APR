The error occurs in the `lib2to3_parse` function when the `get_grammars` function is called to get the grammars based on the target versions. The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source code related to the print function when using target version `PY27`.

The bug is likely caused by the logic in the `get_grammars` function for handling the target versions. It seems that when the target version is `PY27`, the function returns Python 2-compatible grammars, but it's not handling the transformation of the `print` statement properly.

To fix the bug, the `get_grammars` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the transformation of the `print` statement for Python 2. Additionally, it would be beneficial to test the function with different target versions to ensure it correctly handles the transformation for each version.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import pygram, Grammar, TargetVersion

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]

```

In the corrected code, a new Python grammar `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement` is returned when the target version is not Python 2. This grammar should handle the transformation of the `print` statement appropriately for the specified target versions.
