Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the part where it checks if the target version is Python 2.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` is not correctly checking if the target version is Python 2.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Change the condition to correctly check if the target version is Python 2.
- Ensure that the correct Python grammars are returned based on the target version.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from black.TargetVersion import TargetVersion
from black.Grammar import Grammar

# corrected function
def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
    if not target_versions:
        return GRAMMARS
    elif any(version == TargetVersion.PY27 for version in target_versions):
        # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
        return [
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
            pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
        ]
    else:
        return [pygram.python_grammar]
```
