The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `print()` function when using the `py27` target version. It seems that unnecessary whitespace is being added between `print` and `(`, causing the test case to fail.

The potential error location is within the `get_grammars` function, specifically in the section where it handles Python 2-compatible code.

The reason for this bug is likely due to the handling of the Python 2-compatible code in the `get_grammars` function. The function should not modify the code when using the `py27` target version, but it seems to be incorrectly adding whitespace.

To fix this bug, the `get_grammars` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the Python 2-compatible code and ensure that no unnecessary whitespace is added when using the `py27` target version.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grammars` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List

# assuming Grammar and TargetVersion classes are already defined

def is_python2(version: TargetVersion) -> bool:
    return version == TargetVersion.PY27

def get_grammars(target_versions: Set[TargetVersion]) -> List[Grammar]:
        if not target_versions:
            return GRAMMARS
        elif any(is_python2(version) for version in target_versions):
            # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.
            return [
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,
                pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,
            ]
        else:
            return [pygram.python_grammar]
```

By using the correct condition, `any(is_python2(version) for version in target_versions)`, we ensure that the correct grammars are returned based on the presence of the `py27` target version. This should fix the bug regarding unnecessary whitespace being added around the `print` function.
