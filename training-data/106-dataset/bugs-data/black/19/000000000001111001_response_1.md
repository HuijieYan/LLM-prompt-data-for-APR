The current approach has a few issues. The main problem is the inconsistent use of `Tuple[int, int]` as a return type, which does not align with the actual returned values in the code. Additionally, the logic within the function has cases where 'return' statements are not properly handling the cases based on the conditions checked.

Given these issues, the function should be updated to ensure that the return type matches the format of the actual returned values and the conditional 'return' statements should handle all possible cases based on the conditions checked.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return (0, 0)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return (newlines, 0)

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before, 1)

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1, 0)

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1, 0)

    return (before, 0)
```

In this corrected version, the return types and the handling of conditions with 'return' statements are updated to ensure consistency and proper handling of all possible cases.
