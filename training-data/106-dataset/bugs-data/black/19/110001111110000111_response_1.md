The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` because the `assertEqual` method is comparing two strings that contain a different number of newlines before and after the `@property` decorator. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may not be correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after decorator statements.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be in the conditional statements that determine the number of newlines to be inserted before and after different types of lines.

The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function does not accurately calculate and insert the appropriate number of empty lines before and after decorator statements, resulting in an incorrect formatting output.

Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the conditional statements within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being calculated and inserted for each type of line.
2. Adding additional checks for edge cases where decorators, imports, or other types of lines are followed by or preceded by certain line types.
3. Considering the specific formatting requirements for decorators and adjusting the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

# ... (other functions)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import()
            and not current_line.is_import()
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield()
            and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditions for `is_import` and `is_yield` have been updated to call the corresponding methods and appropriate changes have been made for the conditions related to decorators and other line types.
