The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of empty lines that should be added before the current line of code, as well as a flag indicating whether a new line is needed after the current line. It takes into account various conditions such as line indentation, type of line (decorator, flow control, etc.), previous definitions, and more, to determine the correct number of empty lines.

Looking at the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the issue seems to be related to the conditional statements and the logic of setting the `before` variable.

The function has multiple conditional blocks that set the `newlines` variable, but the return statement seems to be inconsistent. Additionally, the assignment of `before` in the conditional statements is overwriting the calculated value which might lead to incorrect results.

To fix the function, we need to carefully review the conditional blocks along with the logic of setting `before` and `newlines` to ensure they function correctly as per the expected test case values and types.

Below is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and 
            current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (1 if 1 else max_allowed), 0
    elif (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
            (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (1 if 1 else max_allowed), 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditional blocks have been rearranged and the `before` and `newlines` variables are set accordingly based on the different conditions. The logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been adjusted to return the appropriate values based on the input parameters and conditions.
