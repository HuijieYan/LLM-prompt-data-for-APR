The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for updating the "before" variable. 

The bug in the original code seems to be related to the logic for updating the "before" variable. The code attempts to calculate the number of empty lines that should be placed before and after the currently processed line, but the logic for updating the "before" variable based on various conditions is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for updating the "before" variable and ensure that it correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected/updated version of the function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, we modified the logic for updating the "before" variable to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line based on the specified conditions. Additionally, we also updated the method calls to `is_import()` and `is_yield()` to ensure that the correct method is being called to check the conditions.
