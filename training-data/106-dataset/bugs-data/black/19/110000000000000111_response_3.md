Potential error location: 
The bug seems to be occurring in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The conditional statements that handle different cases might not be properly calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect conditional logic or incorrect variable assignments in the function. This could be causing the function to return the wrong number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Review and correct the conditional statements to ensure they correctly calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted.
2. Check the variable assignments and ensure they are performing the correct calculations for the number of empty lines.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return (newlines, 0)  # corrected return statement to return a tuple

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before, 1)  # corrected return statement to return a tuple

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1, 0)  # corrected return statement to return a tuple

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1, 0)  # corrected return statement to return a tuple

    return (before, 0)  # corrected return statement to return a tuple
