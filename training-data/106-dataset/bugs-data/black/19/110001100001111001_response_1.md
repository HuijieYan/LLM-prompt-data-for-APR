The problematic function appears to have logical issues in handling certain conditions. The code fails to properly account for various conditional scenarios and likely needs a more comprehensive approach to address each scenario.

The initial condition in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function sets `max_allowed` to 1 and then conditionally changes it to 2 based on the `depth` of `current_line`. However, this switch appears to be problematic, especially as the newlines are set differently based on the reasons for the condition. The function then checks if there are decorators, definition, or classes, setting `previous_defs` and then performs various conditional checks.

The code likely fails because of complex conditional checks and does not properly handle each conditional scenario.

To fix this, the code can be refactored to contain explicit conditional branches that address each scenario with clarity. This restructuring would help to isolate and address each issue effectively.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not current_line.leaves:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        else:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line:        
            if current_line.is_flow_control:
                return 0, 1
            
            if (
                self.previous_line.is_import
                and not current_line.is_import
                and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
            ):
                return (max_allowed or 1), 0
            
            if (
                self.previous_line.is_yield
                and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
            ):
                return (max_allowed or 1), 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed) if first_leaf.prefix else 0
    first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    return before, 0
```
