The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing, showing a comparison between the expected and actual outputs. The error points to a discrepancy in the number of newlines present in the output.

Looking at the `maybe_empty_lines` function, the issue may be related to how it handles the insertion of empty lines before certain types of lines, such as decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of newlines and the conditions for their insertion. Specifically, the logic for inserting newlines based on different line types or depth levels seems to be flawed, leading to an incorrect number of newlines being added before and after certain lines.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the number of newlines to be added before and after specific line types needs to be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the requirements of each particular case.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 1
```

In this corrected function, the logic for inserting newlines has been revised to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the conditions specified. This should address the issue observed in the test case.
