# buggy class docstring

```text
Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
