The error seems to be related to formatting issues in the code. The `assertFormatEqual` method is comparing the expected output with the actual output from the `fs` function and is failing due to mismatched formatting.

Looking at the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, the issue is likely related to the handling of newlines and prefixes. It seems like there might be inconsistency in the way newlines and prefixes are handled, leading to the formatting mismatch.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newlines and prefixes based on different conditions and types of lines.

Here's the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
            return max(newlines, 0), 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif (self.previous_line
          and self.previous_line.is_import
          and not current_line.is_import
          and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    elif (self.previous_line
          and self.previous_line.is_yield
          and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    else:
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of newlines and prefixes has been standardized and the conditions have been rewritten to ensure that consistent formatting is applied. This should address the formatting mismatch issue observed in the test case.
