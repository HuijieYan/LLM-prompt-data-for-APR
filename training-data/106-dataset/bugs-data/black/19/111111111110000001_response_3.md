The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with the error message:

```

```

From the error message, it seems that the formatting of the output does not match the expected result. This discrepancy in indentation and newline characters could be caused by the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, particularly in the logic related to handling decorators and yields.

The actual function `_maybe_empty_lines` is trying to determine the number of empty lines to add before and after the current line, based on conditions such as whether it's a decorator, a flow control statement, etc. The issue with the code is that the conditions for handling decorators, yields, and imports are not correctly implemented, as it's not considering the indentation level or the previous line in some cases.

To fix the bug, the conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function need to be carefully reviewed and revised. The logic for handling decorators, yields, imports, and flow control statements should consider the current line, the previous line, and the indentation level for determining the number of empty lines to add.

Given these considerations, here's the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the comparisons for `is_import` and `is_yield` have been fixed by adding function calls and considering the depth of the current and previous lines. This should address the issues with the faulty logic in the original function and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is added before and after the current line.
