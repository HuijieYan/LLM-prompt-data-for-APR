The error is occurring because the function is not producing the correct output. The `assertFormatEqual` method is comparing the expected and actual outputs and finding differences in the number of empty lines.

The potential error in the function is that the logic for adding empty lines seems to be incorrect. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks for various conditions like decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields, as well as the depth of the current line to decide how many empty lines should be added.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for adding empty lines based on the conditions and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned for each case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, previous_line: Optional[Line]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if previous_line is None or previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif previous_line and previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif previous_line and previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return 0, 0
```

In this corrected code, we have restructured the conditions to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the docstring of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The correct number of empty lines is now determined for each specific case, and the function should now produce the expected output.
