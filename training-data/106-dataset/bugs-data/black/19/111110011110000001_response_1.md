The error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` function is caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual values. The expected and actual values are not equal, leading to an assertion error.

Upon analyzing the provided `EmptyLineTracker` class and the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, it seems that the bug might be related to the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method seems to have multiple conditional branches, and the computation of empty lines is not aligning with the expected behavior, leading to the test case failure.

One approach to fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method could be to review the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The conditions and their corresponding return values should be revisited to ensure they accurately reflect the required behavior, as evidenced by the failing test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        # ... existing logic ...
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            if all([not current_line.is_decorator, self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator]):
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        # Default case
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected code, the conditional branches have been reviewed, and the computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line has been adjusted to align with the expected behavior.
