Potential error location: The bug may be occurring when checking if the current character is '\n' and if the current line is empty.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The conditional check for '\n' is not considering the case where the current line is empty.
- The function is not properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a new line.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a new line.
- Check if the current line is not empty before determining whether to consume the prefix.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
