The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is the logic for handling newlines. 

Currently, the function is not properly keeping track of the current column position or correctly handling newlines. It fails to correctly update the current_column variable when encountering newlines and also does not properly handle waiting for a newline after encountering an indent.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling newlines and the counting of column positions.

Here's the corrected code for the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1

        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
