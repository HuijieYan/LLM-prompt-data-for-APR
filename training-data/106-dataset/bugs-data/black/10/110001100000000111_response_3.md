Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the logic handling the indentation and newline characters, as it is responsible for correctly preserving the indentation level for comments.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the mishandling of indentation levels when encountering tab characters and newlines, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the indentation level is preserved when encountering a dedent and a comment.
3. Properly handle the transition from one line to the next, preserving the correct indentation level.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update to correctly handle tab characters
            current_column += 4
            while current_column % 8 != 0:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
