The issue in the provided function is that it incorrectly handles the indentation when encountering tab characters. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. 

The potential error location within the function is in the elif condition for tab characters (\t) where the current_column is incremented by 4 instead of considering the tab size.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling tab characters (\t) correctly, causing the incorrect calculation of the current_column.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the current_column increment for tab characters to consider the actual tab size. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))  # adjust for tab size
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function properly handles tab characters by adjusting the current_column and current_line when encountering a tab, ensuring the correct calculation of the indentation level.
