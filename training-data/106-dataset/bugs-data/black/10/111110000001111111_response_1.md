The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have issues with handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function incorrectly adjusts the current indentation level, resulting in inconsistent indentation for tabulated comments.

The issue occurs because the function doesn't properly handle the case where indentation changes from tabs to spaces or vice versa. It also doesn't consider the indentation level when processing the prefix.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation level and the type of indentation used (tabs or spaces).

Here's the corrected code for the `Driver` class:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # assuming 4 spaces for each tab
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                # Check if the next line continues the same indentation
                if len(lines) > 0 and lines[-1].startswith('\t') and not current_line.startswith('\t'):
                    current_column = len(lines[-1]) // 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to handle the transition from tabs to spaces and vice versa, and also to correctly determine the current indentation level for each line. Additionally, we have introduced a fix to ensure that the next line continues the same indentation level as the previous line.
