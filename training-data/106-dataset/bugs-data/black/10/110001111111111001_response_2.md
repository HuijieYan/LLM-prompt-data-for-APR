The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix`. The error occurs because the function does not handle the case where `wait_for_nl` is `True` and the remaining characters in the prefix do not reach the specified column. This causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the for loop to properly handle the case when `wait_for_nl` is `True` and the remaining characters do not reach the specified column.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
