The error message is being generated by the test function `test_comment_indentation`. It seems that the test is comparing the expected and actual formatted contents, and they are not matching. The error message specifically mentions an indentation issue for a comment.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic that handles the indentation and new lines. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying when a comment is dedented and waiting for a new line.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the indentation and new lines when parsing the prefix string.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic that handles the indentation and new lines to correctly identify when a comment is dedented.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Dedent the comment
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code includes handling the new line characters to properly dedent the comment and ensure that the indentation is maintained as expected.
