The test case `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the formatted contents with tabs and spaces. The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual values do not match. The error is occurring in the `fs` function, which is likely using the `_partially_consume_prefix` method.

The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` method is the logic for handling indentation and newline characters. 

The bug occurs because the function does not accurately handle the cases where the indentation level requires different numbers of spaces and tabs to match. The function also does not correctly handle comments with different indentation levels.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling spaces and tabs need to be modified to accurately calculate the current column based on the input prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code adjusts the handling of spaces and tabs to accurately calculate the current column and correctly handle cases where the indentation level requires different numbers of spaces and tabs to match.
