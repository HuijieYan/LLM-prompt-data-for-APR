Potential error location: The issue may be occurring in the logic for checking if the current column is less than the specified column.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The logic for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is incomplete.
2. The function is not properly handling the case where the prefix doesn't contain any newlines.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check before returning the result to handle the case where there are no newlines in the prefix.
2. Refactor the logic for checking the current column against the specified column.

Corrected code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(res) + len(current_line):]
                    return res, remaining_prefix

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
