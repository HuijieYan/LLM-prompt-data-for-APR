The error seems to be in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the `BlackTestCase` class. It is comparing the expected and actual outputs of `fs(contents_tab)` and `contents_spc` in the `test_comment_indentation` test case. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs do not match.

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be in the logic related to handling the indentation and comments. The approach taken to track the current column and indent level using `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` might not be accurate.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the logic related to handling whitespace characters, counting the column, and identifying the continuation of the line.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # non-whitespace character, reset wait_for_nl
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected code, the change is made to the logic for handling newline characters and resetting `wait_for_nl` appropriately. Additionally, the count for tab characters is changed to 4, assuming a 4-space tab width. These changes should address the bug and correct the function's behavior.
