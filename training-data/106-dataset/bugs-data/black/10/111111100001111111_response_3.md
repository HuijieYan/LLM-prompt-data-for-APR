The issue with the provided function is that the logic to handle indentation levels is incorrect, specifically with tabs. When a tab character is encountered, the current_column is being incremented by 1 instead of 4. Additionally, the logic for checking for a new line (char == '\n') is not correctly handling the indentation level and wait_for_nl flag.

To fix this bug, the logic needs to be updated to correctly handle tab characters and new lines while maintaining the correct indentation level for comments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels for both spaces and tabs, and the associated test cases are expected to pass with the updated logic.
