The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` function is called with the `contents_tab` as the first argument and `contents_spc` as the second argument. The test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the expected and actual outputs do not match.

The potential error in the problematic function `_partially_consume_prefix` is within the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. It seems that the condition is not correctly handling the comparison between the current column and the desired column.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the indentation levels when consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect behavior when dealing with comments that should be indented the same as the next line.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the current indentation level and correctly handle the indentation of the comments.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted the condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
