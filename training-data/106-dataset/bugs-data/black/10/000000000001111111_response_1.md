## Issue Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing this problem due to the way it handles tab characters and spaces.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is within the logic for processing tab characters and spaces in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It seems to be mishandling the indentation level under certain conditions.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation level when processing tab characters and spaces. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic for processing tab characters and spaces to accurately calculate the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation level when processing new lines and tabs.
3. Consider refactoring the logic for handling indentation to make it more robust and accurate.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code:
- The logic for processing tab characters has been updated to add 4 to the `current_column` for each tab character, assuming 4 spaces for each tab.
- The handling of newlines has been modified to ensure that the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags are reset appropriately.

These changes should help address the bug related to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
