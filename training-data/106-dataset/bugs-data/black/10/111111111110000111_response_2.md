The error message in the test function is an assertion error in the `test_comment_indentation` method which compares the expected and actual values. The error occurs because the indentation for the comments is not being handled correctly.

The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, which is the buggy function. The issue arises from incorrect handling of indentation in the `prefix` string.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the indentation level for comments. It only accounts for spaces and tabs, but does not correctly handle comments, resulting in incorrect indentation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle comment indentation properly. This can be achieved by identifying comment lines and adjusting the indentation accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # adjust indentation for comments
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` method should now handle comment indentation correctly, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
