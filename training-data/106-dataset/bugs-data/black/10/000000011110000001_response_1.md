Potential error location: The bug is likely in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, particularly in the logic that handles wait_for_nl and current_column incrementing.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug appears to occur because the logic for wait_for_nl and handling newlines and indentation is not functioning as expected. This is resulting in incorrect handling of the prefix and columns.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fix this bug is to rewrite the logic for handling newlines and indentation. Additionally, separating the logic for handling tabs and spaces could improve readability and maintainability.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
