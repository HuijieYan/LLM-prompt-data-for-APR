The potential error in the provided function is the logic for handling indentation and new lines. The function is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. However, the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a new line is causing the function to return incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation level and new lines, causing it to return incorrect results. Additionally, the logic for updating the current column and waiting for a new line is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for tracking the current column, adding new lines to the lines list, and waiting for new lines.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab size is 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code includes handling new lines properly, updating the current column based on spaces and tabs, and adding the current line to the lines list when encountering a new line. This should resolve the issues with the original function and provide the expected results.
