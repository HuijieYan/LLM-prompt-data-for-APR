The issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely causing the buggy behavior. The function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix and returning the consumed prefix along with the remaining prefix. It seems that the function is not handling tab characters (\t) correctly when calculating the current column.

The bug occurs because the current_column is not properly updated when encountering tab characters. As a result, the function incorrectly calculates the indentation level, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_column is updated properly when encountering tab characters. We can update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly calculate the indentation level.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces equivalent to the tab
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            for _ in range(spaces):
                current_line += ' '
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, we have added logic to handle tab characters by calculating the number of spaces equivalent to the tab and updating the current_column accordingly. This ensures that the current_column accurately represents the indentation level, fixing the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
