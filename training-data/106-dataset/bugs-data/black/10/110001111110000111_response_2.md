The error message from the test function `test_comment_indentation` indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing, specifically for the `contents_tab` variable. It shows that the expected and actual outputs are not matching, and the indentation of the comment is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. The code is not handling the indentation properly, especially when there is a mix of spaces and tabs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation correctly. It does not consider the mix of tabs and spaces when calculating the current column.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Properly handling the indentation by counting the number of spaces and tabs in the current line.
2. Implement a separate logic for handling tabs and spaces for indentations.
3. Consider refactoring the code to use a standard library or external package that provides better support for handling indentation.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation has been improved. The `current_column` is now calculated taking into account both spaces and tabs. Also, the code now properly handles unexpected empty lines by resetting the `current_column` and appending the current line to `lines`.
