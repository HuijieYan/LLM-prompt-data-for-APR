The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation. The test case `test_comment_indentation` is failing due to the incorrect indentation of the comments.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it appears that the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a new line is not properly implemented. This is causing the incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly tracking the column position and waiting for a new line when encountering spaces or tabs. As a result, when the input contains tabs for indentation, the function does not handle the indentation level properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to rewrite the logic for tracking the indentation level and waiting for a new line. Specifically, handling the tab character and its impact on the column position should be improved.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust column position based on current indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the tab character has been improved to adjust the column position based on the current indentation level. This should address the incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation.
