The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of indentation using tabs. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix (string) based on a given column number. However, it fails to correctly handle indentation with tabs, leading to incorrect behavior when processing tabulated comments after a dedent.

The bug is likely occurring at the sections of the code where the function checks for tab ('\t') characters and calculates the current column indentation. The function incorrectly adds 4 to the current column for each tab character, whereas it should only add 1 to align with the standard tab width.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle tab characters and compute the current column based on the actual tab width.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4 for consistency in the codebase
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width  # Add the tab width to the current column
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correct tab width (in this case, 4) when processing tab characters, the function will now correctly handle indentation and consume the prefix based on the given column number.
