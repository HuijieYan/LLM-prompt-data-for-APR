The error seems to be occurring in the `test_comment_indentation` function. The test is failing with an assertion error because the `assertFormatEqual` method is comparing two strings and finding them not equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is happening on line 517 and 156 of the `test_black.py` file.

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have an issue with handling the indentation and the comment. It's not correctly detecting the prefix and consuming the prefix until the specified column.

The issue is likely to be in the logic that identifies and consumes the prefix until the specific column before splitting the comment from the code.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly consume the prefix until the specified column and handle comments properly.

Here's the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` method:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = prefix.split("\n")
    lines_to_check = []
    for line in lines:
        if len(line.expandtabs()) <= column:
            lines_to_check.append(line)
        else:
            break
    prefix_consumed = "\n".join(lines_to_check)

    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(prefix_consumed):]
    return prefix_consumed, remaining_prefix
```

With this corrected code, the `_partially_consume_prefix` method should now correctly consume the prefix until the specified column and handle comments properly when used in the test scenario provided.
