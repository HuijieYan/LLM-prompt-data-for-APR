The error occurs because the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent. The function is not preserving the original indentation level of the comments after a dedent operation.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the indentation of comments after a dedent needs to be adjusted. The function should correctly preserve the original indentation level of the comments after a dedent.

Below is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, the logic for handling comments after a dedent has been updated to correctly preserve the original indentation level. Additionally, the logic for returning the remaining prefix has been updated to avoid unnecessary concatenation while maintaining the correct indentation.

This updated function should resolve the issue and ensure correct indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
