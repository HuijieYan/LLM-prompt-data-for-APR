Potential error location: The issue seems to be with how the function handles indentation and new lines, especially when tabs are used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not correctly handling the indentation levels when tabs are used, and it improperly processes new lines and indents.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a consistent method for handling both tabs and spaces for indentation.
2. Make sure that the function properly handles new lines and indentation levels.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
