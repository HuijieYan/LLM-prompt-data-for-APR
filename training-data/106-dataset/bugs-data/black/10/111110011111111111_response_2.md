The bug is occurring in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method of the `Driver` class. The method is intended to partially consume a prefix while keeping track of the current column and line of the input. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabs and spaces in the input.

The error message from the test function indicates that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is being changed incorrectly after a dedent. This means that the indentation for comments is not being handled properly, especially when the input file uses tabs.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles the indentation and consumption of the prefix. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the tab and space characters, leading to improper indentation of comments after a dedent.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tab and space characters in the input prefix needs to be corrected. Additionally, the logic for tracking line/column positions needs to be adjusted to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

Here's the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` method of the `Driver` class:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if len(current_line.strip()) > 0:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    if len(current_line.strip()) > 0 and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling tab and space characters has been adjusted to correctly increment the `current_column` value. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a new line has been adjusted to handle the indentation of comments after a dedent more effectively.
