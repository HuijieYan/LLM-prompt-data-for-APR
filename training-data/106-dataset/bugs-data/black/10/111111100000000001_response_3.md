Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:`. It looks like it is checking if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than a given value. 

Reason for the bug: The current implementation doesn't handle the case when the last line of the prefix is less than the given column value. The condition `current_column < column` fails to account for this scenario.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if we are at the end of the string and the current line is not empty, in which case we should return it.
2. Modify the loop to handle the end of the string more gracefully.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Fix for the last line being less than the given column value
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
