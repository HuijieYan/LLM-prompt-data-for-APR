The buggy function `is_gzipped` checks if the response is gzipped by comparing the value of the 'Content-Type' header to specific gzip content types. However, the comparison does not account for additional content types that may include charset information.

The bug occurs because the function is only checking for an exact match with the content types 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', but in the provided test case, the content type includes additional charset information.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' instead of doing an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this change, the function will now correctly identify responses with content types that start with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' as gzipped.
