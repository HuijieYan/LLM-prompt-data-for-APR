The test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` is creating a `Response` object with a `Content-Type` header of `"application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8"`. The expected outcome is for the `is_gzipped` function to return `True` for this input, but it currently returns `False`.

The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header value with `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`. In this comparison, the function does not take into account cases where the `Content-Type` header would include a `charset`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function only checks for the exact match of the `Content-Type` header with the expected values, and it does not handle cases where additional parameters (such as `charset`) are included in the header value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to handle cases where the `Content-Type` header may include additional parameters like `charset`. We can do this by splitting the `Content-Type` header value based on the semicolon (`;`) and only comparing the first part with `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    ctype_value = ctype.split(b';')[0]
    return ctype_value in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle `Content-Type` headers that include additional parameters like `charset`.
