Potential Error:
The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is that it checks for the Content-Type header to determine if the response is gzipped. However, the correct header to check for gzip encoding is 'Content-Encoding'.

Reason for the Bug:
The function is checking for the wrong header (Content-Type instead of Content-Encoding) to determine if the response is gzipped.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the 'Content-Encoding' header instead of 'Content-Type' header to determine if the response is gzipped.
2. Use the 'gzip' value in the 'Content-Encoding' header to check if the response is gzipped.

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'')
    return b'gzip' in content_encoding
```
