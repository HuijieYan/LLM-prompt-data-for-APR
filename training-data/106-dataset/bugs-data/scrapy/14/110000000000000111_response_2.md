The error occurs because the function is_gzipped only checks for the Content-Type values 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', and does not account for cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

In the corrected code, we use the any() function to check if any of the specified Content-Type values are present in the response headers, allowing the function to handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like 'charset'.
