Potential error:
The function is comparing the Content-Type of the response to check if it is gzipped, but the correct header to check for gzip encoding is 'Content-Encoding'.

Reason for the bug:
The function is checking the incorrect header ('Content-Type') to determine if the response is gzipped.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the 'Content-Encoding' header of the response to determine if it is gzipped.
2. Use the `requests` library's built-in method to check if the response is gzipped.

Corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    return response.headers.get('Content-Encoding') == 'gzip'
```
