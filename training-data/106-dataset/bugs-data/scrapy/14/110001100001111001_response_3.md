The buggy function `is_gzipped` is intended to check if the response is gzipped based on the 'Content-Type' header. However, it only checks for specific 'Content-Type' values and does not consider variations such as charset or other parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly identify gzipped content by checking if the 'Content-Encoding' header includes 'gzip' and not just the 'Content-Type' header.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'')
    return b'gzip' in content_encoding
```

With this modification, the function will now accurately check if the response is gzipped based on the 'Content-Encoding' header instead of the 'Content-Type' header.
