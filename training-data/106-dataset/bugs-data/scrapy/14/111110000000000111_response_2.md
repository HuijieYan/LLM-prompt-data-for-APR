Potential error location:
The problem lies in the comparison of the Content-Type header with the expected values for gzip compression. The current comparison does not take into account the possibility of a charset being included in the Content-Type header.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current function does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as charset. This leads to incorrect detection of whether the response is gzipped or not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the comparison in the function to correctly handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as charset. One approach could be to parse the Content-Type header and extract only the media type ('application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip') for comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(';')[0]
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```
In the corrected code, we split the Content-Type header by the ';' character and take only the media type portion for comparison. This allows the function to correctly detect gzip compression even when the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as charset.
