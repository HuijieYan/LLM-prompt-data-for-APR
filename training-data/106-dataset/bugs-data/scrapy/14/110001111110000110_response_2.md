# Corrected function code

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_14/scrapy/utils/gz.py

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype == b'application/gzip'
```

The issue with the original function is that it only checked for an exact match of the Content-Type header, which caused it to return False when the header included a charset. The corrected function now checks if the Content-Type header starts with 'application/x-gzip' or if it is exactly 'application/gzip', which covers the case where the header includes a charset as well.

This correction should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
