Potential error location: The `is_gzipped` function does not handle cases where the `Content-Type` header includes the charset information.

Reasons behind the bug: The `is_gzipped` function only checks for the specific `Content-Type` values of `application/x-gzip` and `application/gzip`, but does not handle cases where additional information like `charset` is included in the header.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `is_gzipped` function to account for cases where the `Content-Type` header includes additional information such as `charset`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

By using the `any` function, we can check if either `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` is present in the `Content-Type` header, without disregarding any additional information such as `charset`. This should fix the bug described in the test case and issue.
