The problem with the provided function is that it only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, but it does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like 'charset'.

The potential error location within the function is the line that checks if the Content-Type header is in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'). This check does not take into account the possibility of additional parameters in the Content-Type header.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is_gzipped does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function is_gzipped to check for the presence of 'gzip' in the Content-Encoding header rather than matching the entire Content-Type header.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'')
    return b'gzip' in content_encoding
```

With this modification, the function will check for 'gzip' in the Content-Encoding header, which will handle cases where the header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'. This should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly identify gzipped responses.
