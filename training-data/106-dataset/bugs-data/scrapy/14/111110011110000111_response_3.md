1. The test case is checking if the `is_gzipped` function correctly identifies a response as gzipped when the Content-Type header includes a charset parameter.

2. The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the expected values for gzip content type.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_gzipped` function only checks for an exact match of the `Content-Type` header with 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', without considering any additional parameters such as the charset.

4. Possible approach for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `is_gzipped` function to correctly handle cases where the `Content-Type` header includes additional parameters like charset.
   - Instead of doing an exact match, the function should check if the `Content-Type` header starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
