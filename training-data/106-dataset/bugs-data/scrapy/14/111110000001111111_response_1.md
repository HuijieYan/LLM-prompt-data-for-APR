The problem in the `is_gzipped` function lies in the comparison of the `Content-Type` header. The function is checking for an exact match with `application/x-gzip`, but it should account for cases where the header includes additional information such as the character encoding.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not considering variations in the `Content-Type` header, leading to incorrect detection of gzipped content.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the `Content-Type` header starts with `application/x-gzip`, ignoring any additional parameters such as the charset.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip')
```
