The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is due to the fact that it only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, and doesn't account for cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check only for 'gzip' in the Content-Type header, as 'gzip' is the common substring for both 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

This modification will account for cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset, and will correctly identify if the response is gzipped.
