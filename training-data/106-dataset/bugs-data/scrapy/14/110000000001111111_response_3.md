The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is that it only checks for exact matches of 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header. It does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters, such as 'charset=utf-8'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check for partial matches of 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, ignoring any additional parameters. We can achieve this by splitting the Content-Type header and checking only the first part of it.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype.decode('utf-8') for x in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip'))
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly identify 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8' as gzipped.
