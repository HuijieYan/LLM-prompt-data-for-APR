The bug is occurring in the `is_gzipped` function. The function is checking if the content type is either `'application/x-gzip'` or `'application/gzip'`. However, in the input parameters for the test case, the content type is `'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'`, which does not match either of the expected content types.

This is causing the function to return `False`, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check for the presence of `'application/x-gzip'` or `'application/gzip'` within the content type string, rather than looking for an exact match.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the function will return `True` if the content type includes 'gzip' and `False` otherwise, which matches the expected behavior.

This should resolve the assertion error in the test case.
