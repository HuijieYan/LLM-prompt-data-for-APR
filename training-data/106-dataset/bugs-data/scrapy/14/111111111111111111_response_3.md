The bug is likely occurring because the function `is_gzipped` only checks for the exact Content-Type values 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', but not for variations such as 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'. This leads to the function returning False instead of True when the Content-Type header includes the charset.

To fix this bug, the function `is_gzipped` needs to be updated to check for variations of the Content-Type header that include the charset. One approach to fix this bug is to modify the function to check if 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' is present in the Content-Type header, rather than matching the exact values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
``` 

Using the corrected function, when the input parameters are: 
- response.headers: `{b'Content-Type': [b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8']}`
- response: `<200 http://www.example.com>`

the function will correctly return `True`, resolving the bug.
