The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function is that it checks for the exact content type match of 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', but it does not account for additional parameters in the Content-Type header such as 'charset=utf-8'.

The reason for the bug is that the function only checks for an exact match of the content type, and does not consider additional parameters included in the Content-Type header.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', instead of checking for an exact match.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

This modification will allow the function to correctly identify responses with the 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' content types, even if additional parameters such as 'charset=utf-8' are included in the Content-Type header.
