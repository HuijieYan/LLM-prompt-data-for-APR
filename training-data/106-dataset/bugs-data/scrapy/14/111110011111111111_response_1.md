The test case is creating a Response object with a Content-Type header of "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8", and then it's calling the is_gzipped function with this Response object. The expected outcome is that is_gzipped should return True, indicating that the response is gzipped. However, the actual outcome is False, which leads to an AssertionError in the test.

The issue is within the is_gzipped function. The function checks if the Content-Type header is equal to either b'application/x-gzip' or b'application/gzip'. However, since the Content-Type header in the test case includes a charset parameter, the comparison fails and the function returns False.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the is_gzipped function to consider the case when the Content-Type header includes a charset parameter. We can do this by checking if the Content-Type header starts with either "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip".

Here's the corrected code for the is_gzipped function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
