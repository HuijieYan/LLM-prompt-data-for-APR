Potential error location: 
The error is occurring because the function `is_gzipped` is checking for an exact match with the Content-Type header, while in the test case, the header includes a charset (i.e., `;charset=utf-8`), causing the function to return False.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function does not account for cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as charset. As a result, it fails to correctly identify the "application/x-gzip" content type when additional parameters are present.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to check for a partial match instead of an exact match between the Content-Type header and the expected strings.
2. Use a regular expression to match the Content-Type header, allowing for additional parameters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return re.match(r'application/(x-)?gzip', ctype.decode()) is not None
```
In the corrected code, we use a regular expression to match the Content-Type header, allowing for additional parameters such as charset. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the "application/x-gzip" content type even when additional parameters are present.
