The potential error in the function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the expected values, `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`. The error occurs because the actual `Content-Type` header includes the charset, so the comparison fails.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if the `Content-Type` header contains `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` regardless of the charset.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

This code uses the `any` function to check if either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'` is present in the `Content-Type` header, regardless of the presence of a charset. This should fix the issue and make the function return `True` for `Content-Type: application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8`.
