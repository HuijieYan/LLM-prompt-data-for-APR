The error in the `is_gzipped` function stems from the fact that it checks for an exact match of the Content-Type header with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`. 

The bug occurs because the function does not account for cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset parameter.

To fix this bug, the `is_gzipped` function needs to check if the content type starts with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` rather than checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '').split(';')[0]
    return ctype.strip() in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
```

This corrected function will consider the possibility of the Content-Type header including other parameters, such as the charset, and only compare the actual content type.
