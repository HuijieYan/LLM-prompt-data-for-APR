The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the expected values `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`. 

The bug occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for an exact match of `Content-Type` with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, while in the provided test case, the `Content-Type` header includes the additional parameter `charset=utf-8`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to check for the presence of `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` in the `Content-Type` header, regardless of any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

This modification uses the `any` function to check if any of the specified content types are present in the `Content-Type` header, allowing for the presence of additional parameters like `charset=utf-8`.
