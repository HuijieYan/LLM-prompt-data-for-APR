The potential error location within the function is in the comparison of the Content-Type header with the accepted values. 

The bug occurs because the function `is_gzipped` only checks for exact matches of 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header. When the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like 'charset=utf-8', the function fails to recognize it as a gzip content type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the Content-Type header starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', ignoring any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
