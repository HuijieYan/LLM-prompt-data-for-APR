The buggy function `is_gzipped` checks if the response is gzipped by comparing the 'Content-Type' header with a couple of predefined values for gzipped content types. 

The bug occurs because the buggy function only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' as valid content types, but in the test case, the 'Content-Type' header includes the additional charset information ('charset=utf-8'), making it different from the predefined content types. 

To fix this, the function should check if the 'Content-Type' header contains 'gzip' in it instead of doing strict equality checks with predefined values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this change, the function will correctly identify if the response is gzipped, as it will look for the presence of 'gzip' in the 'Content-Type' header, rather than comparing it with a specific value.
