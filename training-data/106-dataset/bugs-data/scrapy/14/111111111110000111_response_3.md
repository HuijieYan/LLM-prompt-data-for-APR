The test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` sets the Content-Type header to "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8" and expects the `is_gzipped` function to return True. However, the actual result is False, which causes the AssertionError.

The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is in the comparison of the Content-Type header value. The function only checks for an exact match with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip", without considering any additional parameters in the Content-Type header.

The bug occurs because the `is_gzipped` function does not account for cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like "charset=utf-8". As a result, the comparison fails and the function incorrectly returns False.

To fix the bug, the `is_gzipped` function should parse the Content-Type header and check for a partial match with "application/x-gzip". This will allow the function to correctly identify the gzip encoding even if additional parameters are present in the header.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip')
```

With this correction, the `is_gzipped` function will check for a partial match with "application/x-gzip" in the Content-Type header, allowing it to correctly identify gzipped responses even if additional parameters like "charset=utf-8" are present.
