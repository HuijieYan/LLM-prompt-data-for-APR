The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the content type 'application/x-gzip' with the response's 'Content-Type' header. The comparison doesn't take into account the presence of the charset in the header value, leading to the function returning False.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison in the function `is_gzipped` does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset.

To fix the bug, the comparison of content type should be modified to check if the header value starts with 'application/x-gzip' instead of checking for an exact match. This way, it will handle cases where the charset is also included in the header value.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip')
```
