The test case is checking if the `is_gzipped` function correctly identifies a response as gzipped based on the `Content-Type` header. The error message states that the assertion `self.assertTrue(is_gzipped(r1))` failed, implying that the `is_gzipped` function returned `False` when it was expected to return `True`.

The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the tuple `(b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Content-Type` header in the response includes the charset parameter (e.g., `charset=utf-8`), making it different from the hardcoded values in the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header starts with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, instead of direct comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
