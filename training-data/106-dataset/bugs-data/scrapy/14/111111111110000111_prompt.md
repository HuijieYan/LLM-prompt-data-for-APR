# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
utils.is_gzipped returns false on application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
I had a site return the following header, which caused SitemapSpider to not parse a sitemap xml that was gzipped.

Content-Type: application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8
Looking into the code it seems that the function utils.is_gzipped does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header would include charset.
```
