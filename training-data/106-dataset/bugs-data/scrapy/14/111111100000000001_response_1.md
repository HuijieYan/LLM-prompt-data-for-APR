The potential error in the provided code is that the function is only checking for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' content types, while there are other standard content types for gzipped files such as 'application/gzip-compressed', 'application/gzipped', etc. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check for these additional content types as well in order to accurately identify if the response is gzipped.

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip', b'application/gzip-compressed', b'application/gzipped'))
```
