The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function is in the comparison of the `ctype` variable with the expected content types. The `Content-Type` header in the response is a string, not bytes. This causes the comparison to fail, resulting in the function returning `False` instead of `True` as expected.

To fix this bug, we should convert the `ctype` variable to a string before comparing it with the expected content types. This can be done by decoding the bytes to a string using the `decode()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '').split(';')[0]
    return ctype in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
```

This code first retrieves the `Content-Type` header from the response. Then it splits the string at the semicolon and takes the first part, which represents the content type. Finally, it compares the content type with the expected values and returns the result.
