1. The test case sets the Content-Type header to "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8" and expects the is_gzipped function to return True. However, the test fails with an AssertionError because the function returns False instead.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the Content-Type header with the expected values for gzip content types.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the is_gzipped function only checks for the exact matches of 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header. It does not consider cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset, as in the test case provided.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
    - Modify the function to extract the primary content type from the Content-Type header and then check for the presence of 'gzip' in the extracted content type.
    - Use a library or built-in functionality to handle Content-Type parsing and extraction, ensuring that the function takes into account the presence of a charset in the header.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    if b'gzip' in ctype:  # Check if 'gzip' is present in the Content-Type header
        return True
    return False
```
