The potential error in the function `is_gzipped` lies in the comparison of the `ctype` variable with the tuple of gzipped content types. The `Content-Type` header can contain additional information, such as character encoding, after a semicolon. This leads to the mismatch between the expected value in the tuple and the actual value of `ctype`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to only check if the `Content-Type` starts with the specified gzipped content types.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(ct in ctype for ct in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the `Content-Type` header contains the specified gzipped content types, rather than performing an exact match. This will correctly identify gzipped content even if additional information follows the content type in the header.
