The buggy function `is_gzipped` is supposed to check if the response is gzipped based on the Content-Type header. However, it only checks for specific content types `application/x-gzip` and `application/gzip`, and does not account for any additional parameters or character encoding included in the Content-Type header.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the Content-Type header contains `gzip` anywhere in the value, regardless of any additional parameters or character encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
