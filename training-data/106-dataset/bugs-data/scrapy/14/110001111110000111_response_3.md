1. The test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` is trying to check if the function `is_gzipped` correctly identifies a gzip response with a charset. However, the test is failing because the function is returning False instead of True when the Content-Type header includes a charset.

2. The potential error location is in the comparison within the `is_gzipped` function.

3. The bug occurs because the comparison `ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')` does not account for different variations of the Content-Type header, such as including a charset.

4. To fix the bug, the function should check if the Content-Type header contains 'gzip', regardless of any additional text or charset.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify a gzip response with or without a charset in the Content-Type header.
