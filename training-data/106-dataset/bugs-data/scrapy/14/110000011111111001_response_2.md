The issue with the `is_gzipped` function is that it is checking for an exact match of the 'Content-Type' header with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' without considering the 'charset' parameter. In the provided test case, the 'Content-Type' header includes the charset parameter, 'charset=utf-8', which causes the function to return False.

To fix this issue, the function should check if 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' are in the 'Content-Type' header value, ignoring any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```

With this correction, the function will only compare the 'application' part of the Content-Type header value and ignore any additional parameters like 'charset'. This change will make the function return True for the provided test case.
