The test case "test_is_gzipped_with_charset" is failing with an AssertionError because it expects the response to be identified as gzipped, but the function "is_gzipped" is returning False instead of True.

The potential error location within the "is_gzipped" function is the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header with the values b'application/x-gzip' and b'application/gzip'. The comparison is not accounting for the presence of a charset within the 'Content-Type'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison is not considering the charset in the 'Content-Type', leading to a mismatch and the function returning False.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to also consider the charset when checking if the response is gzipped.

Here's the corrected code for the "is_gzipped" function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(ct in ctype for ct in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

By using the "any" function, we can check if any of the content types are present in the 'Content-Type' header, accounting for the charset if it exists.
