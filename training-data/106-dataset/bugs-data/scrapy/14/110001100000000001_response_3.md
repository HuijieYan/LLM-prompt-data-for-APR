Potential error location: The comparison of the content type in the "is_gzipped" function is not accurate.

Reason for the bug: The comparison of the content type in the function is incorrect. It is checking for "application/x-gzip" and "application/gzip", which are not the standard content types for gzip files.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the "Content-Encoding" header contains "gzip" instead of checking for the content type.

Corrected code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'')
    return content_encoding == b'gzip'
```
