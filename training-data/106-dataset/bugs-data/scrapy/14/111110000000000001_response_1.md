The potential error in this code is with the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header. The bug is that the comparison is being done with the values 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', which are not standard MIME types for gzip content.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the 'Content-Encoding' header is set to 'gzip'. This is the more standard way of determining if a response is gzipped.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', '')
    return encoding == 'gzip'
```
