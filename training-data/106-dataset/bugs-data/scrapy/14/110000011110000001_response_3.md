The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function is with the comparison of the content type (`ctype`) with the expected values. The function checks if the content type is either `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, but it does not account for the charset parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the content type in the test case includes a charset parameter, making the comparison fail and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to only check for the content type without considering any additional parameters such as charset.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly check if the content type contains either `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, regardless of any additional parameters such as charset.
