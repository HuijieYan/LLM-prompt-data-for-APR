The problem with the `is_gzipped` function is that it only checks for the exact content type 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'. However, the Content-Type header in the response includes the charset information as well, so the comparison fails.

To fix this, you can modify the function to check for a partial match of the content type, ignoring the charset information.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this correction, the function will check for a partial match of the content type, and it should work correctly for the provided test case.
