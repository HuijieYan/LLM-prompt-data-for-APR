Potential error location: The function `is_gzipped` does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes a charset.

Reasons behind the bug: The `is_gzipped` function only checks for 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header and does not consider additional parameters such as 'charset'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to parse the Content-Type header and extract the media type without any parameters like 'charset'.
2. Update the function to compare the extracted media type with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '').split(';')[0]  # Split and get only the media type
    return ctype in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
```
