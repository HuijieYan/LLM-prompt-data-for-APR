Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the comparison of the content type to check if it's gzipped.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the content type check is not comprehensive. The content type may be 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' but the function does not account for variations in the content type e.g. 'application/x-gzip; charset=utf-8'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' instead of an exact match.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
