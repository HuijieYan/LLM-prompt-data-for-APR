Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_14/scrapy/utils/gz.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')

```




# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
utils.is_gzipped returns false on application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
I had a site return the following header, which caused SitemapSpider to not parse a sitemap xml that was gzipped.

Content-Type: application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8
Looking into the code it seems that the function utils.is_gzipped does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header would include charset.
```
