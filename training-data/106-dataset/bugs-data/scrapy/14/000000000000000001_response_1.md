Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is in the comparison statement "return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')". This statement is not correctly checking if the Content-Type is gzipped.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison statement is checking if the entire Content-Type header matches either 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', instead of checking if 'gzip' is present in the Content-Type header.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison statement to check if 'gzip' is present in the Content-Type header. We can use the 'in' keyword to achieve this.

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
