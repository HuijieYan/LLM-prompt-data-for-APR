The error occurs because the "is_gzipped" function is not correctly handling the "Content-Type" header in the response. The function only checks for "application/x-gzip" and "application/gzip", but the test case includes a "Content-Type" with an additional charset parameter ("charset=utf-8"). 

The potential error location is in the "is_gzipped" function, specifically in the line where it checks for the content type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the additional parameters in the "Content-Type" header. One approach is to split the content type and charset and then check for the presence of "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip". 

Here's the corrected code for the "is_gzipped" function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_type = response.headers.get('Content-Type')
    if content_type:
        content_type = content_type.split(';')[0]  # remove parameters like charset
        return content_type in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the "Content-Type" header and check for "application/x-gzip" and "application/gzip" regardless of additional parameters like charset.
