The error occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for the "Content-Type" header value without considering any additional parameters such as the "charset" parameter. This causes the function to return False even when the "Content-Type" header includes "charset=utf-8".

To fix this issue, the `is_gzipped` function needs to be modified to check for the existence of "application/x-gzip" within the "Content-Type" header value, regardless of any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'application/x-gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify if the response is gzipped, regardless of any additional parameters in the "Content-Type" header.

Making this change will address the issue described in the GitHub bug report where the function `utils.is_gzipped` returned False for a response with "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8".
