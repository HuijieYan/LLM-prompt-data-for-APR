Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the "is_gzipped" function, specifically in the line "return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')". This line only checks for the exact content types 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', without considering any additional parameters in the Content-Type header.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function only checks for the exact content types 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', and does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'. As a result, the function returns False even when the response is actually gzipped.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to check for 'gzip' in the Content-Encoding header instead of relying solely on the Content-Type header.
2. Parse the Content-Type header to extract the actual content type and then check if it includes 'gzip'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'').lower()
    return b'gzip' in content_encoding
```
