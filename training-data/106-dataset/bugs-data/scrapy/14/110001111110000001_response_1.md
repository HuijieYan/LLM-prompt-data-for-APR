The test case "test_is_gzipped_with_charset" is trying to verify if the "is_gzipped" function correctly identifies a response with the Content-Type "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8" as gzipped. However, the test fails with the error message "AssertionError: False is not true".

The potential error in the "is_gzipped" function is the way it checks for the Content-Type. The function currently checks if the Content-Type header is exactly "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip", without considering any additional parameters like "charset=utf-8".

The bug occurs because the "Content-Type" header value in the response is "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8", which does not match exactly with the strings "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "is_gzipped" function to check if the Content-Type starts with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip" using the "startswith" method. This way, any additional parameters after a ';' will be ignored when checking for gzipped content.

Here's the corrected code for the "is_gzipped" function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this corrected function, the test case "test_is_gzipped_with_charset" should now pass without any assertion errors.
