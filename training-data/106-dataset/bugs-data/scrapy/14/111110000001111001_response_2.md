The potential error in the provided function is the comparison between the `ctype` variable and the tuple `(b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')`. The `ctype` variable is being compared with the entire tuple, which will always result in `False`. 

The reason for this bug is that the `ctype` variable contains the entire 'Content-Type' header value, including the character set information, such as `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'`. Therefore, the comparison with the tuple `(b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')` will never be true.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to check if `b'gzip'` is in the `ctype` variable. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the response is gzipped.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the function will correctly check if the 'gzip' string is present in the `Content-Type` header, and return `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.
