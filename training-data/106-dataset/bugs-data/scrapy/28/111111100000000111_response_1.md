Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line is trying to update the set `self.fingerprints` with the stripped lines from the file, but it does not read the file properly. 

Reason for the bug:
The file is not being read properly and the file pointer is not at the beginning of the file. It needs to be reset to the beginning of the file before reading the contents. 

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. Add `self.file.seek(0)` before attempting to read the contents of the file to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file.
2. Make sure to handle any potential file handling errors with proper error checking and handling.

Corrected code:
```python
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
