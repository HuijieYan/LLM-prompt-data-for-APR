The error occurs in the `RFPDupeFilter` class where the `request_seen()` method is not functioning as expected. This method checks if a given request has been seen before and returns `True` if it has, and `False` otherwise.

The bug occurs because the `request_seen()` method is not properly handling the file read operations and populating the `self.fingerprints` set with the data from the file.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `__init__` method to properly read the existing data from the file and populate the `self.fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            requests_seen_file = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(requests_seen_file):
                with open(requests_seen_file, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in file)

    # ... other methods ...

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        if self.file:
            self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False
```

In the `__init__` method, we check if the `requests.seen` file exists and read its contents into the `self.fingerprints` set. This ensures that the set is populated with existing data from the file.

Additionally, the `request_seen()` method has been modified to properly check for request fingerprints in the `self.fingerprints` set and update the set.

With these changes, the `RFPDupeFilter` class should function correctly and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
