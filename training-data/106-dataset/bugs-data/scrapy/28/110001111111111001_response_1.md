The error occurs in the `test_dupefilter_path` test case, specifically with the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` line. This assertion is failing, indicating that the `request_seen` method is not functioning as expected. 

Upon reviewing the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, it seems that the `open()` method is used to populate the `self.fingerprints` set with the contents of the `requests.seen` file. However, the `open()` method is not called explicitly in the `__init__` method, which leads to the `request_seen` method not functioning correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `open()` method is called in the `__init__` method to populate the `self.fingerprints` set with the contents of the `requests.seen` file. This will ensure that the `request_seen` method works correctly.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        self.open()  # Call the open method to populate the fingerprints set

    def open(self):
        if self.file:
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        self.file.close()

    # Other methods...
```

By adding the `self.open()` call at the end of the `__init__` method, we ensure that the `self.fingerprints` gets populated correctly, fixing the buggy behavior observed in the test case.
