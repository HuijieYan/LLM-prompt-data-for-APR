The problematic function is a Python class constructor (__init__) that initializes some instance variables. The bug appears to be in the 'path' parameter, where the code attempts to open a file without error checking. This could lead to potential issues if the path is invalid or if there are file permissions problems.

To fix the bug, we should add error checking for file opening and handle exceptions if they occur.

Here's the corrected function with added error checking:

```python
import os
import logging

class ExampleClass:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Failed to open {path}: {e}")
                self.file = None
```
