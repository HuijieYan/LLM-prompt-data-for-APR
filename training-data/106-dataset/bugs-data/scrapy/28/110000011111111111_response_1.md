The issue in the `__init__` method is that it is not handling the case where the file at the given path already contains data. When this happens, it is supposed to update the `self.fingerprints` set with the data from the file. However, in the provided code, it is not handling this case which causes the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` to fail in the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__init__` method to read the data from the file and update the set `self.fingerprints` if the file contains data.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.strip() for x in file.readlines())
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

With this fix, the `__init__` method will read the data from the file if it exists and update the `self.fingerprints` set accordingly. This will address the issue in the test case and the assertion `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` should pass.
