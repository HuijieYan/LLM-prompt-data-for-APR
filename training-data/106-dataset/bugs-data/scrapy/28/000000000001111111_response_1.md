The potential error in the code is that the function is missing the `logging` module and `os` module, which are being used in the function.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to use the logging and os modules without importing them. This results in a "NameError" as the code is not able to find the "logging" and "os" modules.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `logging` module and `os` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import logging
import os

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
This will ensure that the `logging` and `os` modules are available for use within the function.
