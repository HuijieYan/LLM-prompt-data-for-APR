The problem in the given code lies within the __init__ method of the RFPDupeFilter class. The issue is that the method attempts to open and read from the file provided in the 'path' argument, but it does not handle the file pointer correctly.

The reason for the bug is that when the file is opened, the file pointer is left at the end of the file, so when attempting to read from it using self.file, it does not read any content.

To fix the bug, the file pointer should be reset to the beginning of the file after opening it. This can be achieved using the seek(0) method on the file object.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = path
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

# Rest of the class implementation...
```

With this modification, the file pointer is reset to the beginning of the file after opening it, which allows the fingerprints to be read correctly from the file. This should resolve the bug and make the test_dupefilter_path test function pass.
