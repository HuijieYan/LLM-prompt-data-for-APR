Potential error location: The potential error in the given code is that the `open` function is used to open a file, but it's not being closed properly, which can lead to resource leaks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `open` function opens the file, but the file is not closed after its use, which can lead to resource leaks and may cause issues if the file is being modified by other processes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `with` statement to ensure the file is properly closed after its use.
2. Catch any potential exceptions when working with the file.
3. Use appropriate error handling to manage potential issues related to file operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# corrected function
import logging
import os

class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            try:
                with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                    self.file = file
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            except IOError as e:
                print("An error occurred while processing the file:", e)
