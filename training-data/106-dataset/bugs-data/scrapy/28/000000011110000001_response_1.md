The error seems to be related to the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. The error message indicates that the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` failed, meaning that the `request_seen` method did not behave as expected.

The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. This line reads the contents of the file and updates the `fingerprints` set, but there is a missing check to handle the case when the file is empty or doesn't exist.

The error occurs because the file is empty or doesn't exist, so the `self.fingerprints` set is not being updated with any values.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the file is empty or doesn't exist. We can do this by checking if the file exists and is not empty before updating `self.fingerprints`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            filename = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(filename) and os.path.getsize(filename) > 0:
                self.file = open(filename, 'a+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            # else:
            #   self.file = open(filename, 'a+')
            #   self.fingerprints = set()

    # Rest of the class methods...
```

With this fix, we check if the file exists and is not empty before updating `self.fingerprints`. If the file is empty or doesn't exist, we don't update `self.fingerprints` and leave it as an empty set. This should resolve the issue with the `request_seen` method.
