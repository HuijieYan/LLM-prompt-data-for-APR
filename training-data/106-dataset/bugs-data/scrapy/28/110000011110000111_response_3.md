The potential error location in the `__init__` function is with the `open` method call. The bug is likely occurring because the `open` method is missing from the provided code, and it is being called in the test function (`test_dupefilter_path`).

To fix the bug, the `open` method needs to be added to the `__init__` function.

Corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def open(self):
        if self.file:
            self.file = open(self.file.name, 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.clear()
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        return request.url in self.fingerprints
```

This corrected code includes the `open` and `close` methods, addressing the issue with the original `__init__` function not having an `open` method.
