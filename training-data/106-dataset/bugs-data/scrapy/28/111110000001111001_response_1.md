Potential error:

The buggy function uses the 'a+' mode to open a file, which means the file is opened for reading and appending, but the file pointer is initially positioned at the end of the file. When the file is being read to update the fingerprints, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, so no data is read from the file.

Reason for the bug:

The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file when it's being read, so no data is read from the file to update the fingerprints.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, you can set the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading from it to update the fingerprints.

Corrected code:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                file.seek(0)  # Set the file pointer to the beginning of the file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
```
