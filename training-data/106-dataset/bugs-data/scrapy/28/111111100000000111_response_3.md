Potential Error Location: The potential error location is in the `__init__` method where the code tries to open a file and update the `self.fingerprints` set with the content of the file.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the file is opened for appending ('a+'), but the file pointer is not reset to the beginning of the file before reading its content. As a result, the content of the file is not read correctly into the `self.fingerprints` set.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `seek(0)` method to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file before reading its content.
2. Check if the file is not empty before updating the `self.fingerprints` set to avoid adding an empty string to the set.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        if self.file.tell() != 0:
            self.file.seek(0)
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
    ```
