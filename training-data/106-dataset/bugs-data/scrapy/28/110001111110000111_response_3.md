This is a constructor for a class, not a function, and it seems to be a part of a larger codebase related to web scraping using Scrapy.

The error message suggests that the `df2.request_seen(r1)` assertion is failing, indicating that the `request_seen` method is not functioning as expected.

It seems that the issue is with the `open()` method that is not properly initializing the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `open()` method to properly initialize the `self.file` from the given path and set the `self.fingerprints` from the content of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.open(path)

    def open(self, path):
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)

    def close(self, message):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
            self.file = None

    def request_seen(self, request):
        # Implementation of request_seen method
        pass
```

In this corrected code, the `open()` method properly initializes the `self.file` and `self.fingerprints` attributes using the given path. Additionally, I've included a placeholder for the `request_seen` method that would need to be implemented for the specific requirements of the class.
