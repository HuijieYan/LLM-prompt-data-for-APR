The error occurs when the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` statement fails in the `test_dupefilter_path` test case. This indicates that the `request_seen` method is not functioning as expected, likely due to issues with the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The potential error location is in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, specifically in the block where the file is opened and its contents are read into the `fingerprints` set. It seems that the file is not being closed properly after reading its contents.

The bug occurs because, when the file is opened using `open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')`, the file pointer is at the end of the file. So when `self.fingerprints` is updated using `x.rstrip() for x in self.file`, it does not read anything because the file pointer is at the end.

To fix the bug, we need to close the file after reading its contents correctly. Also, it's important to handle the case when the file does not exist.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
                file.close()
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

In the corrected code, the file is opened using a `with` statement, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its contents are read. Additionally, before reading the file contents, it checks if the file exists to handle the case when the file is not present.
