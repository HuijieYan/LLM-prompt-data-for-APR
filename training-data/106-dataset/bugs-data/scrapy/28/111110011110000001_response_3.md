The test case `test_dupefilter_path` is trying to test the functionality of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. It creates two requests `r1` and `r2`, then creates a temporary directory `path` and initializes an instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with `path` as the argument. The test then checks if the requests are seen or not, opens and closes the filter, and performs similar operations with another instance of `RFPDupeFilter`.

The error occurs when the test case tries to assert that `df2.request_seen(r1)` should return `True`, but it actually returns `False`, leading to an `AssertionError`.

The potential error location is the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class, which is not provided in the given code block.

The bug likely occurs because when initializing the instance of `RFPDupeFilter` with `path`, the constructor does not populate the `self.fingerprints` set with the existing fingerprints from the file specified by `path`.

To fix this issue, a method needs to be added to the `RFPDupeFilter` class to read fingerprints from the file and populate the `self.fingerprints` set.

Here's the corrected code for the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            self._read_seeds()
    
    def _read_seeds(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.path):
            with open(self.path, 'r') as f:
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in f)

    def open(self):
        self.file = open(self.path, 'a+')

    def close(self, reason):
        self.file.close()

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request_fingerprint(request)
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + '\n')
        return False
```

With this change, the `RFPDupeFilter` class now has the `_read_seeds` method to read existing fingerprints from the file specified by `path` and populate the `self.fingerprints` set with the existing fingerprints. This should fix the bug encountered in the test case.
