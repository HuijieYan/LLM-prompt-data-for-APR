The bug in the code is that the function `__init__` might not be properly handling the file path when it is not given. 

The error message that might occur is related to a missing file path. For example, if the `path` variable is not provided, then the following line of code would result in an error:
```python
self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
```

The bug occurs because the code fails to check whether the `path` is provided or not, leading to an error when trying to open a file with a `None` path.

To fix this issue, a simple if condition can be added to check if the `path` is provided or not. If it is not provided, then a default path can be used. 

The corrected code for the `__init__` function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
    else:
        default_path = '/default/path'  # Provide a default path here
        self.file = open(os.path.join(default_path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
```
In this corrected code, an if-else block has been added to handle the case when the `path` is not provided. If the `path` is not provided, a default path is used to open the file. This prevents the function from throwing an error when the `path` is not provided.
