The issue seems to be with the initialization of the 'self.file' variable. It is being opened in 'a+' mode, which means it is opened for reading and appending. However, it is not first being truncated, so any existing data will not be overwritten. 

To fix this bug, we should set the file pointer to the beginning of the file to override any existing data and hence ensures the unseen requests won't be duplicated, we can achieve this by adding `self.file.seek(0)` right after opening the file. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the start of the file
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
