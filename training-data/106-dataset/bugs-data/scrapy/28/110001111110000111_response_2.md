The error is occurring in the `test_dupefilter_path` function due to the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` statement failing, which means the `request_seen` method is not working as expected.

The potential error in the problematic function lies in the `__init__` method. The issue is with the `self.fingerprints` set being initialized outside of the `if path` condition. This causes the set to be initialized even when `path` is not provided, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `self.fingerprints` set should only be initialized if the `path` is provided. Additionally, the `file` object should be closed after its usage to release system resources.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import os
import logging

class DupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints = set(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
        else:
            self.fingerprints = set()

    def close(self):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `self.fingerprints` set is initialized only when `path` is provided. The `close` method is also added to properly close the file object when it's no longer needed.

This should resolve the bug and allow the `test_dupefilter_path` function to run without errors.
