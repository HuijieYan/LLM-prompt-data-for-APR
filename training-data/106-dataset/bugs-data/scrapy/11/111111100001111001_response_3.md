The provided buggy function `gunzip` is attempting to gunzip the given data while being resilient to CRC checksum errors. However, an error might occur in the `while` loop where the chunk of data is being read and appended to the `output` array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `while` loop, specifically around the statement `output += chunk`. The error might be occurring due to the way the `chunk` is being read and appended to the `output` array.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the loop is not properly handling the reading of data chunks and appending them to the `output`. Additionally, the handling of potential errors, such as IOError, EOFError, and struct.error, may not be fully implemented, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `while` loop should be modified to properly handle the reading of data chunks and appending them to the `output`. Additionally, the error handling for potential exceptions should be more comprehensive and robust.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO
import struct

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = bytearray()
    try:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output.extend(chunk)
    except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
        if f.extrabuf or output:
            try:
                output += f.extrabuf
            finally:
                pass
        else:
            raise
    return bytes(output)
```

In the corrected code, the `while` loop has been modified to properly read data chunks and append them to the `output` array. Additionally, the error handling for potential exceptions has been updated to ensure comprehensive and robust handling.
