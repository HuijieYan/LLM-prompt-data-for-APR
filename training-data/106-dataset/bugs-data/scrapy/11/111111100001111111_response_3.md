The issue seems to be related to the `gunzip` function, which is responsible for unzipping the given data. The function seems to be reading the gzip data in chunks and then concatenating the chunks together. 

One potential bug is that the loop within the function doesn't seem to be handling the EOFError or struct.error properly, which can result in duplicate data being returned.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `gunzip` function to properly handle the EOFError and struct.error exceptions, and to properly concatenate the chunks of data.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = b''
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
        return output
```

In this corrected code, we have used the `gzip.GzipFile` class to create a gzip file object and then read the chunks of data using the `read` method. We properly handle the end of the file by breaking out of the loop when the chunk is empty. This should prevent the duplicate data issue and properly handle the gzip data.
