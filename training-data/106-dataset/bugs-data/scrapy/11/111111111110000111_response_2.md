The error message indicates that the file '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_11/tests/sample_data/compressed/unexpected-eof.gz' is not found. This suggests that the file path is incorrect or the file is missing, which is causing the error in the test function.

The potential error location within the 'gunzip' function is in the following line:
```python
with open(join(SAMPLEDIR, 'unexpected-eof.gz'), 'rb') as f:
```
Here, the 'join' function is used to create the file path by joining the 'SAMPLEDIR' with the file name 'unexpected-eof.gz'. This implies that the variable 'SAMPLEDIR' should contain the directory path where the file is located. If this variable is not correctly defined or the file is not present in the specified directory, the 'FileNotFoundError' will occur.

The bug is occurring due to the incorrect file path being used in the test function, which leads to the file not being found, and the subsequent error.

To fix this bug, possible approaches include:
1. Defining the 'SAMPLEDIR' variable correctly with the actual directory path where the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is located.
2. Ensuring that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is present in the specified directory.

Here's the corrected 'gunzip' function and the test function with the fixed file path:

```python
# Corrected gunzip function
def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Using f.read directly instead of custom read1 function
            output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

```python
# Corrected test function
def test_gunzip_illegal_eof(self):
    with open('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_11/tests/sample_data/compressed/unexpected-eof.gz', 'rb') as f:
        text = html_to_unicode('charset=cp1252', gunzip(f.read()))[1]
        with open('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_11/tests/sample_data/compressed/unexpected-eof-output.txt', 'rb') as o:
            expected_text = o.read().decode("utf-8")
            self.assertEqual(len(text), len(expected_text))
            self.assertEqual(text, expected_text)
```

By correcting the file path in the test function and ensuring that the file is present in the specified directory, the 'FileNotFoundError' issue should be resolved.
