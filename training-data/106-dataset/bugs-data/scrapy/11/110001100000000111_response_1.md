Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the `gunzip` function which is responsible for unzipping the response content and returning it. The current implementation of the function may be causing the response.body to become duplicate.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `gunzip` function doesn't handle the extraction of the gzipped data correctly, which results in duplicate content. This could be due to an issue with how the GzipFile is being used to extract the data.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the GzipFile is properly instantiated and used for extracting the gzipped data.
2. Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the extraction process to prevent duplicate content.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import zlib
import binascii

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.
    
    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    try:
        decompressed = zlib.decompress(data, 15 + 16)
        return decompressed
    except zlib.error:
        try:
            return zlib.decompress(data, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        except zlib.error as e:
            if 'Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check' in str(e):
                return zlib.decompress(binascii.unhexlify(b'1f8b0800000000000003') + data, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
            raise
```
This corrected code uses the `zlib` library to properly decompress the gzipped data, handling any potential errors or issues that may occur during the decompression process. This should prevent the issue of duplicate content when extracting the gzipped data.
