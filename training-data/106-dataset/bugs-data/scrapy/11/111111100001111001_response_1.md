The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is the usage of the `read1` function. The `read1` function is not defined in the provided code, it seems to be a placeholder for the actual read function that needs to be used to read data from the GzipFile object.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `read1` function is not correctly implemented and is not handling the file read properly.

To fix the bug, the `gunzip` function should use the `read` function of the GzipFile object to read data from it, instead of using a non-existent `read1` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8196)
        if not chunk:
            break
        output += chunk
    return output
```
