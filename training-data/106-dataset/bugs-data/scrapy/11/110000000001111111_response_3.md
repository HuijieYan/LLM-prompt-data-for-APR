Potential Error Location:
The issue may be with the while loop inside the gunzip function, where it reads chunks of data from the GzipFile and appends it to the output variable.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of the data chunks read from the GzipFile. The handling of extrabuf and the loop termination logic could be causing the duplicate content issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the extrabuf data is handled correctly and not duplicated in the output.
2. Modify the while loop termination logic to ensure it breaks when all data is read, without duplicating content.

Corrected Function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8196)
        if not chunk:
            break
        output += chunk
    
    return output
```
