The error message provided is a `FileNotFoundError` indicating that the file `unexpected-eof.gz` is not found. This error message is unrelated to the function `gunzip`. The issue is with the location of the sample file that the test function is trying to find.

The problematic function `gunzip` is meant to gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible, handling CRC checksum errors. The issue in the function occurs within the `while` loop, particularly with the `chunk` variable. There is inconsistency with the looping condition and the handling of the `chunk` variable.

The function approaches the end of the file read incorrectly, leading to incomplete or missing data in the output. This results from the improper conditions set for the while loop, incomplete error handling, and the approach to buffering and concatenating the output data.

To fix the issue, the loop condition, error handling, and the method of concatenating the output data need to be restructured. The proper approach would be to use a more pythonic way of looping through the gzip file and read the data until the end.

Here's the corrected `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    input_data = BytesIO(data)
    gzipfile = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=input_data)
    output = gzipfile.read()
    return output
```

In this corrected code, the `gzip` module's `GzipFile` class is used, and the `read()` method reads the complete decompressed data from the file. This ensures that all data is properly decompressed and returned.
