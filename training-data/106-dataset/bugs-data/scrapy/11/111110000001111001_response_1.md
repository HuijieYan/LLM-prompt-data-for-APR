Potential Error Location: The error is likely to be occurring within the while loop where the data is being read and concatenated.

Reason for Bug: The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of the data extraction from the gzip file.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `GzipFile` module to read the gzip data and extract it properly.
2. Check for any errors during the data extraction and handle them appropriately.
3. Ensure that the data extraction is done in a loop until all the data is extracted.

Corrected Code:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
    
    return output
```
