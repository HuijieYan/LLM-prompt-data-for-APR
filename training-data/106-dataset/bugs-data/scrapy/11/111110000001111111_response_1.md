Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the while loop where the data is read in chunks and appended to the output.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the gzip data, which leads to duplicate content.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the zlib module to handle the gzip data and properly decompress it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import zlib

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    output = zlib.decompress(data, 16+zlib.MAX_WBITS)
    return output
```
