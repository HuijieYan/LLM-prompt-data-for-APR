Potential Error Location:
The issue could be in the "gunzip(data)" function, specifically in the while loop that reads the gzip file and appends the chunk to the output.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect handling of the chunk data or the extrabuf in case of errors such as IOError, EOFError, or struct.error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different way to handle errors and exceptions when reading the gzip file.
2. Ensure that the output is not duplicated and that the extrabuf is handled properly in case of errors.

Corrected Code:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO
import struct

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        return f.read()
```
