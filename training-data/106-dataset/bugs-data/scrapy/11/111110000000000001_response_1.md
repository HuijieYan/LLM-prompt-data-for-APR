Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the while loop where the data is being read from the GzipFile.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The function is not handling the IOError, EOFError, and struct.error exceptions properly, leading to incomplete or incorrect extraction of data from the GzipFile.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a try-except block to properly handle the exceptions that may occur during the extraction process.
2. Ensure that the output is properly concatenated with the data read from the GzipFile.
3. Handle cases where the output is empty and f.extrabuf contains the data.

Corrected Code:
```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    try:
        while chunk:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
    except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
        if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
            try:
                output += f.extrabuf
            finally:
                break
        else:
            raise
    return output
```
