The buggy function `gunzip` is intended to gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible. However, based on the provided test case and the associated issue description, it seems that the function is returning duplicate or incorrect data, causing issues with text content retrieval.

The potential error location within the function is the while loop that reads and concatenates chunks of data from the GzipFile. It seems that the loop may be reading and appending data incorrectly, leading to duplicate or incorrect output.

It is possible that the issue is related to how the GzipFile is being read and how the output data is being concatenated.

To fix the bug:
1. We should ensure that data is read from the GzipFile in a correct and non-duplicative manner.
2. Handle any possible errors related to data extraction from the GzipFile.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()  # Read the entire decompressed data from the GzipFile
    return output
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `gzip.GzipFile` to read the decompressed data from the input data.
2. We directly use the `f.read()` method to read the entire decompressed data from the GzipFile, which ensures that no duplicate or incorrect data is returned.
3. We ensure proper handling of the GzipFile by using a context manager (`with` statement).

By making these changes, the function should now correctly gunzip the input data and return the expected output without any duplicates.
