Potential Error Location:
The issue might be with the `gunzip` function, specifically with the handling of the GzipFile and reading chunks of data. The function seems to be duplicating the response content, and it is not handling the GzipFile and data chunks properly, leading to duplicated output.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `gunzip` function initializes a GzipFile and attempts to read and concatenate chunks of data, but it does not handle the data properly in case of errors. This leads to duplicated output and potentially incorrect behavior when dealing with the GzipFile object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle exceptions and errors in the `gunzip` function related to reading and concatenating chunks of data.
2. Verify the content of the GzipFile and ensure that the data is properly extracted without duplication.

Corrected Code:
```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')  # Added mode='rb'
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Changed read1 to read
            output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```
In the corrected code:
1. The `GzipFile` object is properly initialized with the `mode='rb'` parameter.
2. The `read1` function is changed to `f.read` to read chunks of data from the `GzipFile`.
3. Exception handling is modified to properly handle errors and ensure that the output is not duplicated.
