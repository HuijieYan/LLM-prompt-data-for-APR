# Corrected function

```python
import struct
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')
    output = b''
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:  # Stop loop if no more data to read
                break
            output += chunk
        except (EOFError, struct.error):
            # If the exception is an EOFError or struct.error, break the loop
            break
    return output

```

The changes made to the `gunzip` function:
1. Changed the `read1` function calls to `f.read` with a specified size.
2. Removed the unnecessary `chunk` variable initialization and assignment inside the loop.
3. Handled the exceptions `EOFError` and `struct.error` by breaking out of the loop, as these are the specific exceptions raised by CRC checksum errors.
4. Specified `mode='rb'` when creating the `GzipFile` object to ensure binary mode is used.
