The potential error in the given code lies in the `gunzip` function, particularly in the while loop. The loop reads chunks of data from the GzipFile object and concatenates them to the `output` variable. This process continues until an exception occurs or the read chunk is empty.

The issue with the current code is that it fails to handle the CRC checksum errors properly. When an error occurs (IOError, EOFError, struct.error), it attempts to add any remaining `f.extrabuf` to the output, but the break statement is not indented correctly, which results in the loop not breaking properly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this issue, the break statement should be indented properly to break out of the loop when an error occurs and the output has some value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import struct
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

In the corrected code, the break statement is now properly indented within the if-else block, ensuring that it breaks out of the loop when an error occurs and the output contains some value. This addresses the issue and makes the function more resilient to CRC checksum errors.
