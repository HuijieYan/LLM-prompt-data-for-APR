The test case 'test_gunzip_illegal_eof' is trying to open a file called 'unexpected-eof.gz', but it is not found in the specified directory. This is causing a FileNotFoundError.

The potential error location within the 'gunzip' function could be the line where the input file is being read. If the file is not found or cannot be read, it could result in the function failing to execute properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is trying to read a file that does not exist at the specified location.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file being opened in the test function actually exists in the specified directory. Additionally, we should modify the 'gunzip' function to handle cases where the input file is not found or cannot be read.

Here's the corrected code for the 'gunzip' function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    try:
        f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
        return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found")
        return None
```

This corrected code handles the case where the input file is not found by catching the FileNotFoundError and returning None. This will prevent the function from failing when the input file is not found.
