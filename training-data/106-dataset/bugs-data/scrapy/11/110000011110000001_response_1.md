The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' cannot be found, which is being used in the test function `test_gunzip_illegal_eof`. This means that the test file is not located in the specified directory.

The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is in the line `with open(join(SAMPLEDIR, 'unexpected-eof.gz'), 'rb') as f:`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not located in the directory specified by `SAMPLEDIR`.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the file path to point to the correct location of the 'unexpected-eof.gz' file.
2. Ensure that the 'unexpected-eof.gz' file exists in the specified location.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `gunzip`:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO
from os.path import join

def gunzip(data, filepath):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(filename=filepath, mode='rb', fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8196)
        if not chunk:
            break
        output += chunk
    f.close()
    return output

def test_gunzip_illegal_eof(self):
    filepath = join(SAMPLEDIR, 'unexpected-eof.gz')  # Update the file path
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
        text = html_to_unicode('charset=cp1252', gunzip(f.read(), filepath))[1]
        with open(join(SAMPLEDIR, 'unexpected-eof-output.txt'), 'rb') as o:
            expected_text = o.read().decode("utf-8")
            self.assertEqual(len(text), len(expected_text))
            self.assertEqual(text, expected_text)
```
