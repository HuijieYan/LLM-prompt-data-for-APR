Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the while loop, specifically in the try-except block where the read1() function is called.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the read1() function is not defined within the gunzip() function, causing a NameError. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the read1() function is called without the necessary library import.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the read1() function from the necessary library (e.g., io module) to resolve the NameError.
2. Use a try-except block to catch any potential errors related to the read1() function or the gzip module.

Corrected Code:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error, NameError):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```
