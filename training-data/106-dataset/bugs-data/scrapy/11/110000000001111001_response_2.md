Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the try-except block where the function is attempting to read from the Gzip file and append the chunk to the output.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `read1` method, which should be a method of the GzipFile object being used to read the data. It seems that `read1` should be replaced with the `read` method of the GzipFile object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the `read1` method with the `read` method of the GzipFile object, as `read1` is not a standard method.
2. Use a more specific exception handling to capture any potential errors more accurately.

Corrected Code:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Replace read1 with read
            output += chunk
        except (EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```
