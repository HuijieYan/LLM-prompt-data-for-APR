The potential error location within the problematic function is in the while loop that attempts to read chunks of data from a GzipFile.

The bug in this code is that it doesn't properly handle the end of the compressed data. The while loop continues reading chunks even after reaching the end of the compressed data, which may cause errors due to attempting to read past the end of the input data.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the while loop to properly handle the end of the compressed data and exit the loop when all the data has been read.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    output = b''
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        try:
            while True:
                chunk = f.read(8196)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output

```
