The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' cannot be found, which is preventing the test function from running properly.

The potential error location within the function is the invocation of the 'gunzip' function with the file content as an argument. It seems that the 'gunzip' function is expected to handle a file, but it currently takes raw data as input.

The reason for the bug is that the 'gunzip' function is not designed to handle file input, rather it expects raw data as input. This mismatch in input type is causing the error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the 'gunzip' function should be modified to accept a file as input and then read the content of the file within the function. This change will align the input type with the expectation and fix the error in the test function.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip_file(file_path):
    """Gunzip the given file and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
        output = b''
        chunk = b'.'
        while chunk:
            try:
                chunk = f.read1(8196)
                output += chunk
            except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
                # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
                # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
                # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
                # contains the whole page content
                if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                    try:
                        output += f.extrabuf
                    finally:
                        break
                else:
                    raise
    return output
```

This function now accepts a file path as input, reads the content of the file, and then performs the gunzip operation. This aligns with the input requirement of the test function and should resolve the error.
