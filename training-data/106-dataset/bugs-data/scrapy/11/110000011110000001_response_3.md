1. The test case 'test_gunzip_illegal_eof' is trying to open a file 'unexpected-eof.gz' which cannot be found, leading to a FileNotFoundError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'gunzip' function, specifically the part where it tries to open the file 'unexpected-eof.gz'.

3. The bug occurred because the gunzip function is trying to open a file within the function itself, which is not the intended behavior. The function should be decompressing the data passed to it, not trying to open a file.

4. To fix the bug, the gunzip function needs to be modified to decompress the data input instead of trying to open a file. It should take the input data, decompress it, and return the decompressed output.

5. Here's the corrected code for the gunzip function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
    return output
```
