The error in the function seems to be related to the loop that handles reading chunks of data from the GzipFile object f and appending them to the output. However, the loop seems to be designed in a way that makes it prone to returning prematurely or not handling errors correctly. The use of read1 function is also unclear as it is not defined in the code.

To fix this bug, we can refactor the loop to use the read method of the GzipFile object and handle exceptions more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')
    output = b''
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output:
                output += f.extrabuf
            break
    f.close()
    return output
```

In this corrected code, we use the read method of the GzipFile object to read chunks of data, and we handle exceptions by adding any remaining data from the GzipFile object to the output and then breaking out of the loop.

Additionally, we properly close the GzipFile object before returning the result.
