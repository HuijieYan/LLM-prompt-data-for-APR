Potential Error Location:
The error occurs because the test case is trying to open a file 'unexpected-eof.gz' which does not exist in the specified directory.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug in the gunzip function is not directly related to the FileNotFoundError. The function is supposed to gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible, but it has some issues with exception handling and output concatenation.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a try-except block to handle the FileNotFoundError in the test function by providing a proper file path or creating the file if needed.
2. Update the gunzip function to handle exceptions more effectively and concatenate the output data properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = bytearray()
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                output += f.extrabuf
                break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

This corrected function now appropriately handles exceptions, reads the gzip data, and concatenates the output. It should resolve the issues with the gunzip function and allow the test case to run without encountering a FileNotFoundError.
