The bug seems to be related to the `gunzip` function in the provided code, which is supposed to gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible while being resilient to CRC checksum errors. The bug could be causing the response body to be duplicate in certain cases.

The potential error location within the `gunzip` function could be the while loop where the data chunks are being concatenated and errors are being handled. It is likely that the chunk concatenation and error handling logic is not working correctly, leading to duplicate output or incorrect handling of certain cases.

The bug could be occurring due to incorrect handling of the data chunks or errors within the while loop. It's possible that the error handling logic is not properly breaking out of the loop in some cases, leading to duplicate or incorrect output.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to rework the error handling logic within the while loop to ensure that the loop breaks out correctly when errors occur and to handle the concatenation of data chunks more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if chunk:
                output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError):
            break
    return output
```

In the corrected code, the error handling and chunk concatenation logic within the while loop has been simplified and reworked to ensure that the loop breaks out correctly when errors occur and to handle the concatenation of data chunks accurately. This should resolve the issue related to duplicate response body.
