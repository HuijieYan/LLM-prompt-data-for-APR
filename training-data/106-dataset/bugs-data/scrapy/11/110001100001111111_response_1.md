The bug seems to be occurring in the `gunzip` function, where the GzipFile object `f` is used to read chunks of data. The issue may be related to how the chunks of data are concatenated in the `output` variable, resulting in duplicate content or incorrect output. 

The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is in the while loop where the chunks of data are being read and concatenated. It seems that the logic for handling the completion of the data may not be correct, resulting in duplicate or incomplete content.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to how the data is being read and concatenated in the while loop. If the data is being read and concatenated inappropriately, it could result in duplicate or incomplete content.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to revise the while loop logic to ensure that the data is read and concatenated correctly, and also handle the completion of the data appropriately. Additionally, handling any exceptions that may occur during the data reading process could also be necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import struct
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    try:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
    except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
        if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
            output += f.extrabuf
    return output
```

In the corrected code, the while loop logic has been revised to read chunks of data using `f.read()` and concatenate them to the `output` variable. The try-except block handles any exceptions that may occur during the data reading process and ensures that the completion of the data is handled appropriately. This should help in resolving the issue of duplicate or incomplete content.
