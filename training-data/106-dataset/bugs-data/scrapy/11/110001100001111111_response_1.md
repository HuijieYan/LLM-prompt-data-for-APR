The problem with the `gunzip` function is that it is not properly handling the output data from the `GzipFile` object. It seems to be attempting to read the data from the `GzipFile` object using a `read1` function that is not defined in the provided code.

To fix this bug, the function should directly read the data from the `GzipFile` object and handle any potential errors. The corrected code for the `gunzip` function is as follows:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # handle errors
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                    break
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

In this corrected code, the `GzipFile` object is used to directly read chunks of data, handle any potential errors, and concatenate the chunks into the `output`. This should address the issue with duplicate response content in Scrapy's `response.body`.
