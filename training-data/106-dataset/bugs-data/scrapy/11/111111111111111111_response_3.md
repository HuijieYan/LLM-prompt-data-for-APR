The error message indicates a "FileNotFoundError" when the test function tries to open a file named 'unexpected-eof.gz'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "gunzip" function as it tries to process the gzip file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "gunzip" function is trying to read a file that does not exist, and therefore it raises a "FileNotFoundError".

To fix the bug, the "gunzip" function should not directly handle file operations. Instead, it should receive the gzip data as a parameter and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the "gunzip" function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        return f.read()
```

By making the "gunzip" function to only operate on the provided data, we can eliminate the need for file operations and avoid the "FileNotFoundError" issue.
