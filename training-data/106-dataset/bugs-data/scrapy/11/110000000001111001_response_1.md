There are a few issues with the provided function `gunzip`. 

1. The `read1` function is not defined.
2. The logic within the while loop is not correctly structured and can lead to potential errors in handling the gzip data.

To fix the issues, the following corrections need to be made:
1. Define the `read1` function or replace it with the `read` method of the `GzipFile` object.
2. Restructure the while loop to properly handle the gzip decompression and error handling.

Given these corrections, the corrected `gunzip` function is as follows:

```python
def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8196)
        if not chunk:
            break
        output += chunk

    return output
```

In the corrected function:
1. The `read1` function has been replaced with the `read` method of the `GzipFile` object to read chunks of data during decompression.
2. The while loop simplifies the logic for reading chunks of data and appending them to the output.

These changes address both the error in the original function and distortions in the logic, providing a robust and effective `gunzip` function.
