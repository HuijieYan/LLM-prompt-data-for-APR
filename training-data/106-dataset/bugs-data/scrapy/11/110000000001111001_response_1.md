Potential error location:
The potential error location is the while loop and the try-except block inside the gunzip function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The while loop does not have a condition to check for the end of the gzip data stream. Additionally, the read1 function is not defined and should be replaced with f.read() to read from the gzip file object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to the while loop to check for the end of the gzip data stream.
2. Replace the read1 function with f.read() to read from the gzip file object.
3. Remove the extrabuf attribute, as it is not needed to reconstruct the gzip data.

Corrected code:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            raise
    return output
```
