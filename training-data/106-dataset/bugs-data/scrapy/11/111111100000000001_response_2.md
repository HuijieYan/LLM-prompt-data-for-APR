The error in the provided function is likely to occur in the `while` loop where the `try` block attempts to read from the `GzipFile` object `f`. The loop continues as long as `chunk` is not empty, but the extraction of data from the `GzipFile` object might be causing the issue.

The potential reasons for the bug include:
- Overcomplicated error handling
- Inadequate error messages and information
- Potential issues related to the incomplete extraction of data from the `GzipFile` object

To fix the bug, the error handling approach can be simplified and the data extraction method can be revised to ensure that all data is properly extracted from the `GzipFile` object.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    output = b''
    try:
        with GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
            output = f.read()
    except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
        # Handle any exceptions related to reading the gzip data
        pass
    return output
```
