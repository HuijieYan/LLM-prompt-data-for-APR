Potential error location: The while loop in the gunzip function is not properly handling the chunk reading and concatenation, which can result in incorrectly concatenated output data.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The while loop does not properly handle the end of the file condition, leading to potential errors when attempting to read beyond the end of the input data.
2. The try-except block is catching too many exceptions, making it difficult to differentiate between different error conditions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more reliable method for reading chunks of data from the GzipFile object, ensuring that the end of the file is properly handled.
2. Refactor the try-except block to only catch specific exceptions that are relevant to CRC checksum errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:  # Open the GzipFile in read mode
        output = b''
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Read a chunk from the GzipFile
            if not chunk:  # Check if the chunk is empty, indicating end of file
                break
            output += chunk  # Concatenate the chunk to the output
    return output
```
