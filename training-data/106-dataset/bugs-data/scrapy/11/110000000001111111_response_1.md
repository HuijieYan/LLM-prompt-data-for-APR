The issue seems to be related to the `gunzip` function, which is supposed to handle Gzip decompression, but it appears to have problems with the implementation. The function is meant to read and decompress Gzip data, but it is not handling the process properly, leading to potential duplicate or corrupted data in the output. 

The root cause of the issue could be the incorrect implementation of the while loop and handling of Gzip decompression errors. The function is not properly handling cases where there is insufficient data or errors during the decompression process.

To fix the bug, the while loop should be modified to correctly handle the decompression and error scenarios. The function should also ensure that it properly checks for the end of the Gzip data to avoid duplicate or corrupted output.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    output = b''
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
    return output
```

In the corrected code:
- We use the `gzip` module to create a `GzipFile` object for reading the Gzip data.
- We use a `while True` loop to read chunks of data from the Gzip file until no more data is available.
- We concatenate the chunks to the `output` variable.
- We return the decompressed `output` after the loop ends.

This should provide a corrected and functional implementation of the `gunzip` function, resolving the issues related to duplicate or corrupted data.
