The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not found. This means that the function is expecting a file path as input, but it's being passed the actual content of the file instead. 

The potential error location in the function is where it expects the input 'data' to be a file object but instead is being treated as the content of the file.

The bug is occurring because the 'gunzip' function is expecting a file object as input to be gunzipped, but it is being passed the file content directly.

To fix the bug, modify the 'gunzip' function to accept a file path as input, and then open the file within the function to read its content. Then perform the gunzip operation on the file content.

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(file_path):
    """Gunzip the given file and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        output = b''
        f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
        chunk = b'.'
        while chunk:
            try:
                chunk = f.read(8196)
                output += chunk
            except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
                if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                    try:
                        output += f.extrabuf
                    finally:
                        break
                else:
                    raise
        return output
```
