The test case 'test_gunzip_illegal_eof' is trying to open a file 'unexpected-eof.gz' which does not exist. This means that the test case is unable to find the file to read its content and then pass it to the 'gunzip' function. The error message indicates a 'FileNotFoundError', which means the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not found in the specified path.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'gunzip' function itself, as it seems to be working with the input 'data' that is being passed to it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'gunzip' function is trying to read a file that does not exist, resulting in a 'FileNotFoundError' during the execution of the test case.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the test case to use a valid file path. This could involve providing a valid file path to the 'open' function call in the test case.

Another approach is to modify the 'gunzip' function to accept a file path as input rather than raw data, and then read the content of the file within the function, ensuring that the file exists before attempting to read it.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to handle the 'FileNotFoundError' exception within the test case to provide a more informative error message in case the file is not found.

Corrected 'gunzip' function:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(file_path):
    """Gunzip the data from the given file and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        data = file.read()
        with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
            return f.read()
```

By modifying the 'gunzip' function to accept a file path and then reading the content of the file within the function, the function becomes more modular and the test case can be easily adapted to use a valid file path for testing.
