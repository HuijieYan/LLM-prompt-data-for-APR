The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError`, which suggests that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not found. This means that the file path specified in the test is incorrect.

Looking at the `gunzip` function, the potential error location is in the `with open(join(SAMPLEDIR, 'unexpected-eof.gz'), 'rb')` line in the test function. This line is trying to open the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' for reading, but it is unable to find the file at the specified path.

The bug in the `gunzip` function appears to be related to the erroneous file path specified in the test function, rather than within the `gunzip` function itself.

To fix the issue, the correct file path for 'unexpected-eof.gz' should be specified in the test function. This will ensure that the file is found and can be opened for reading, addressing the `FileNotFoundError` encountered during the test.

Corrected code for the `gunzip` function is provided below:

```python
import gzip

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.open(data, 'rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
    return output
```
