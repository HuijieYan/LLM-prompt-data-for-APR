1. The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' cannot be found, which is causing a FileNotFoundError.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'gunzip' function, which is responsible for decompressing the gzip data.
3. The bug is most likely caused by the 'gunzip' function not handling the file reading process correctly, resulting in the inability to find the specified file.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'gunzip' function so that it properly handles the file reading process and decompression of the gzip data.
5. Below is the corrected code for the 'gunzip' function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
        return output
```
