The test case `test_send_single_values_to_and_cc` is trying to send an email with a single recipient and a carbon copy (cc) recipient. However, the error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `extend` method being called on a string object (`cc`), which suggests that the `cc` parameter is being passed as a string instead of a list.

The bug is located in the `send` method of the `MailSender` class. The code performs a check for the `cc` parameter, but it assumes that `cc` should be a list. If it's not a list, the code will fail when trying to call the `extend` method on a string.

The bug occurs because the `cc` parameter is being passed as a string instead of a list when calling the `mailsender.send` method.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `send` method to handle the `cc` parameter properly, whether it is passed as a single recipient or a list of recipients.

Here's the corrected code for the `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to[:]
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):
            rcpts.append(cc)  # append single cc recipient
        elif isinstance(cc, list):
            rcpts.extend(cc)  # extend with list of cc recipients
        msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join([cc] if isinstance(cc, str) else cc)  # handle Cc header
        
    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)
    
    # ... rest of the method remains unchanged ...
    
    if _callback:
        _callback(to=to, subject=subject, body=body, cc=cc, attach=attachs, msg=msg)
    
    # ... rest of the method remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, we handle the `cc` parameter properly by checking its type. If it's a string, we append it to the list of recipients (`rcpts`). If it's a list, we extend the list.

These changes should address the `AttributeError` and handle the `cc` parameter correctly in the `send` method.
