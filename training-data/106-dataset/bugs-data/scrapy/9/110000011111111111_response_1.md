The error message is indicating that there is an AttributeError at line 57 of the `send` method in the `scrapy/mail.py` file. The error occurs when attempting to call the `extend` method on a string object, which suggests that the variable `rcpts` is not a list as intended, and it might be assigned incorrectly.

The bug occurs because the `rcpts` variable is erroneously assigned as a copy of `to` with `[:]` in line 17. So, when the `cc` is included, it tries to extend a string with the `extend` method. 

To fix this bug, the `rcpts` variable should be set to `to` instead of creating a copy with `[:]`, and then `cc` should be added to the `rcpts` list if it is provided.

Here's the corrected `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to  # corrected assignment
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, list):
            rcpts.extend(cc)
        else:
            rcpts.append(cc)
        msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join(cc)

    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)

    # remaining code unchanged
```

With this correction, the `rcpts` variable is assigned to `to` directly, and if `cc` is provided, it's added to the `rcpts` list. This should fix the AttributeError that occurred due to the incorrect handling of `rcpts`.
