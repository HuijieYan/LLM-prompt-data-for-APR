The potential error location in the code is the if statement that checks if there are any attachments. If there are attachments, the code creates a MIMEMultipart message, otherwise it creates a MIMENonMultipart message. However, the code mistakenly uses MIMENonMultipart instead of MIMEMultipart for the else condition, which causes an error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to create an instance of a non-existent class MIMENonMultipart, instead of using MIMEMultipart for multipart messages without attachments.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `MIMENonMultipart` with `MIMEMultipart` for the else condition when there are no attachments.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MailSender(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
        if attachs:
            msg = MIMEMultipart()
        else:
            msg = MIMEText(body, mimetype, charset)
        # ... remaining code unchanged ...
```
