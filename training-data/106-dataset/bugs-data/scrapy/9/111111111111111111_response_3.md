The test case `test_send_single_values_to_and_cc` is trying to send an email using the `mailsender.send` method with a specified recipient, subject, body, and carbon copy (cc). However, the error message indicates an AttributeError at line 57 in the `scrapy/mail.py` file. The error specifically highlights that a 'str' object does not have an attribute 'extend'. This error likely occurs when trying to extend the recipient list with the carbon copy list.

The potential error location is identified in the `send` method when trying to extend the recipients list with the carbon copy list:

```python
if cc:
    rcpts.extend(cc)
```

The error occurs because when cc is provided, it's a string, not a list, therefore causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `send` method to correctly handle the case when cc is provided as a string. We can convert the cc into a list if it's not already a list and then proceed to extend the recipient list.

Here is the corrected code for the `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    rcpts = to[:]
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):  # Convert cc to a list if it's a string
            cc = [cc]
        rcpts.extend(cc)  # Extend the recipients list with the cc list

    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)

    # ... Rest of the method ...
```
