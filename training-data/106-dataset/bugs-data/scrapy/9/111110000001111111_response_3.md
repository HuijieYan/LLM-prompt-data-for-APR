The code contains a bug when the `msg` object is being created. Depending on the value of `attachs`, the `msg` object should be of type `MIMEMultipart` or `MIMENonMultipart`. However, the code incorrectly creates a `MIMENonMultipart` object if `attachs` is empty, and a `MIMEMultipart` object if `attachs` is not empty.

This causes a TypeError when the `msg` needs to be used later, as it's not always guaranteed to be of type `MIMEMultipart` or `MIMENonMultipart`.

To fix this, we can create the `msg` object based on the presence of the `attachs` variable. If `attachs` is empty, the `msg` should be of type`MIMEMultipart`. If `attachs` is not empty, the `msg` should be of type `MIMENonMultipart`.

Here's the corrected code for the `send` method with the bug fix:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
        if attachs:
            msg = MIMEMultipart()
        else:
            msg = MIMENonMultipart('text', 'plain')
        # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```
