1. The test case `test_send_single_values_to_and_cc` is trying to send an email using the `MailSender` object with a specified recipient, subject, body, and carbon copy (cc). The `_catch_mail_sent` method is passed as the callback function.

2. The error is occurring in the `send` method of the `MailSender` class, specifically when handling the cc (carbon copy) recipients.

3. The error is due to trying to use the `extend` method on the `cc` variable, which is expected to be a list but is actually a string. The code assumes that `cc` will be a list, leading to the `AttributeError`.

4. To fix the bug, it's necessary to check the type of the `cc` variable and convert it to a list if it's not already a list (i.e., if it's a string).

5. Below is the corrected code for the `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to[:]
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):  # Check if cc is a string
            cc = [cc]  # Convert cc to a list
        rcpts.extend(cc)

        msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join(cc)

    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)

    # Remaining code for attachments and callbacks...


    ```
With this correction, the code will properly handle the cc recipients, whether it's provided as a single email address (string) or a list of email addresses.
