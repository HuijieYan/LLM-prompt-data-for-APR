The potential error in the provided code is within the `send` function. The bug appears to be related to the use of the `MIMENonMultipart` class, but the correct class to use is `MIMEText` when there are no attachments.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is attempting to use `MIMENonMultipart` when there are no attachments, which is incorrect. Instead, it should use `MIMEText` to handle the body of the email when there are no attachments.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to use `MIMEText` when there are no attachments, and use `MIMEMultipart` when there are attachments.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
    from email.mime.text import MIMEText

    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMEText(body, mimetype, charset)
        
    # ... rest of the code remains the same ...
```
