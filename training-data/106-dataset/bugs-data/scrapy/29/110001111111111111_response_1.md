The error occurs in the function `request_httprepr` when it tries to concatenate a string with the value of `parsed.hostname`, which is `None` in the second test case. This triggers an error when the `to_bytes` function is called with `None` as the input.

The issue is happening because the URL `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt` does not contain a `hostname` component. The `urlparse_cached` function used in the `request_httprepr` function does not handle the case of FTP URLs.

To fix this, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle the case of FTP URLs where `parsed.hostname` can be `None`. We can also add a conditional check to handle this case before attempting to concatenate the `parsed.hostname`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before trying to concatenate it with the rest of the HTTP request representation.
