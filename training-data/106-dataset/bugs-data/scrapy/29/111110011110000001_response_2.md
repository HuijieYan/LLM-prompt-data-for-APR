Potential Error Location:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, causing a `TypeError`. This is likely happening in the line where `parsed.hostname` is being passed to `to_bytes` as it is the only usage of `to_bytes` in the function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object and resulting in a `TypeError`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before passing it to `to_bytes`.
2. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, handle it appropriately, for example by using a default value or skipping that part of the HTTP representation.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
In the corrected code, the `if parsed.hostname` condition is added to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
