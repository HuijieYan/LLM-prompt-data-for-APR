The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is not properly handling the case when the parsed URL does not have a `hostname`. This causes the `s` variable to be incorrect when creating the HTTP representation.

The error occurs because the code assumes that every parsed URL will have a `hostname`, but for certain schemes like "file", "hostname" might not be available.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when there is no `hostname` in the parsed URL and adjust the `Host` header accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers
from twisted.web.iweb import IRequest

def request_httprepr(request: IRequest) -> bytes:
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the presence of `parsed.hostname` before adding the `Host` header to the HTTP representation. This ensures that the `Host` header is added only when the URL has a `hostname`. This should fix the bug and make the function handle different URL schemes correctly.
