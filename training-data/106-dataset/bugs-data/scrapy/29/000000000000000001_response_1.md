Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the `urlparse_cached` function and the `to_bytes` function. These are not standard Python functions and may be custom functions implemented by the developer.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. It seems that the `urlparse_cached` function is expected to parse the request URL, but it is not a standard Python function, so it might be causing the issue.
2. Similarly, the `to_bytes` function is likely another custom function which is not standard in Python.

Possible fixes:
1. Replace the `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` function with their standard Python equivalents, i.e., `urllib.parse.urlparse` and `bytes()`.
2. Check if the `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions are defined elsewhere in the code, and ensure that they are implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
