The potential error in the provided function is on the line `parsed = urlparse_cached(request)`. This is likely causing an error because `urlparse_cached` is not a defined function in the code provided.

The bug is likely to be occurring because the `urlparse_cached` function is not a standard Python function, it might be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase or possibly an external library. 

To fix this bug, the `urlparse_cached` function needs to be correctly defined or imported from the appropriate source. If it is a custom function, it needs to ensure that it correctly parses the URL and returns the necessary components.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += key.encode('utf-8') + b": " + value.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module has been used to parse the URL, and the relevant components are extracted to form the HTTP representation. Additionally, the method and headers are encoded to bytes before concatenation for proper byte representation.
