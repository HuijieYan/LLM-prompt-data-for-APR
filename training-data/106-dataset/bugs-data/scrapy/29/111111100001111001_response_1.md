The error in the given function is that the urlparse_cached function is not defined, which causes a NameError when the function is called. The urlparse_cached function is likely meant to be the urlparse function from the urllib.parse module.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the undefined urlparse_cached function with urlparse from urllib.parse.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_unicode().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we have imported the necessary functions from the urllib.parse module and used the correct method to encode the strings. Also, we have replaced the undefined urlparse_cached function with urlparse.
