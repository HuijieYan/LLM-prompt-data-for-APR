Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given function is in the generation of the HTTP request string. It seems that the function is not handling the URL correctly, particularly in parsing the hostname and path.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug could be occurring due to the incorrect parsing of the request URL. The `urlparse_cached` function is not defined in the provided code, so we can assume it's a wrapper around Python's urlparse function. It seems that the `urlunparse` function is also used to construct the path, but the logic for constructing the complete URL is not correct. Additionally, the parsing of the hostname from the URL is also missing.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `urlparse` function from Python's `urllib` library to parse the URL and extract the hostname and path.
2. Construct the complete URL by combining the scheme, netloc (combination of hostname and port if present), path, and query parameters.
3. Use the `geturl` method of the parsed URL to get the complete URL.
4. Ensure that the `parsed` object is properly constructed and all necessary components such as scheme, netloc, path, query, etc. are handled correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    netloc = parsed.netloc if parsed.port else f"{parsed.hostname}:{parsed.port}"
    url = urlunparse((parsed.scheme, netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
