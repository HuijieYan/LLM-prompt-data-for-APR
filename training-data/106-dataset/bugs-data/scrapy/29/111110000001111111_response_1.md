The buggy function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, there are several potential issues in the function that need to be fixed.

1. The 'urlparse_cached' function is not defined or imported, which will cause an error.
2. The variable 'parsed' is used without being defined, and it seems to be the result of the 'urlparse_cached' function. This needs to be fixed.
3. The 'urlunparse' function is also not defined or imported.
4. The 'to_bytes' function is used without being defined or imported.
5. The concatenation of byte strings and other variables may cause issues with the formatting of the HTTP representation.

To fix the issues, we need to import necessary modules (e.g., urllib.parse) and define the 'to_bytes' function if it's a custom utility function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import urllib.parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(request.uri)
    path = urllib.parse.urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code:
- The necessary functions and modules have been imported.
- The 'parsed' variable is now obtained using 'urllib.parse.urlparse'.
- The 'to_bytes' function has been replaced with the 'encode' method to convert strings to bytes.
- The concatenation of byte strings and other variables have been properly encoded to ensure correct formatting of the HTTP representation.
