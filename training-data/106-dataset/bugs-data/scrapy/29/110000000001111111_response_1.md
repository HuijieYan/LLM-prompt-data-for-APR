Potential error location: 
The `urlparse_cached` function is used in the code, but it is not defined in the given function. It seems that the intention was to use Python's `urllib.parse.urlparse()` function, but it was mistakenly referred to as `urlparse_cached`.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: 
The `urlparse_cached` function is not a standard Python function, so the code will raise an error when trying to call it. Additionally, the parsing of the URL and extraction of its components from the request is not being done correctly, which will result in incorrect HTTP representation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `urlparse_cached` with Python's built-in `urlparse` function.
2. Ensure that the URL components (path, params, query) are extracted correctly and used to construct the raw HTTP representation.
3. Handle cases where the URL does not have a path or has an empty path.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
