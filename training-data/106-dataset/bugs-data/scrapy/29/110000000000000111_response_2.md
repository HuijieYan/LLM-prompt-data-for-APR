Potential error: The `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are not imported or defined in the code.

Reason for the bug: The code is trying to use the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions without importing them or defining them within the code.

Correction:
1. Import the necessary functions from the relevant module or library.
2. Use the imported functions to properly parse and unparse the URL.

Corrected code:

```python
from twisted.web.sux import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.web.http_headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, I assumed that the necessary functions are located in the `twisted.web.sux` and `twisted.web.http_headers` modules. If that is not the case, the correct module or library should be imported instead.
