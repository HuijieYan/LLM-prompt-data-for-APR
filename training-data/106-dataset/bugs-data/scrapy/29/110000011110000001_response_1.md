The error is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` as it cannot convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)  # Using urlparse from six.moves.urllib.parse to avoid NameError
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Providing a default value for parsed.hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

# A test function for the buggy function
def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request():
    # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
    request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
    request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```

With the above correction, the code should handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, providing a default value and preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
