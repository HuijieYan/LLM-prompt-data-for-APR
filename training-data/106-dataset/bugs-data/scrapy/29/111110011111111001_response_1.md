The error message indicates a `TypeError` raised in the `to_bytes` function, specifically when attempting to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes. The input parameter `text` for the `to_bytes` function is `None`, causing the error.

The potential error location within the function is the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` expression.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being properly parsed from the input `request`, resulting in a `None` value.

To fix this bug, we should first ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is correctly parsed from the input `request`. We also need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to convert it to bytes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

The corrected code includes a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it's not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. If it's `None`, the "Host" line will not be added to the HTTP representation.
