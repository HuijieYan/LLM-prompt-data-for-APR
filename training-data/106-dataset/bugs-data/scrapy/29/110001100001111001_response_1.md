Potential error location:
The error might occur in the line that concatenates the request body to the variable 's'. This is because 's' is defined to be of type bytes, and when concatenating with the request body, there might be an issue with the type compatibility.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The issue might be occurring because the request body is being concatenated directly to the 's' variable, which is of type bytes. This can lead to a type mismatch error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert the request body to bytes before concatenating it with the 's' variable.
2. Use the `encode()` method to convert the request body to bytes before concatenating.

Corrected code:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body) # Convert request body to bytes before concatenating
    return s
```
