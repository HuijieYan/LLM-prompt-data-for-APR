Potential Error Location:
The error could be caused by the `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions as they are not defined in the provided code.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions are not defined in the code, causing the function to fail when these undefined functions are called.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions within the code.
2. Import the necessary libraries that contain these functions if they are supposed to be external libraries.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        for key, value in request.headers.items():
            s += (key + ": " + value + "\r\n").encode('utf-8')
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
