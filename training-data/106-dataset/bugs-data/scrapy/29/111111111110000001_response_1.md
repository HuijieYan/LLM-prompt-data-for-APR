The error message indicates a 'TypeError' within the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called within the 'request_httprepr' function. This suggests that the 'parsed.hostname' variable is None, which is causing the 'to_bytes' function to raise a TypeError.

The potential error location is the line where 'parsed.hostname' is being used to concatenate with other bytes. This indicates that the 'parsed' variable, obtained from the 'urlparse_cached' function, is not being properly handled when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https'.

The bug occurs because the 'urlparse_cached' function is not handling non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs properly, and when the URL scheme is not HTTP/HTTPS, the 'parsed' variable ends up with a None value for 'hostname', leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can check if the scheme of the URL is 'http' or 'https' before using the 'parsed' variable to extract the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the 'request_httprepr' function:

```python
from scrapy.http import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported URL scheme for HTTP request: {}".format(parsed.scheme))
