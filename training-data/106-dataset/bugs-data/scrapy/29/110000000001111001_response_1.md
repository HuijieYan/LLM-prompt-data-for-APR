The potential error in the given function is that the functions `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` are not defined within the scope of the function. 

The `urlparse_cached` function seems to be a custom implementation of parsing a URL, and the `to_bytes` function is likely a custom implementation of converting a string to bytes. These functions are not defined in the given code, leading to the function failing due to undefined variables.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `urlparse_cached` function and the `to_bytes` function, or use the built-in `urllib.parse` and `str.encode` functions to achieve the same functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import urllib.parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urllib.parse.urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code:
- I used the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from `urllib.parse` to parse and construct the URL.
- I used the `encode()` method to convert strings to bytes.
- I directly accessed the `url` and `method` attributes of the `request` object without the need for custom `urlparse_cached` and `to_bytes` functions.
