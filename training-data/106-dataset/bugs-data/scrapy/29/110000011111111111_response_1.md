The error occurs in the `request_httprepr()` function when it tries to access `parsed.hostname` to construct the HTTP request. The error message indicates that `to_bytes()` is receiving a `NoneType` value, which means `parsed.hostname` is evaluating to `None`.

The bug occurs because the urlparse_cached(request) function is not returning the expected result when the input request is in the format "file:///tmp/foo.txt" or "ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt". This is happening because urlparse_cached is designed for HTTP URLs, and it does not handle file:// or ftp:// schemes properly.

To fix the bug, the function need to be updated to handle non-HTTP URLs properly by addressing the handling of file:// and ftp:// schemes. To avoid NoneType errors, a check for parsed.hostname should be added before using it to construct the HTTP request.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from twisted.python.compat import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    if parsed.scheme in ('file', 'ftp'):
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the scheme is 'file' or 'ftp', and if it is, then we construct the HTTP request using the request.url directly. Otherwise, we construct the path using the parsed components as before. This way, the function can handle non-HTTP URLs properly.
