Potential error location:
The error may occur in the line `path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))` because the value of `path` is being set based on the `parsed` object, and if `parsed.path` is `None`, it is being replaced with `'/'`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error may occur if the `parsed.path` is None, the `urlunparse` function does not handle the `None` value correctly, leading to an unexpected result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the case when `parsed.path` is None separately and set `path` to `'/'` explicitly in that case.


```python
# Corrected function
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path if parsed.path else '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
In the corrected function:
- Imported `urlparse` and `urlunparse` from `urllib.parse`.
- Imported `Request` from `scrapy.http`.
- Imported `to_bytes` from `scrapy.utils.python` as this seems to be a custom function for converting to bytes.
- Used `urlparse` to parse the URL from the request.
- Handled the case when `parsed.path` is None separately and set `path` to `'/'` explicitly in that case.
- Used the parsed hostname for the Host header.
- Removed the references to `urlparse_cached` and used `urlparse` directly.
