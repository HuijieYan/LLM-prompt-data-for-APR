The issue with the `request_httprepr` function is that it's using the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, which are not directly imported or defined in the provided code. Additionally, the way it constructs the HTTP request is problematic. It's failing to include the port number in the `Host` header, and it's not handling non-empty request bodies properly.

To fix this issue, we need to import the required modules and modify the construction of the HTTP request to include the port number in the `Host` header and handle the request body correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    host_header = parsed.hostname
    if parsed.port:
        host_header += ':' + str(parsed.port)
    s = f"{request.method} {path} HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += f"Host: {host_header}\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += str(request.headers) + "\r\n"
    s += "\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s.encode('utf-8')
```

In this corrected code, we use `urlparse` from `urllib.parse` to parse the URL, and construct the HTTP request with the proper `Host` header that includes the port number. We also handle the request body correctly, and encode the entire request as bytes before returning.
