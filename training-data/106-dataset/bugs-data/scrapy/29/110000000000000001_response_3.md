Potential Error:
The potential error in the function is the urlparse_cached() function, which is used without being imported or defined within the function.

Reason behind the Bug:
The urlparse_cached() function is being used without being imported or defined within the function. As a result, the code will throw an error because the function is not recognized.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the urlparse_cached() function if it's a part of an external library.
2. If urlparse_cached() is a custom function, it needs to be defined within the same script or imported from another module.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
