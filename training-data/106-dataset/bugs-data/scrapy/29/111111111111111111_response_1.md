The error occurs at line 82 in the `request_httprepr` function in the `scrapy/utils/request.py` file. It indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is returning a `NoneType` value when it should be a string. This is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail as it expects the `text` parameter to be a string.

The potential reason for this bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is not being parsed correctly from the input URL. This could be due to the use of non-HTTP protocols such as FTP, which might not have a hostname in the same format as HTTP URLs.

To fix this bug, we can check if the URL protocol is HTTP before extracting the hostname. If it's not HTTP, we can handle the URL differently to extract the hostname, or handle the case where there is no hostname available.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme == 'http':  # checking if the protocol is HTTP
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"  # adding the hostname only if it's HTTP
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

This code includes a check to see if the protocol is HTTP, and only then does it attempt to extract the hostname. If it's not HTTP, the hostname will not be included in the raw HTTP representation.
