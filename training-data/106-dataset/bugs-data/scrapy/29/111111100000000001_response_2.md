Potential error location: The error is likely due to the use of the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, which are not imported or defined in the given code.

Reasons behind the bug: The code is referencing functions that are not included or imported in the given code, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the required functions from the appropriate modules.
2. Ensure that the referenced functions are available within the code or its dependencies.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import scrapy

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = scrapy.http.url.parse_url(request)  # Replace urlparse_cached with the appropriate function
    path = scrapy.http.url.unparse_url(parsed)  # Replace urlunparse with the appropriate function
    s = scrapy.utils.python.to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + scrapy.utils.python.to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + scrapy.utils.python.to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
