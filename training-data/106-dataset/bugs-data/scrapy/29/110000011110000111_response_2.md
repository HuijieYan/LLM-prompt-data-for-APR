The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This is likely happening when trying to get the hostname from the parsed URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
`s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing `to_bytes` to receive a `NoneType` object, which leads to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle this case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
