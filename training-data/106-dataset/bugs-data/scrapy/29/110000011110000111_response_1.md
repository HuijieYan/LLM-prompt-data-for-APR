The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` in the `request_httprepr` function is None, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`. This means that the parsed URL does not contain a hostname, which is why the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object.

The potential error location is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function.

The reason for this bug could be that the `parsed` object does not properly parse the input URL, resulting in a `None` value for the hostname.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before adding it to the HTTP representation. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
