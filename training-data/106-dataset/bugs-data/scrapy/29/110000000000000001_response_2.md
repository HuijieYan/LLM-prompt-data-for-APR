Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the concatenation of the HTTP request components, such as method, path, host, headers, and body.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
1. The use of `to_bytes` function is not defined in the provided code.
2. It is unclear where `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions are coming from, as they are not imported or defined in the provided snippet.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `to_bytes` function to convert non-bytes objects to bytes.
2. Import or define the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions to use them for parsing the request URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlunparse, urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string().encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if hasattr(request, 'body') else b""
    return s
