The test case describes a Spider subclass called `BlogSitemapSpider` that is designed to crawl blog pages. However, when the spider is run, it fails to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt and no pages are crawled. The error message "TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str" indicates that the `startswith` method is receiving a string argument when it expects a bytes or a tuple of bytes.

The bug is likely located in the `_parse_sitemap` method of the `SitemapSpider` class, where the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function is called. This function is used to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt.

The reason behind the bug is that in Python 3.x, the response body is returned as bytes, and when it's used as input to the `startswith` method, it expects bytes as well, not a string.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `response.body` is decoded into a string before being passed to the `startswith` method. Additionally, the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function needs to handle decoding of the input as well.

Here is the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` method of the `SitemapSpider` class:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith(b'/robots.txt'):
        body = response.body.decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(body.encode('utf-8')):  # Encode string back to bytes
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In this corrected code, the `response.body` is decoded into a string using the `utf-8` encoding and then passed to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function. Similarly, when sending the URL request for sitemap parsing, the string is encoded back to bytes before sending the request.
