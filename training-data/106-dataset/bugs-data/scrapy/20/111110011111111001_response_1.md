The error message indicates that the `startswith` method is receiving a string as its argument, but it expects a bytes-like object instead. This suggests that the `robots_text` variable is of type `str`, rather than `bytes`, which is causing the error when trying to access its elements using the `startswith` method.

The potential error location within the function is in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, which likely takes in a string (`robots_text`) as its argument and tries to use the `startswith` method on it, resulting in a TypeError.

The buggy function needs to handle the case when `robots_text` is not encoded as bytes, causing the `startswith` method to fail. The `robots_text` variable should be encoded as bytes using UTF-8 encoding to fix this bug.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        robots_text = response.body  # Assuming robots.txt response body is in bytes
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(robots_text):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
