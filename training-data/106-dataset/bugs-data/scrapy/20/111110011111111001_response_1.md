The error message indicates a TypeError in the sitemap_urls_from_robots function, specifically the startswith method. This suggests that the robots_text variable is of type bytes rather than a string, causing the startswith method to fail when it expects a string.

The buggy function doesn't have any syntax errors, but the issue arises from passing the response.body to another method, likely sitemap_urls_from_robots, which expects a string, but in this case, it receives bytes. This happens because the body attribute of the response object is of type bytes. 

To fix this bug, we need to decode the bytes into a string before passing it to the sitemap_urls_from_robots method. The modified code is as follows:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body.decode('utf-8')):  # decode the bytes to a string
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In this corrected code, we've introduced the `decode` method to convert the bytes type of response.body into a string, using the 'utf-8' encoding. This should resolve the TypeError issue, and the test case should pass without any errors.
