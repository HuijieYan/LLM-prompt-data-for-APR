The potential error in the provided code is the use of `response.body`, which returns bytes, in the function `sitemap_urls_from_robots` that expects a string for the `startswith` method. This inconsistency in data types is causing the `TypeError`.

The reason for the bug is the mix of data types: `response.body` returns bytes, but the `startswith` method expects a string. This issue arises due to the Python 3 migration, where previously, text was a sequence of bytes, but in Python 3, text is a sequence of Unicode characters.

To fix the bug, the bytes need to be decoded to a string before using the `startswith` method.

One approach to fix the bug is to decode the bytes to a string in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function before applying the `startswith` method. This way, the comparison will be between two strings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.text):  # Use response.text instead of response.body
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

The `response.body` has been replaced with `response.text` to ensure the comparison occurs between two strings. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
