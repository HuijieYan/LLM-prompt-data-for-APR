The error is occurring in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function when the `startswith` method is called with a string argument instead of a bytes-like object. This suggests that the `robots_text` parameter passed to the function is a string, but the code is trying to perform byte-oriented operations on it. This is likely due to the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, where strings and bytes are handled differently.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the `robots_text` argument is of type `bytes` before performing byte-oriented operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
        if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
            for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
                yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        else:
            body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
            if body is None:
                logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                               {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
                return

            # Ensure that the body is interpreted as bytes
            if isinstance(body, str):
                body = body.encode('utf-8')

            s = Sitemap(body)
            if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
                for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                    if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
            elif s.type == 'urlset':
                for loc in iterloc(s):
                    for r, c in self._cbs:
                        if r.search(loc):
                            yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                            break
```

In this corrected code, we check if `body` is a string and encode it to bytes if needed. This ensures that the `Sitemap` object and subsequent operations receive a consistent byte representation.
