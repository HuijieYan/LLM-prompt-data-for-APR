The test case is trying to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt using the `_parse_sitemap` method. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `startswith` method is being called on a string instead of bytes.

The potential error location is the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, which is called within the `_parse_sitemap` method. The `robots_text` being passed to `sitemap_urls_from_robots` is likely of type `str` instead of `bytes`.

The reason behind the bug is that in Python 3, text data is represented as Unicode strings (str) and binary data is represented as byte strings (bytes). When reading the response body, it's important to decode it into a string if it's in binary format.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `robots_text` within the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function to ensure that it is represented as byte strings (bytes) instead of Unicode strings (str).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body.decode('utf-8')):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In the corrected code, `response.body` is being decoded from bytes to str using `response.body.decode('utf-8')` before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function. This will ensure that the robots_text is in the correct format for further processing.
