Potential error location: The potential error in the code could be related to the iteration through the sitemap URLs and the construction of Request objects for further parsing. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code does not handle the case where the sitemap URLs are extracted from the robots.txt file correctly.
2. The iteration through the sitemap URLs and the usage of regular expressions for filtering the URLs might not be implemented as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for extracting sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file and handle it appropriately.
2. Verify the iteration through the sitemap URLs and the usage of regular expressions to ensure that the correct URLs are being processed.

Corrected code:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.text):  # using response.text to get the text content
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
