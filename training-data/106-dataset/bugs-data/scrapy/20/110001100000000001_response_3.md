Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the for loop that yields Request objects, as it may be causing an infinite loop.

Reasons behind the bug: The recursive call to `_parse_sitemap` within the for loop can cause an infinite loop, as the same function is being called repeatedly. This can lead to excessive memory usage and potentially crash the system.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to prevent the recursive call within the for loop, in order to avoid the infinite loop.

Corrected code:
```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_robots)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
``` 

In the corrected code, I replaced the recursive call to `_parse_sitemap` with a call to a different method `self._parse_robots` within the for loop to prevent an infinite loop. This should fix the bug and prevent the infinite loop from occurring.
