Potential error location: The bug in the code seems to be in the condition `if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):`, as it is not handling the case properly when the response URL does not end with '/robots.txt'.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not have a condition to handle the case when the response URL does not end with '/robots.txt', which leads to an incomplete flow of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add an else clause after the if statement to handle the case when the response URL does not end with '/robots.txt', and then continue with the rest of the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return
    
        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
