Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, specifically on the line that uses the `startswith` method on a string.

Reasons for the bug occurrence: The error message indicates that the `startswith` method is receiving a string as the first argument instead of bytes or a tuple of bytes, which is causing a TypeError. This likely means that the `robots_text` variable is being read as a string instead of bytes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, the `robots_text` variable should be encoded as bytes before using it in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function. This conversion will ensure that the `startswith` method receives bytes as the first argument.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        robots_text = response.body  # Store the response body as bytes
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(robots_text):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
In the corrected code:
- The `robots_text` variable is assigned the response body, which will be stored as bytes.
- This change ensures that the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function receives bytes as the argument, fixing the TypeError issue.
