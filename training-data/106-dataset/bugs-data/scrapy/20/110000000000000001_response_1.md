Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the for loop that iterates through the URLs obtained from the sitemap. It seems that the function is not properly handling the response from the sitemap, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The response from the sitemap is not being handled properly, which could lead to the function not generating the expected Requests or yielding the expected results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the response from the sitemap is properly handled and parsed.
2. Check for any errors in the sitemap parsing process and handle them appropriately.
3. Make sure that the URLs from the sitemap are processed correctly and used to generate Requests.

Corrected Code:

```python
from scrapy import Request
from scrapy.spiders import Sitemap
import logging

class YourSpiderClass:
    # other methods here...

    def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
        if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
            for url in self.sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
                yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        else:
            body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
            if body is None:
                logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
                logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %s" % (response), extra={'spider': self})
                return

            s = Sitemap(body)
            if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
                for loc in self.iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                    if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
            elif s.type == 'urlset':
                for loc in self.iterloc(s):
                    for r, c in self._cbs:
                        if r.search(loc):
                            yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                            break
