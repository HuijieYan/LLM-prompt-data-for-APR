1. The test case is trying to get the sitemap URLs from a robots.txt file, but it encounters a TypeError when trying to use the `startswith` method on a line of the robots.txt file.

2. The potential error location is likely in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, which is called within the `_parse_sitemap` method. This is where the TypeError is occurring.

3. The reason for the TypeError is that the `line` variable is being treated as a string, but it should be treated as bytes. This is likely due to mismatched data types, as the `robots_text` is passed as bytes but the `line` is being interpreted as a string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `robots_text` is properly converted to a string before splitting it into lines. Additionally, the `line` variable should be converted to bytes when using the `startswith` method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    robots_text = response.body.decode('utf-8')
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(robots_text.encode('utf-8')):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s", {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```
