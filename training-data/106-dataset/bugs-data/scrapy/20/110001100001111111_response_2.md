The provided error message states that the `startswith` method is expecting bytes or a tuple of bytes, not a string, meaning there is an issue with data type compatibility. This error occurs when the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function is called with a string type instead of bytes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body)` call.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `response.body` returns bytes, and the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function expects bytes as input. However, when the response is given, it is in the form of a string, causing a data type mismatch and leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `response.body` is used as input to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, because it accepts bytes-like objects.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s", {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

With this correction, the `response.body` is passed as an argument to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, ensuring that the data type match is maintained.
