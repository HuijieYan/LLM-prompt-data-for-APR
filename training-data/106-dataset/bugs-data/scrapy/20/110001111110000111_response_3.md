The test case `test_get_sitemap_urls_from_robotstxt` is trying to assert that the function `_parse_sitemap` should return a list of URLs extracted from the robots.txt file. However, the function is currently not returning anything.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function. This function seems to be expecting a byte string as input, but is receiving a regular string, leading to the `TypeError`.

The buggy function `_parse_sitemap` is not handling the response body correctly. The `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function expects a byte string, but the response body might be a regular string. This mismatch in data types is causing the `TypeError` and needs to be resolved.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to ensure that the response body is converted to a byte string before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_parse_sitemap` function:

```python
import codecs  # add this import statement at the top of the file

# ... (other code) ...

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body_as_unicode().encode('utf-8')):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

In the corrected code:
- The `codecs` module is imported to provide the `body_as_unicode` method to convert the response body to Unicode.
- The response body is converted to Unicode using `response.body_as_unicode()`.
- Then, it is encoded to a byte string using `.encode('utf-8')` before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and allow the function to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt correctly.
