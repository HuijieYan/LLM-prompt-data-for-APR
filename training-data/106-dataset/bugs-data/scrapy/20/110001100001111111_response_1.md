Based on the error message and the test case, the issue is related to the `TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str`. This error occurs in the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function from the `scrapy.utils.sitemap` module, which is caused by passing a string instead of bytes to the `startswith` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to `sitemap_urls_from_robots(response.body)`. The `response.body` attribute is expected to be of type bytes, but it seems to be of type str in the given test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `response.body` attribute of the `TextResponse` object is a bytes-like object, but in the provided test case, it has a string value instead. This could be due to a bug in the way the `TextResponse` object is instantiated.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `response.body` attribute of the `TextResponse` object is of type bytes. This can be achieved by encoding the string response to bytes using the appropriate encoding (e.g., UTF-8) before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_sitemap(self, response):
    if response.url.endswith('/robots.txt'):
        body = response.body.encode('utf-8')  # Encode the string response to bytes
        for url in sitemap_urls_from_robots(body):
            yield Request(url, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
    else:
        body = self._get_sitemap_body(response)
        if body is None:
            logger.warning("Ignoring invalid sitemap: %(response)s",
                           {'response': response}, extra={'spider': self})
            return

        s = Sitemap(body)
        if s.type == 'sitemapindex':
            for loc in iterloc(s, self.sitemap_alternate_links):
                if any(x.search(loc) for x in self._follow):
                    yield Request(loc, callback=self._parse_sitemap)
        elif s.type == 'urlset':
            for loc in iterloc(s):
                for r, c in self._cbs:
                    if r.search(loc):
                        yield Request(loc, callback=c)
                        break
```

The updated code fixes the bug by encoding the string response to bytes before passing it to the `sitemap_urls_from_robots` function, ensuring compatibility with the expected type. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and allow the spider to extract sitemap URLs from robots.txt as expected.
