1. The test case `test_request_meta_handling` appears to set up a mock request and response to test the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class.

2. The potential error location within the `process_response` function is likely the `urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])` line, where it seems there is an issue with mixing string and non-string arguments.

3. The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function in Python's `urllib.parse` module requires both arguments to be of type string. In this case, `request.url` is a string, but `response.headers['location']` is of type `bytes`.

4. To fix the bug, the value of `response.headers['location']` needs to be decoded to a string before being passed to the `urljoin` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response
    
    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response
    
    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    return response
```
