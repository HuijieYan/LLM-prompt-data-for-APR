The error in the code seems to be related to the conditional check for `request.method`. In the first buggy case, the request method is `'GET'` and in the second buggy case, it is still `'GET'`. However, the condition checks for `'HEAD'` method and handles the redirection accordingly. This can lead to incorrect behavior when handling redirections.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for `request.method` should be adjusted to correctly handle the 'GET' method.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
        response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'GET' or request.method == 'HEAD':  # Adjusted condition for request.method
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    return response
```

In the corrected code, the conditional check for `request.method` is adjusted to include both 'GET' and 'HEAD' methods, ensuring that redirection is handled correctly for both cases.
