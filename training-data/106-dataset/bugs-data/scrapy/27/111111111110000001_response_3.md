The error occurs in the process_response function of the RedirectMiddleware class. The urljoin method is throwing a TypeError because it's receiving a bytes object instead of a string. This is likely because the response.headers['location'] is returning a bytes object, which then results in a TypeError being raised.

To fix this issue, the bytes object needs to be decoded into a string. This can be done using the decode() method on the bytes object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin
# other imports...

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, we've added the decode('utf-8') method to the response.headers['location'] attribute to convert the bytes object into a string, fixing the TypeError issue.
