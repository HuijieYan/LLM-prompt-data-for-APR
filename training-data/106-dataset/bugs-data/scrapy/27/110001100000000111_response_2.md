Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is that the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class is not handling the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider properly. It is not respecting the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute when checking for redirect status codes.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` is not correctly handling the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute. This attribute is meant to specify which HTTP status codes the spider should handle, but the middleware is not taking this into account when processing the response.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the spider has a `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute and use it to determine if a response status code should be handled as a redirect or not.
2. Use the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute to compare against the response status codes and handle redirects accordingly.

```python
# Corrected code for the process_response method
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

The corrected code now includes checking the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute to determine if a response status code should be handled as a redirect or not. This fixes the bug and makes the `RedirectMiddleware` respect the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute as intended.
