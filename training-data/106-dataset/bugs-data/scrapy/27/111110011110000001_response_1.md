The error "TypeError: Cannot mix str and non-str arguments" occurred when trying to join the base URL with the redirected URL using the `urljoin()` function. This suggests that the arguments provided to the `urljoin()` function were not of the correct type. The error message indicates that the first argument is of string type and the second argument is of bytes type. This mismatch in argument types causes the `urljoin()` function to raise a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the second argument passed to `urljoin()` should be decoded to a string before being used as input. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, unquote

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, the bytes object obtained from the response headers is decoded to a string using the `decode()` method before being used as an argument to `urljoin()`. This ensures that the arguments provided to `urljoin()` are of the correct type and resolves the TypeError.
