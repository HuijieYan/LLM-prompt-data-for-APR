1. The test case is designed to test the handling of redirected URLs based on the response status and the Spider's handle_httpstatus_list attribute. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError related to mixing string and non-string arguments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the urljoin function, where the request.url and response.headers['location'] are being combined.

3. The bug occurred because the urljoin function expects both arguments to be strings, and in this case, one of the arguments is a byte string (b'http://www.example.com/redirected'). This mismatch of string types caused the TypeError.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both arguments passed to the urljoin function are of the same type (either both strings or both byte strings). We can achieve this by explicitly converting the byte string to a regular string before passing it to urljoin.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin  # import urljoin from urllib.parse

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # convert byte string to regular string
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # convert byte string to regular string
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # convert byte string to regular string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

By explicitly decoding the byte string to a regular string before using it as an argument to urljoin, we can ensure that both arguments are of the same type and fix the TypeError issue.
