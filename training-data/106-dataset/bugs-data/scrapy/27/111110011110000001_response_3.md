The error occurs when the `urljoin()` function is called with a combination of str and non-str arguments, leading to a `TypeError`. This error is triggered during the attempt to join the `request.url` and `response.headers['location']`.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is the usage of different data types (str and bytes) for the `request.url` and `response.headers['location']`. This mismatch in data types leads to the TypeError during the execution of `urljoin()`.

To fix the bug, the data types of the arguments passed to `urljoin()` need to be consistent. One approach is to ensure that both `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` are of the same data type before calling `urljoin()`. This can be achieved by converting the `response.headers['location']` to a string using the `decode()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the bug fix:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode())
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode())
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode())
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

With this correction, the `response.headers['location'].decode()` ensures that the `response.headers['location']` is converted to a string, resulting in consistent data types for the `urljoin()` function.
