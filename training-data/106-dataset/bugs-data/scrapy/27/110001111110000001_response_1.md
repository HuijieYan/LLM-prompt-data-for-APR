The error message is originating from the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error indicates that there is a mix of string and non-string arguments being passed to the `urljoin` function, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `'location'` value extracted from the response headers is expected to be a string, but it is encountering a non-string argument, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `'location'` value extracted from the response headers is always a string. This can be done by explicitly converting it to a string if it's not already a string.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Ensure 'location' is a string
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Ensure 'location' is a string
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Ensure 'location' is a string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

By explicitly converting the `'location'` value to a string using `str(response.headers['location'])`, we ensure that we are passing a string argument to the `urljoin` function, thus addressing the `TypeError` encountered.
