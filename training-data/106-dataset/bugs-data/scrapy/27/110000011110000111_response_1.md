The error occurs in the `process_response` method because the `urljoin` function expects both the `base` and `url` arguments to be of type string, but the `url` argument is of type bytes.

The bug occurs because the `response.headers['location']` is returned as bytes but the `request.url` is a string. This leads to a TypeError when `urljoin` is called.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` are of the same type (either both string or both bytes) before calling the `urljoin` function.

Here is the corrected `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        location_header = response.headers.get(b'Location')  # Use bytes for comparison
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and location_header:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location_header.decode('utf-8'))  # Decode bytes to string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    location_header = response.headers.get(b'Location')  # Use bytes for comparison
    if response.status in [302, 303] and location_header:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location_header.decode('utf-8'))  # Decode bytes to string
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and location_header:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location_header.decode('utf-8'))  # Decode bytes to string
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `location_header` is of type bytes for comparison, and then we decode it to a string before calling `urljoin`. This ensures that both `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` are of the same type before calling the `urljoin` function.
