The error is occurring in the `_test_passthrough` function of the `test_request_meta_handling` test case. The error `TypeError: Cannot mix str and non-str arguments` is being triggered by the `urljoin` function in the `_redirect` method of the `process_response` function. This is happening because the `response.headers['location']` is bytes type, and when concatenated with `request.url` (which is a string), it results in a mix of string and non-string arguments.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to convert the `response.headers['location']` to a string type before using it with the `urljoin` function. This can be achieved by decoding the bytes object using the appropriate encoding.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, the `response.headers['location']` is decoded using the UTF-8 encoding before being used with the `urljoin` function. This ensures that the concatenated arguments are both of the string type, resolving the TypeError.
