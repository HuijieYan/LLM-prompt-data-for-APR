There are multiple issues in the given code segment that need to be addressed:

1. The function `process_response` in the `RedirectMiddleware` class is supposed to handle redirections in a Scrapy spider. However, it contains some issues related to the `urljoin` usage, type incompatibility, and method invocations.

2. The test case `test_request_meta_handling` is designed to check the handling of request metadata in the `RedirectMiddleware` but is triggering a TypeError due to mixing of string and byte string arguments in the `urljoin` function.

3. The error occurs in the `urljoin` function due to a mix of string and byte string arguments.

To fix the issues:
- The `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods should be updated to handle URL joining correctly and ensure compatibility of the input types.
- The usage of `urljoin` should be changed to handle byte strings appropriately.

Here's the corrected `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
  # ... (other code)

  def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
    # ... omitted code ...

  def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
    # ... omitted code ...

  def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
          response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
      return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
      if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
      else:
        return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
      redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
      redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
      return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
      redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
      redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
      return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

By making these changes, the function now handles URL joining correctly and avoids mixing string and byte string arguments, resolving the TypeError in the test case.
