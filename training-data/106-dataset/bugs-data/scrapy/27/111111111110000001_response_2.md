1. The test case is passing a request URL and its metadata to the `_test_passthrough` function. Inside this function, a `Response` object is created using the URL, headers, status, and request, which is then passed to `self.mw.process_response` along with the original request and spider.

2. The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the usage of the `urljoin` function. The error message indicates that it has received a non-str argument, causing a `TypeError`.

3. The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function expects string inputs, but in this case, it's receiving a bytes object when trying to join the base URL and the relative URL provided in the response headers.

4. To fix the bug, the response URL should be decoded if it's a bytes object before being used with the `urljoin` function. This can be done by calling the `decode` method with the appropriate encoding.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
import six

# existing import for urllib
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# corrected process_response function
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        # Correct the bytes to string decoding
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8') if isinstance(response.headers['location'], six.binary_type) else response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
