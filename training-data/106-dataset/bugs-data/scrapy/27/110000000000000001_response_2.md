Potential error location: The potential error location is in the check for response status and the corresponding actions to be taken.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may occur because the if conditions are not properly structured and might not be covering all necessary cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Restructure the if conditions to cover all possible cases of response status and 'Location' in response headers.
2. Use a switch statement for better readability and manageability.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class ClassName:
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        elif response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        elif response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        else:
            return response
```
