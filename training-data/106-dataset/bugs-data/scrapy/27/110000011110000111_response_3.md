The error message indicates that there is a TypeError being raised in the urllib.parse.urljoin function, specifically due to a mix of str and non-str arguments being passed to it.

Looking at the function `process_response`, the issue seems to be with the `urljoin` function where the `request.url` is being joined with `response.headers['location']`. The issue is likely due to `request.url` being a string and `response.headers['location']` being a bytes object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that both `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` are either both strings or both bytes objects when passed to the `urljoin` function.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` are both converted to the same type (either both strings or both bytes objects) before passing them to the `urljoin` function. 

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
