1. The test case involves passing a URL with a status code of 301 and a meta field to the process_response function of the RedirectMiddleware. The expected behavior is for the function to return the response as is. However, an error is raised when trying to join the request URL with the 'Location' header in the response.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the urljoin function to join the request URL with the 'Location' header in the response.

3. The error occurs because the 'Location' header is in bytes format, but the urljoin function expects both arguments to be in str format. This mismatch in argument types leads to a TypeError.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to decode the 'Location' header from bytes to a str before using it in the urljoin function. Another approach is to ensure that the 'Location' header is always in str format. 

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ...previous code...

# this is the corrected function
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected function, the 'Location' header is decoded from bytes to str before using it in the urljoin function, ensuring that both arguments are in str format.
