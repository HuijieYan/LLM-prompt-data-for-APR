The issue with the provided code is that the `process_response` function is not properly handling the redirection based on the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where `response.status` is checked against `handle_httpstatus_list`. This check is not being done correctly, leading to improper handling of redirection.

The bug occurred because the `process_response` function did not appropriately handle the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. This caused redirection to not respect the specified HTTP status codes for handling.

To fix the bug, the `process_response` function needs to be modified to correctly check if the `response.status` is in the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute and handle redirection accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
