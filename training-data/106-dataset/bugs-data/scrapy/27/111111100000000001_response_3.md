The potential error in the provided code is within the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The bug occurs when `redirected_url` is being calculated and used in multiple if statements, which can lead to incorrect redirection since the `redirected_url` might be different in each case.

To fix the bug, we can calculate the `redirected_url` for each case separately using `urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])` and then create the `redirected` request using the updated `redirected_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, I've added the calculation of `redirected_url` within each if statement separately to ensure the correct redirection.
