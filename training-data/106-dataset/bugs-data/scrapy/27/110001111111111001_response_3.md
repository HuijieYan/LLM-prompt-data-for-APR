The error occurs due to a TypeError when attempting to join the base URL and the redirect URL. This error is caused by mixing string and non-string arguments when calling the urljoin function in the process_response method of the RedirectMiddleware class.

To fix this bug, the response.headers['location'] value should be converted to a string before calling urljoin. This will ensure that both the base URL and the redirect URL are of the same type (string) and the urljoin function can process them correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the process_response method of the RedirectMiddleware class:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

In the corrected code, the response.headers['Location'] is retrieved as bytes and then decoded to a string using the decode('utf-8') method. This ensures that the redirect URL is always of string type and can be correctly joined with the base URL using the urljoin function.
