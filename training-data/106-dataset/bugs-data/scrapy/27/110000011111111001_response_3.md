The error occurs when the `urljoin` function is called inside the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that it cannot mix string and non-string arguments.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` function expects both its arguments to be of type string, but the second argument `response.headers['location']` is of type bytes. This results in a TypeError being raised.

To fix this bug, you can decode the bytes object to a string before passing it to the `urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, the `response.headers['location']` is decoded using `response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')` before being passed to the `urljoin` function to ensure that both arguments are of type string.
