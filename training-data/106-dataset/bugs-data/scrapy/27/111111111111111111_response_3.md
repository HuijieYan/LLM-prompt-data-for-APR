The error occurs when the `urljoin` function is called within the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that it cannot mix string and non-string arguments. This is likely due to the `response.headers['location']` containing a byte string instead of a regular string.

To fix this bug, the `redirected_url` variable should be decoded to a regular string before being used in the `urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
import six

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
        
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
        
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        return response
```

In this corrected code, the byte string `response.headers['location']` is decoded using `decode('utf-8')` to convert it into a regular string before being used in the `urljoin` function. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring in the test case.
