1. The test case is testing the handling of HTTP status codes in the `RedirectMiddleware` class. It seems that the error occurs when the code tries to handle URL redirection.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class, specifically in the line `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])`.

3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by mixing string and non-string arguments. It seems that the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module is receiving a mixture of string and non-string arguments, which is not allowed.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `urljoin` function receives only string arguments, specifically for the `request.url` and `response.headers['location']` parameters. We also need to consider the possibility of non-string data in the `response.headers['location']` parameter.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `response.headers['location']` is decoded to a string before being passed to the `urljoin` function to prevent the `TypeError` caused by mixing string and non-string arguments.
