The problem with the `process_response` function is that it does not correctly respect the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the Spider class. This attribute is used to specify a list of HTTP status codes that should be followed, and the function should check if the response status is in this list.

The potential error location is in the section where the function checks for `handle_httpstatus_list` and the response status, as it is not correctly handling these conditions.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the Spider class when evaluating the response status. Additionally, the function does not respect the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute when making decisions about how to process the response.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the response status is in the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the Spider class. If it is, the function should return the response without further processing. Additionally, the function should handle the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute when making decisions about redirecting the request.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `handle_httpstatus_list` in the first `if` statement to return the response if the status is in the list. We have also updated the code to correctly handle the `Location` header and use `b'Location'` to access the header value.

This should fix the bug and make the RedirectMiddleware respect the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute.
