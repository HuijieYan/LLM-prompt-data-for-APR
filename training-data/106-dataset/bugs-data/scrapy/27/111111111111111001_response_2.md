The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])`. The error is a TypeError: "Cannot mix str and non-str arguments", which occurs due to mixing string and non-string arguments in the `urljoin` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the value of `response.headers['location']` inside the `process_response` function is of bytes type (b'http://www.example.com/redirected') instead of string type.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to decode the bytes object to a string. This can be achieved by calling the `decode` method on the bytes object, using the appropriate encoding. In this case, `utf-8` encoding can be used for decoding.

The corrected code for the `process_response` function is as follows:

```python
import scrapy
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect.RedirectMiddleware):
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

By decoding the `Location` header from bytes to string using the `decode` method, the TypeError will be resolved, and the function will behave as expected.
