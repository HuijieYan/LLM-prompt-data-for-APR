The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider is being used. In the provided code, the function `process_response` is not correctly handling the redirection based on the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`. 

In both test cases, the spider has a `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute. However, the function is not correctly using this attribute to determine whether to handle redirection or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly use the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute to handle redirection. This can be achieved by checking if the response status is in the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` and then performing the redirection accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced the direct comparison of response status with the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`. This change ensures that the redirection is handled based on the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` as intended.

This fix should address the issue and make the `RedirectMiddleware` respect the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`.
