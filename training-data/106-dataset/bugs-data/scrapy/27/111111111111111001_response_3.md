The error occurs in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates a type error, specifically mentioning the mixing of string and non-string arguments.

The bug occurs at this line of code: `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])`. The `response.headers['location']` returns a byte-string (a non-string argument), which is causing the error when trying to concatenate it with `request.url` (a string argument) inside the `urljoin` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both arguments passed to `urljoin` are of the same type. The byte-string should be decoded to a regular string before concatenating it with `request.url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of `RedirectMiddleware`:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... (other omitted code)

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get(b'location').decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get(b'location').decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers.get(b'location').decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, the `location` header from the response is decoded using `response.headers.get(b'location').decode('utf-8')` before being concatenated with `request.url` inside the `urljoin` function. This ensures that both arguments are of the same type (string) and resolves the type error.
