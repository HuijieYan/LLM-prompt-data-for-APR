Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the handling of the 'Location' header in the response status 302 and 303.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurs because in the response.status 302 and 303, the 'Location' header is not handled correctly. The method self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url) is used without being defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the method self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url) if it is supposed to be a custom method or find an alternative way to handle the redirection using GET method.
2. Properly handle the 'Location' header in the response status 302 and 303.

Corrected code:

```python
from w3lib.url import urljoin

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
