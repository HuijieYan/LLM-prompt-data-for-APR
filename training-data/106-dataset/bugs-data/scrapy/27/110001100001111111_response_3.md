The buggy function is `process_response` and it seems to have an issue with handling the redirect logic.

The error message associated with this bug could be something related to misdirected or incorrect redirects, or the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` not being respected.

The potential error location within the function is the sections where the code is handling the redirection based on the response status and the 'Location' header in the response.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly respecting the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the Spider. This attribute is used to specify a list of HTTP status codes that the spider is able to handle. If the response status code is in this list, the spider should be able to handle the response. However, the buggy function is not properly checking for this, leading to incorrect handling of redirects.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the response status code is in the `handle_httpstatus_list`. If it is, we should return the response without performing any redirects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...
    
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
        
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
        
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        return response
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the response status is in the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`. If it is, we directly return the response without performing any redirects. This ensures that the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` is respected and the redirects are handled properly.
