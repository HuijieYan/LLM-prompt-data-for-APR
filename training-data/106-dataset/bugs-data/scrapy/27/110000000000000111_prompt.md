# Buggy function source code

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Make RedirectMiddleware respect Spider.handle_httpstatus_list
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Inspired by #1334

I have decided not to include the HTTPERROR_ALLOWED_CODES setting, as, unlike the handle_httpstatus_list Spider attribute, the name of that setting implies that it is directly tied to the HttpErrorMiddleware.
```
