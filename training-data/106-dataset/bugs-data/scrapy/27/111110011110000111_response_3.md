1. The test case is attempting to pass a request URL with a meta attribute to the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates a TypeError related to mixing str and non-str arguments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `urljoin` function, specifically in the following line:
   ```python
   redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
   ```

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` function is expecting both arguments to be of type str, but in this case, `request.url` is likely a str, and `response.headers['location']` is likely a bytes object (indicated by the 'b' prefix in the error message).

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Encoding the `response.headers['location']` to convert it to a str before passing it to the `urljoin` function.
   - Checking the type of `response.headers['location']` and converting it to a str if necessary before using it in `urljoin`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```
