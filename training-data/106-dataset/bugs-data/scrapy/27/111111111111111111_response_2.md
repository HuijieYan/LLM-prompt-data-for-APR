The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to join the base URL with the 'Location' header. This TypeError is caused by mixing str and non-str arguments, as indicated in the error message.

The bug occurs because the 'Location' header is stored as a bytes literal (b'http://www.example.com/redirected'), while the request URL is stored as a string ('http://www.example.com/301'). When trying to join these two values using `urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])`, a TypeError is raised due to this type mismatch.

To fix this bug, we need to decode the 'Location' header value from bytes to a string before joining it with the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import urllib.parse

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode("utf-8"))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode("utf-8"))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode("utf-8"))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

By decoding the 'Location' header value from bytes to a string before using it in the `urljoin` function, we resolve the type mismatch issue, and the bug should be fixed.
