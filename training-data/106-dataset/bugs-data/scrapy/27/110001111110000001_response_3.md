The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the urljoin function in the urllib/parse.py file. It mentions the issue of mixing str and non-str arguments, which suggests that there might be an encoding or decoding problem when parsing the URL and the location header.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the urljoin function, specifically in the lines where it is used to join the base URL with the response headers' location.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the response.headers['location'] might not be encoded as a string, resulting in a TypeError when trying to join it with the base URL.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the response.headers['location'] is decoded as a string before using it with the urljoin function. This can be achieved by explicitly decoding the location header before passing it to urljoin.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode("utf-8"))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode("utf-8"))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode("utf-8"))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
