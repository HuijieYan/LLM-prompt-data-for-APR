The potential error in the `process_response` function lies in the condition `response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])`. This condition is checking if the response status is present in the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the `spider` object, but it is not handling the logic correctly as per the provided issue description.

The bug occurs because the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider is not being respected properly. The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition to check if the response status is not present in the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider, and then perform the redirection logic.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Modify the if condition to check if the response status is not present in the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider.
- Remove the unnecessary checks for `301` and `307` status codes, as they are already handled in the first if statement.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if not request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) and response.status not in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []):
        if request.method == 'HEAD' and response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        if response.status in [302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
