1. The test case is attempting to test the functionality of the `process_response` method in the `RedirectMiddleware` class. It creates a response object with a status code of 301 and a location header, then passes this response to the `process_response` method along with a request object and a spider object.

2. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method within the `RedirectMiddleware` class.

3. The error occurred because the URL passed to the `urljoin` function is in byte format (`b'http://www.example.com/redirected'`), and the base URL is in string format (`'http://www.example.com/301'`). This mismatch of data types causes the `urljoin` function to raise a TypeError.

4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the base URL and the URL being joined are in the same data type (either both in bytes or both in string). We can achieve this by decoding the byte URL to a string before using it in the `urljoin` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method in the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # other methods and attributes

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Decode the byte URL to string
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Decode the byte URL to string
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Decode the byte URL to string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, we have added `.decode('utf-8')` to the `response.headers['location']` to ensure it is decoded to a string before being used in the `urljoin` function. This ensures that both the base URL and the URL being joined are in the same data type, fixing the TypeError that was raised in the original code.
