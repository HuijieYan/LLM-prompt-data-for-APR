The bug in this function seems to be related to handling request redirects based on the response status and the 'Location' header. The function checks for specific response statuses and the presence of the 'Location' header to determine if a redirect is necessary, and then creates a new request accordingly.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the spider's 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute is not present in the request's meta. This causes the function to try and access a non-existent attribute, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks for the existence of the 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute in the request's meta before using it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    handle_httpstatus_list = request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
    
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in handle_httpstatus_list):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])  # corrected from 'location' to 'Location'
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])  # corrected from 'location' to 'Location'
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])  # corrected from 'location' to 'Location'
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we first retrieve the 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute from the request's meta and then use it as needed. We also corrected the references to the 'Location' header in the URL-joining logic.
