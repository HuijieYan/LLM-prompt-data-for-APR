The bug is likely in the `urljoin` function call. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to mixing string and non-string arguments. This suggests that the `response.headers['location']` in `urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])` is a non-string type, causing the error.

This bug occurs because the `headers` dictionary is of type `bytes` rather than `str`.

To fix this bug, the byte object obtained from the `response.headers['location']` should be decoded to a string before using it in the `urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            location = response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        location = response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        location = response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

By adding the `.decode('utf-8')` method to the `response.headers[b'Location']` bytes object, it is converted to a string. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring, as now both arguments in the `urljoin` function are of type string.
