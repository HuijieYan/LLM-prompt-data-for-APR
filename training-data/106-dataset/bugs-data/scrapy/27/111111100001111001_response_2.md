The bug seems to be in the handling of the redirect logic in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The bug appears to be related to the handling of the request method and URL when processing the response and checking for redirection status codes.

Potential error location: 
The bug might be related to how the request is being replaced and the method used to perform the replacement in the `process_response` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code does not handle the `handle_httpstatus_all` meta tag properly, leading to potential issues with the redirection logic.
2. There are redundant checks for response status codes and handling of redirection, leading to inconsistencies in the logic.

Possible approaches:
1. Update the logic to handle the `handle_httpstatus_all` meta tag properly, taking into account all status codes for potential redirection.
2. Simplify the logic for handling redirection to avoid redundant checks and inconsistent behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False):
            if 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling redirection has been updated to properly handle the `handle_httpstatus_all` meta tag and the URL replacement process. Redundant checks have been removed to ensure consistent behavior.
