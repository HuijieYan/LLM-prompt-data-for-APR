The potential error location within the problematic function is at the conditional statements that check for response status and 'Location' in response headers.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking if the response status is in the spider's handle_httpstatus_list. This is important because if a response status is in the handle_httpstatus_list, it should not be redirected. However, the function is not checking for this condition, leading to incorrect redirection when it shouldn't occur.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly check if the response status is in the handle_httpstatus_list. We also need to make sure that the function respects the spider's handle_httpstatus_list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
