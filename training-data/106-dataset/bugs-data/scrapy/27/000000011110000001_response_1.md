The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to mixing string and non-string arguments. The error occurs in the `urljoin` method of the `urlparse` library, indicating that there is a mix of string and non-string arguments being passed to the method.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the error is likely happening in the `process_response` method, specifically in the line that uses `urljoin`.

The reason for this bug is that the `request.url` might be of type `str` and the `response.headers['location']` might be of type `bytes`, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that both inputs to `urljoin` are of the same type. We can achieve this by decoding the bytes type to a string if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we decode the `Location` header from bytes to a string using `decode('utf-8')` before passing it to `urljoin`, ensuring that both inputs are of the same type.
