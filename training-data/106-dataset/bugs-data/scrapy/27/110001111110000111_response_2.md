1. The test case is attempting to test the functionality of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware`. It creates a response with a status of 301 and then calls the `process_response` method. The error message occurs when trying to extract the `Location` header from the response and join it with the request URL.

2. The potential error location is within the `process_response` method, specifically when trying to join the request URL with the `Location` header from the response.

3. The error occurs because the function is attempting to join a string and bytes object, which is not allowed in Python.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the URL and the `Location` header are both of the same type (either both strings or both bytes) before joining them. This can be achieved by encoding or decoding the URL or the `Location` header as needed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```
