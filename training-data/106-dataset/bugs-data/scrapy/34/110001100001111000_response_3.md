```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_34/scrapy/item.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)

```
The function incorrectly returns `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__` two times. The first one should be changed to return `super(mcs, ItemMeta).__new__`. This will ensure that the correct method is called and the function will work as expected.
