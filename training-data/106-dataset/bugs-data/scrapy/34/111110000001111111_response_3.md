The issue is occurring in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The problem seems to be that the `fields` dictionary is being overridden instead of merged when creating a new class.

The reason for this bug is that the `new_attrs['fields']` is being assigned the `fields` variable, which is an empty dictionary `{}`. This causes the fields to be overridden instead of merged.

To fix this bug, we need to merge the `fields` dictionary instead of overriding it. We can do this by updating the `fields` dictionary with the fields from the base classes. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `fields` dictionary is merged instead of being overridden when creating a new class.
