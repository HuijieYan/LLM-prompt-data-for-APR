# Buggy function source code
```python

# relative function's signature in this file

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
ItemMeta overrides fields, instead of merging it
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Looks like this update (#353) breaks the Item for the project I'm working on right now.

It now overrides fields, instead of merging it. @michalmo pointed it out to me after the item fields are having a key error.

Inheriting DictItem rather than Item fixed the problem though.
