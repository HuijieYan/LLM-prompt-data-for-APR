Potential error location: 

The error occurs with the `super` call in the `__new__` method. The first `super` call creates a new class, `x_class_name`, and the second `super` call is expected to return a new instance of the class with the provided `class_name`, `bases`, and `new_attrs`.

Reasons for the bug:

1. The `super` call in the `__new__` method is not using the correct arguments for creating the new class instance.
2. The new_bases, _class, fields, and new_attrs are not being correctly assigned, leading to incorrect values and types before the function return.

Approach for fixing the bug:

1. Use the correct arguments for the first `super` call to create a new class.
2. Assign new_bases, _class, fields, and new_attrs based on the correct logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {n: v for n, v in _class.__dict__.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    new_attrs = {n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if n in _class.__dict__}

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
