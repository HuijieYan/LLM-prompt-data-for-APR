The buggy function provided is intended to create a new class with modified attributes. Based on the analysis of the failing test cases, it seems that the bug lies in the incorrect creation of the new class and the modification of its attributes.

The bug occurs because within the function, after the `_class` is created, the function returns another call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. This is not the correct approach, as it effectively overwrites the previously created `_class` and associated attributes.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to make the following changes:
1. Remove the second call to `super(...).__new__` and directly return the previously created `_class`.
2. Update the logic to modify the new class attributes to ensure the correct attributes are added to the class.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
    
    attrs['fields'] = fields
    attrs['_class'] = _class

    return _class
```
