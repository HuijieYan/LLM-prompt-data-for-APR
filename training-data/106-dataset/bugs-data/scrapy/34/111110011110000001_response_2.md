The error message indicates that the `D.fields` dictionary does not match the expected value. The dictionary is missing the 'update' attribute. This suggests that the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class might be incorrectly creating the new class.

The potential error location within the `__new__` method is the line:
```python
return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the code is incorrectly constructing the new class. Specifically, it might not be correctly inheriting the attributes from the base classes in a multiple inheritance scenario.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly handle the input bases and extract the fields from the base classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        for n in dir(base):
            v = getattr(base, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
