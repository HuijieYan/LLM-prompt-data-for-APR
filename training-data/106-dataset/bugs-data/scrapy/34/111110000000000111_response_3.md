Potential error location: The issue lies in the `ItemMeta` class where the `__new__` method is not merging the fields from the base classes, but instead overriding them.

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation of the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is not merging the fields from the base classes with the fields in the current class. Instead, it is overriding the fields.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by modifying the `__new__` method to merge the fields from the base classes with the fields in the current class, rather than overriding them.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected version of the __new__ function
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        for base in bases:
            if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
                if 'fields' in attrs:
                    attrs['fields'].update(base.fields)
                else:
                    attrs['fields'] = base.fields.copy()
    
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)
```
