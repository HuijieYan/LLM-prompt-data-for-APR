The error message indicates that the `D.fields` dictionary is not as expected. It seems that the fields from both classes A and C are not being correctly merged in the class D.

The issue seems to be in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. This method is responsible for creating the new class object and updating its attributes.

The bug arises from the way the `new_attrs` are being calculated. The loop over attributes from the class `_class` (which is the parent class) should be skipped, and only the attributes from the `attrs` variable need to be considered for the creation of `new_attrs`.

To fix this bug, one approach is to remove the loop over attributes from the class `_class` and only consider the attributes from the `attrs` variable when creating the `new_attrs` dictionary. Additionally, the updating of the `fields` dictionary should consider both the existing `fields` as well as the new `fields` from the `attrs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = attrs.copy()  # Changed to start with all attributes from attrs
        for n, v in attrs.items():  # Consider all attributes from attrs
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
        for n, v in _class.__dict__.items():  # Consider all attributes from _class
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v  # Update fields with both new and existing attributes
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With these changes, the `new_attrs` across different cases would capture the desired attributes, and the merging of fields would consider both the new and existing fields. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
