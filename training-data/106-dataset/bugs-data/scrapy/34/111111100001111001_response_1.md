The problem with the provided function is that it is returning a new instance of the class with different bases based on a condition. However, it is missing the necessary code to handle all the bases properly, resulting in the bug. The return statement generates a new instance with `class_name` and `new_attrs`, which is also incorrect for the desired functionality.

The issue is related to how the `new_bases` and `new_attrs` are being used and manipulated within the function. The function logic also suffers from incomplete and incorrect handling of the class instance creation.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the bases correctly and update the attributes accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    attrs['fields'] = fields
    attrs['_class'] = _class

    return type(class_name, new_bases, attrs)
```
