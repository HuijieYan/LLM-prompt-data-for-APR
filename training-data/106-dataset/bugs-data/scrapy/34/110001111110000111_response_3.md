The error message indicates that the `D.fields` dictionary does not match the expected value. This suggests that the problem lies in the way the `fields` dictionary is being handled in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class.

The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is overriding the `fields` attribute instead of merging it with the new `fields` attribute from the base classes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to correctly merge the `fields` attributes from the base classes with the `fields` attribute from the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    if 'fields' in attrs:
        fields.update(attrs['fields'])

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this correction, the `fields` attributes from the base classes are correctly merged with the `fields` attribute from the current class, resolving the bug.
