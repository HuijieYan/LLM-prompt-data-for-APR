The bug resides in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The function is meant to filter out non-Field attributes from the base class and gather them together in the `fields` attribute of the new class to be created. However, the bug in the code prevents this from happening correctly.

The bug is caused by the incorrect creation of the new class, which omits some attributes from the base class that should be kept. Additionally, in the loop that iterates over the attributes of the new class, only three kinds of attributes are considered: fields, non-field attributes, and that which are not present in attrs. This approach misses some of the base class attributes if they are not present in the attrs of the new class.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to correctly create the new class based on the corrected attributes and fields. Additionally, the loop that iterates over the new class's attributes should consider all attributes from the base class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code will correctly create the new class by initializing it with the proper attributes from its bases and filtering out the non-Field attributes as expected.
