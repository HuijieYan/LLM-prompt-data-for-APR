The error is occurring in the `ItemMeta` class within the `scrapy/item.py` file. The issue seems to be related to the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class, which is not properly merging the fields from the base classes.

The bug is happening because the `__new__` method in `ItemMeta` is not correctly merging the fields from the base classes when creating a new class. Instead, it is overriding the fields, which leads to the incorrect behavior in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `__new__` method should merge the fields from the base classes and create a new dictionary of fields.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code should address the issue by properly merging the fields from the base classes and creating a new dictionary of fields. This should resolve the key error that was occurring in the test case.
