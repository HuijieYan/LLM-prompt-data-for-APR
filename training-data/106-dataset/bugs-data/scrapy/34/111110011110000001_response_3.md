Potential error location: 

The potential error location is within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The function tries to handle multiple inheritance by iterating through the attributes of the class and its bases. However, the logic for handling multiple inheritance might be incorrect, resulting in the wrong output.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method does not handle multiple inheritance correctly. When the `D` class is defined as `class D(B, C)`, the `__new__` method does not handle the fields and their default values properly when inheriting from both `B` and `C` classes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should properly handle the attributes and fields of the classes involved in multiple inheritances by correctly merging the fields from the base classes (`B` and `C`) when creating the `D` class.

Corrected code:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
        
        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for base in new_bases:
            fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))
        for n, v in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = v
                
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

The corrected `__new__` method addresses the issue of handling multiple inheritance by correctly merging the fields from the base classes. This ensures that the fields and their default values are properly inherited and merged when creating subclasses with multiple inheritances.
