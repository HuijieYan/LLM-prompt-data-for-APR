The error occurs in the `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond` test case where the `D` class has the incorrect `fields` attribute. The `D` class fields are being overridden instead of being merged, leading to a key error.

The potential error location within the function is the section where the `fields` attribute is being assigned to `new_attrs['fields']`. This section needs to be modified to merge the fields from the parent classes instead of overriding them.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is currently overriding the `fields` attribute in the parent classes instead of merging them when creating a new class with multiple inheritances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to merge the `fields` attribute from all the parent classes when creating a new class with multiple inheritances.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code modifies the `fields` attribute to merge the fields from all the parent classes instead of overriding them, thus fixing the bug.
