The buggy function is attempting to override the `__new__` method of a metaclass. However, the implementation provided is incorrect and is causing the bug.

The bug is occurring because the function is attempting to create a new class within the `__new__` method by using the `super` function, but it's not doing it correctly. The function tries to create a new class with modified bases and attributes, but it's not incorporating the changes correctly.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly create a new class with the modified bases and attributes. We also need to remove the unnecessary code and ensure that the new class is created properly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    fields = {name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field)}
    new_attrs = {name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if name not in fields}
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
    return _class
```
