The issue with the provided function is that in the loop where it processes the attributes of the class, it creates a new dictionary for `new_attrs` and then updates it with the `fields` and `_class` attributes. 

However, when it returns from the function, it creates a new class using the original `attrs` dictionary, which doesn't include the updated `new_attrs` with the `fields` and `_class` attributes. This is why the fields are getting overridden instead of being merged.

One approach to fixing this bug is to update the original `attrs` dictionary with the `fields` and `_class` attributes directly, rather than creating a new dictionary. This will ensure that the updated attributes are used when creating the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    attrs['fields'] = fields
    attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)
```
