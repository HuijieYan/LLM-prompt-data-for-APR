Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. It seems like the intention is to create a new class with modified attributes, but the code is calling `super` twice and attempting to create a new class with the same `class_name` and `bases` arguments.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is attempting to create a new class using `super` twice, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the code is not correctly modifying the attributes of the new class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the second call to `super` and modify the attributes of the existing class directly.
2. Create a new class with the modified attributes and return it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type('x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
