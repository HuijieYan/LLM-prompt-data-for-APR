Potential error location: The issue lies in the second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` within the `__new__` method. This recursive call creates an infinite loop and causes the function to run indefinitely.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is creating an infinite recursion by calling itself within the method body.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to remove the recursive call to `__new__` and instead call the `__new__` method of the parent class directly to create the new class instance.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
