The existing function is trying to create a new class by adding a prefix to the `class_name`, finding fields within the class based on certain criteria, and adding these new attributes and fields to create a new class.

The bug occurs due to the `__new__` method incorrectly creating a new class with modified attributes. Instead of directly returning the new class, it once again calls `__new__` for the `ABCMeta` superclass.

To fix the bug, the function should return the created class `_class` instead of calling `__new__` for the superclass.

Here's the fixed code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```
