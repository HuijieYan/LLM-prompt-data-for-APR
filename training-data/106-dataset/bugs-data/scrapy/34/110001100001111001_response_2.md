The issue with the provided code is that it has two `__new__` methods defined, which will cause a `TypeError` when the class `ItemMeta` is called. The primary reason for the bug is that the second defined `__new__` method returns a new-instantiated `ItemMeta` class with updated base classes and attributes each time it is called, which results in an infinite recursion. 

To fix this issue, we can remove the second `__new__` method definition entirely and refactor the original `__new__` method to achieve the intended functionality. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

    # Assign the new attributes and bases to the class
    attrs['fields'] = {n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    return _class
```

In this corrected implementation, we correctly handle the updating of base classes and attributes, as well as set the 'fields' attribute and return the updated `_class` object without causing infinite recursion.
