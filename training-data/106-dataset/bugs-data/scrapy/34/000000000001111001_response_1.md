The bug in the provided code is that the `__new__` method is calling `super().__new__` twice but using different parameters each time. The second call to `super().__new__` should be modified to use the `_class` instead of the original `class_name`.

The reason behind the bug is that the original code incorrectly initializes the class with a different parameter in the second call.

To fix the bug, the second call to `super().__new__` should be modified to use `_class` instead of `class_name`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, _class, bases, new_attrs)
```
