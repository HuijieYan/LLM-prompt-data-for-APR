The bug here is in the overridden `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. It is currently overwriting the `fields` dictionary instead of merging it when creating a new class that inherits from `Item`. This can cause the fields to be overridden instead of being combined, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing fields of the derived class.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to merge the `fields` dictionaries from the base classes instead of overwriting them.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base_class in new_bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base_class, 'fields', {}))  # merge fields from base classes

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, the `fields` dictionary is merged from the base classes using the `update` method. Then, the `fields` dictionary from the current class `attrs` is updated, ensuring that the fields are combined correctly when creating a new class that inherits from `Item`.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the fields are correctly inherited and combined in the derived classes.
