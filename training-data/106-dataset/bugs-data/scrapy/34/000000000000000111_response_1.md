The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it creates the new_attrs dictionary. This section should be responsible for merging the existing attributes with the new attributes, but it is currently replacing the existing attributes with the new ones.

The bug occurred because the code was overriding the existing 'fields' attribute in the new_attrs dictionary with only the fields from the current class, instead of merging the existing 'fields' attribute with the new fields.

To fix the bug, we should merge the existing 'fields' attribute with the new fields, rather than replacing it. This can be achieved by updating the 'fields' attribute with the new fields instead of assigning it directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    # Merge existing 'fields' attribute with new fields
    new_attrs['fields'] = {**fields, **attrs.get('fields', {})}
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
