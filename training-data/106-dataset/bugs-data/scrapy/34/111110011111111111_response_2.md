The bug in the provided function is that it is overriding the `fields` attribute instead of merging it when multiple inheritance is involved. This causes unexpected behavior when accessing `D.fields` in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to merge the `fields` attribute instead of overriding it. We can achieve this by updating the `fields` attribute in the `new_attrs` dictionary to merge the fields from all the bases.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this modification, the `fields` attribute will now be correctly merged from all the bases, and the bug in the test case should be fixed.
