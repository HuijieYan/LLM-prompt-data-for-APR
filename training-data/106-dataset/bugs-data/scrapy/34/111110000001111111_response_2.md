The bug occurs in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The issue is that when creating a new class, it does not properly merge the fields from the base classes, resulting in the fields being overridden instead of merged.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should properly merge the fields from the base classes with the fields in the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
# correct the buggy function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            for field, value in base.fields.items():
                fields[field] = value

    for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(attr_value, Field):
            fields[attr_name] = attr_value
        else:
            new_attrs[attr_name] = attr_value

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = new_class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code properly merges the fields from all the base classes and the current class, ensuring that the fields are not overridden but rather merged. This should fix the bug where fields were previously being overridden.
