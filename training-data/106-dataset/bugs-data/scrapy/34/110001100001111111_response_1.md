The issue seems to be that the `__new__` method is incorrectly overriding the `fields` attribute instead of merging it with the existing fields. This is causing issues with the inheritance and instantiation of the `Item` class.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__new__` method to correctly merge the `fields` attribute with the existing fields.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through all the bases and merge their `fields` attributes with the existing `fields`. Then, we update the `fields` with the new attributes from `attrs`. Finally, we set the merged `fields` in the `new_attrs` and return the new class using `super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`.

This should resolve the issue of the `fields` attribute being overridden instead of merged.
