Potential Error location: 
The issue seems to be with the second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the second call to `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is overwriting the previously created `_class` and `fields` attributes. This will result in losing important information and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Create a new instance of the class with the updated attributes rather than overwriting the existing instance.
2. Use a different approach to gather the necessary information without overwriting the existing attributes.

Corrected code:
```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
        fields = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
        
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
