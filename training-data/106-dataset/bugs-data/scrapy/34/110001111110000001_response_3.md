The error message indicates that there is an issue with the expected result in the test function `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond`. Specifically, the `D.fields` does not match the expected value.

Upon reviewing the provided code, it seems that the problematic function is the `__new__` method within the `ItemMeta` class. The bug occurs in this method due to the incorrect handling of class inheritance and attributes.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect manipulation of attributes and fields within the `__new__` method. Additionally, the handling of multiple inheritance in the test case might not be functioning as expected due to this bug.

To fix this bug, the `__new__` method needs to be corrected to properly handle the class inheritance and attribute manipulation. Specifically, the method should correctly iterate through the class hierarchy and aggregate the fields and attributes from the base classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method within the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(attr_value, Field):
            fields[attr_name] = attr_value
    
    attrs['fields'] = fields
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)
```

This corrected code properly aggregates the fields from the base classes and the current class, ensuring that the fields are correctly handled in the presence of multiple inheritances.
