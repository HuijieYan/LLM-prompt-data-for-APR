Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the recursive call to `__new__` in the buggy function. This can lead to infinite recursion and stack overflow.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The recursive call to `__new__` with the same arguments as the original call will result in an infinite loop, as it will keep calling `__new__` repeatedly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the `__new__` method to avoid the infinite recursion. We can also refactor the code to prevent the need for a recursive call.

Corrected code:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, I removed the recursive call to `__new__` and instead directly call `super()` to create the new instance of the class. This will prevent the infinite recursion issue.
