Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class, where it overrides fields instead of merging them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is not merging the fields properly, leading to overriding instead of merging.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should merge the fields instead of overriding them.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))  # Merge fields from all base classes
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the `fields` are now merged from all base classes, and then updated with the fields from the current class. This ensures that the fields are properly merged instead of being overridden.
