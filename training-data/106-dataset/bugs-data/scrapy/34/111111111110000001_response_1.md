The error message is showing an assertion error related to the comparison of the `D.fields` dictionary. It seems that the expected dictionary is missing the 'update' key-value pair compared to the actual dictionary.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the section where it constructs the `new_attrs` dictionary. It seems like the `new_attrs` dictionary is missing the 'update' key-value pair, which is leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `new_attrs` dictionary is not being constructed properly, leading to missing key-value pairs from the original `attrs` parameter.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to correctly construct the `new_attrs` dictionary by including all the key-value pairs from the original `attrs` parameter. Additionally, we need to include the 'update' key-value pair from the `_class` attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
    
    # Include all key-value pairs from attrs
    for k, v in attrs.items():
        new_attrs[k] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
