Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the code block that overrides the 'fields' attribute in the __new__ method of the ItemMeta class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The __new__ method in the ItemMeta class is overriding the 'fields' attribute instead of merging it with the existing 'fields' in the base classes. This results in the loss of fields from the base classes when creating a new class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Merge the 'fields' attribute with the existing 'fields' in the base classes instead of overriding it.
2. Update the logic in the __new__ method to correctly handle the merging of 'fields' from the base classes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
