Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the way the `fields` dictionary is being updated. It looks like the code is overwriting the `fields` dictionary instead of merging it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is replacing the `fields` dictionary with a new one, rather than merging the existing `fields` with the new ones.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to merge the existing `fields` dictionary with the new `fields` dictionary. One way to do this is by using the `update` method of dictionaries.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    # Merge the existing fields with the new ones
    fields.update(new_attrs.get('fields', {}))

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
