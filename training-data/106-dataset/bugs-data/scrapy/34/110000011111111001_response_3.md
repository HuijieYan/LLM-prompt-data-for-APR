The buggy function is named `__new__` and it seems to be a metaclass method for creating new classes. The function receives the class name, base classes, and attributes as input parameters.

The function seems to be incorrectly building the new class and its attributes. It iterates over the attributes of the new class, checks if they are instances of a `Field` class, and then creates a dictionary of fields. However, in the return statement, it calls `super().__new__` with the original class name, original bases, and new attributes, instead of the modified class name and bases. This seems to be modifying the original class instead of creating a new one.

Given the provided input and expected values, the function is not correctly creating the new class based on the input values.

To fix the bug, the function should create a new class using the modified class name and bases. It should also return the new class with the updated attributes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class.__class__('x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected function, the `__new__` method should return the newly created class using `_class.__class__` which will be the metaclass of the original class.
