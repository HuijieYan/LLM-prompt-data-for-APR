The test case is checking for the behavior of class inheritance and the fields associated with each class. The error message indicates that the fields are being overridden instead of being merged as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that returns the new class instance. This line is currently overriding the `fields` attribute instead of merging it with the parent classes' `fields` attributes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fields` attribute is being reassigned with each new class creation, causing it to lose the previously defined fields.

To fix the bug, we need to merge the `fields` attribute from the parent classes with the `fields` attribute of the current class.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected code, the `fields` attribute from the parent classes will be merged with the `fields` attribute of the current class, resolving the bug where the fields were being overridden instead of being merged.
