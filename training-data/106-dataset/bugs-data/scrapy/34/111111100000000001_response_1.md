The potential error in this code is that the function `__new__` is being called twice for the same class `ItemMeta`, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The first call creates `_class` by adding 'x_' to the `class_name`, and the second call tries to create a new class using `class_name` and `new_attrs`.

To fix this, we should remove the second call to `__new__` and instead modify `new_attrs` to contain the necessary attributes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return new_attrs
```
