The bug occurs because the function `__new__` is overriding the `fields` attribute with a new dictionary instead of merging it. This causes the `fields` attribute to lose its previous values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__new__` function to merge the `fields` attribute instead of overriding it. We can achieve this by updating the `fields` attribute by merging the existing `fields` with the new `fields` in the `attrs`. We also need to update the `new_attrs` to include the merged `fields`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    merged_fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            merged_fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    if 'fields' in attrs:
        merged_fields.update(attrs['fields'])

    new_attrs['fields'] = merged_fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
