The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__new__` method.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is not correctly handling multiple inheritance and is not combining the fields from the different base classes properly.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we correctly handle the fields and attributes from the base classes and combine them into a single class. We should also remove the line that creates a new class with the name 'x_' + class_name, as this is unnecessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        for n in dir(base):
            v = getattr(base, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
        for n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
