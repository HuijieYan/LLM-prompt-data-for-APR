The error message indicates that the `D.fields` attribute does not return the expected result. This means there is an issue with the `__new__` method in the provided code for the ItemMeta class. 

The problematic part of the function is:
```python
return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

The bug occurs because this return statement constructs a new class using the new_attrs, but it does not include the `fields` attribute.

To fix the bug, the new_attrs dictionary should be used to create the new class, and the `fields` attribute should be added to new_attrs before creating the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type('x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
