Potential error location: The __new__ method is not correctly constructing a new class based on the input arguments.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The __new__ method is not correctly processing the bases and attributes to create a new class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Utilize the type() function to create a new class.
2. Ensure that the new class is constructed based on the provided bases and attributes.

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

    fields = {}
    for n in attrs:  # Update field check to process input attrs
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    attrs['fields'] = fields
    attrs['_class'] = type(class_name, new_bases, attrs)  # Create a new class using type() function
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)
```
