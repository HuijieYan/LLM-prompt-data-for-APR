Potential error location: The second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` seems to be incorrect. It should be calling `__new__` on the parent class of `mcs` instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` is trying to create a new class, but the syntax and argument passing are incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the second call to `super().__new__` is correct and creates a new class with the correct arguments.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
