The test case `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond` creates multiple classes (A, B, C, D, E) that inherit from each other. It then asserts the attributes of these classes to check if they are set correctly.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs when checking if the `D` class has the correct `fields` attribute. It shows that the `fields` dictionary is not being properly merged and that the `update` key from class D is being overridden instead of merged with the `update` keys from classes B and C.

The bug is located in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass. The bug is caused by the logic in the `__new__` method that incorrectly overrides the `fields` attribute instead of merging it when creating a new class.

To fix this bug, the `__new__` method needs to be updated to correctly merge the `fields` attribute from all parent classes and the current class. This can be achieved by iterating over the base classes and updating the `fields` attribute with the fields from each base class.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    # Merge fields from base classes
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    # Add fields from the current class
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected `__new__` method, the `fields` attribute will be properly merged from all the base classes and the current class, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
