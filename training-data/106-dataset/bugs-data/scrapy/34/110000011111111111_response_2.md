The bug is occurring in the `ItemMeta` class, specifically in the `__new__` method. It appears that the function is not properly merging the `fields` attribute in the input `attrs` parameter with the `fields` attribute of the bases classes.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__new__` method is not correctly merging the `fields` attribute from both the input `attrs` parameter and the base classes. Instead, it is overriding the `fields` attribute with the one from the input `attrs` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to properly merge the `fields` attribute. We can achieve this by iterating through the bases classes and merging their `fields` attributes with the `fields` attribute in the input `attrs` parameter.

Below is the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        for name, value in base.fields.items():
            fields.setdefault(name, value)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected `__new__` method properly merges the `fields` attribute from the base classes and the input `attrs` parameter, resolving the bug.
