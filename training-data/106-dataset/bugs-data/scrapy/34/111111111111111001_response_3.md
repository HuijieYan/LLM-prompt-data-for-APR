The error message indicates that the `D.fields` dictionary does not match the expected value. It is missing the 'update' key in the comparison.

The issue seems to be in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class, as it is responsible for creating the class and populating the `fields` dictionary.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `__new__` method is creating the `_class` without properly updating the `fields` dictionary and `new_attrs` dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__new__` method to properly populate the `fields` and `new_attrs` dictionaries before returning the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

By updating the `fields` and `new_attrs` dictionaries before returning the new class, the bug should be fixed and the test case should pass without any errors.
