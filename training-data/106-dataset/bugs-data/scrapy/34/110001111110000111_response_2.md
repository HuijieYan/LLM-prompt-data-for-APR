The error message indicates that the D.fields dictionary is not as expected, which suggests that the fields are being overridden instead of merged when the Item subclass is created with multiple inheritance.

The potential error location within the provided function is the section that updates the new_attrs dictionary. It seems that this section is overwriting the fields instead of merging them when multiple inheritance is involved.

The bug occurred because the code was directly setting new_attrs['fields'] to the 'fields' dictionary, which caused it to be overridden instead of merged.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to merge the 'fields' dictionaries instead of overwriting them. We can do this by iterating over the 'bases' and combining their 'fields' dictionaries with the 'fields' dictionary from the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    # Merge fields from base classes
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            for field, value in getattr(base._class, 'fields', {}).items():
                fields[field] = value
    
    # Merge fields from the current class
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
With this corrected code, the 'fields' dictionaries from the base classes and the current class will be merged properly, addressing the bug where fields were being overridden instead of merged.
