The issue seems to be with the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class, where it is not correctly merging the fields from the base classes. Instead, it is overriding the fields, causing a key error when trying to access the fields.

To fix this issue, the `__new__` method should merge the fields from the base classes by checking for existing fields and updating them if necessary. The following corrected code for the `__new__` method fixes this issue:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
