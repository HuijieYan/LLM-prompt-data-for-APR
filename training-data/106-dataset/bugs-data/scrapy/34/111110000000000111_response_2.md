The buggy function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class is not correctly merging the `fields` attribute from the base classes. Instead, it is overriding the `fields` attribute with the one from the current class.

The bug is occurring because the function loops through the attributes of the `_class` and if an attribute is an instance of `Field`, it adds it to the `fields` dictionary. Then, it overrides the `fields` attribute in the `new_attrs` dictionary with the one from the current class.

To fix this bug, we should merge the `fields` attribute from the base classes with the `fields` attribute from the current class. This can be done by updating the `fields` dictionary with the `fields` attribute from the base classes first, and then adding the attributes from the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    for base in new_bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected function first updates the `fields` dictionary with the `fields` attribute from the base classes, and then adds the attributes from the current class. This fixes the bug where the `fields` attribute was being overridden instead of merged.
