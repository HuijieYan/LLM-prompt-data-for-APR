The potential error in the provided code is that the function is attempting to create a new instance of the ItemMeta class using the same function `__new__`, which can lead to an infinite recursion error.

The reason for the bug is that the code is not correctly creating a new class instance based on the input parameters and it is also trying to access the `Field` class without its definition in the provided code.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should be updated to use the `super()` function to call the parent class's `__new__` method and create a new instance of the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
