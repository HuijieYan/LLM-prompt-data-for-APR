The error message indicates that the `D.fields` dictionary does not match the expected value. This discrepancy indicates that the `fields` dictionary is not properly constructed in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class.

The error appears to be related to the way the `fields` dictionary is being constructed in the `__new__` method. It seems like the `fields` dictionary is not being updated correctly in the buggy function, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should correctly construct the `fields` dictionary and update the `new_attrs` dictionary with the correct attributes. It seems like the code is iterating over the `_class` attributes and trying to identify the `Field` instances, but it's not updating the `new_attrs` and `fields` dictionaries properly.

The corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class should be:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected function, we properly iterate over the `_class` attributes, identify `Field` instances, update the `fields` dictionary, and update the `new_attrs` dictionary with the correct attributes. This should address the issue and ensure that the `D.fields` dictionary will match the expected value in the test case.
