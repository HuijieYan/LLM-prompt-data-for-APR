The bug in the provided function is that it overrides the 'fields' instead of merging it when creating a new class with updated attributes. This is causing issues when inheriting from the Item class.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to merge the 'fields' from the parent class with the 'fields' from the current class, instead of overriding it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
``` 

In the corrected function, we first merge the 'fields' from the base classes using the 'update' method to ensure that the fields are combined. Then we iterate through the attributes of the new class, and if the attribute is a Field, we add it to the 'fields' dictionary. Lastly, we update the 'fields' in the new_attrs and return the new class with the updated attributes.
