The problem with the current implementation is that it overrides the `fields` dictionary in `attrs` instead of merging it with the `fields` from the `_class`. This is causing issues when trying to access the `fields` attribute later on.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the implementation to merge the `fields` dictionary from `_class` with the `fields` dictionary from `attrs` instead of overwriting it.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    fields.update(attrs.get('fields', {}))  # Merge fields from the attrs with the _class fields
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this modification, the `fields` dictionary from `attrs` is merged with the `fields` dictionary from `_class`, preventing it from being overridden. This should resolve the issue of overriding fields instead of merging them.
