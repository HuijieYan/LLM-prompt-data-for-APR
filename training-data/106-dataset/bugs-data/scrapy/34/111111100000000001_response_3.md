Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring when the function tries to create a new instance of the class using the `super()` method.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function is incorrectly using `super()` to initialize the class, resulting in an infinite loop of calling `__new__` function of the metaclass.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Instead of calling `super().__new__`, we can call the `__new__` method of the base metaclass, which would be `type`. We also need to modify the logic for creating the new class and its attributes.

Corrected code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = type('x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    new_attrs = {n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if n in fields or n in bases}

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
