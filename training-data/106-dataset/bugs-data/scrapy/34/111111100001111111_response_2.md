The bug occurs in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The function is supposed to merge the fields of the class with the fields of its base classes, but it is incorrectly overriding the fields instead.

The bug occurs because in the buggy function, the `new_attrs` dictionary is being created before the base classes' fields are merged. This leads to the fields of the current class overriding the fields of the base classes.

To fix this bug, the `new_attrs` dictionary should be updated to merge the fields of the current class with the fields of its base classes before it is returned.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            for field_name, field_value in base.fields.items():
                fields.setdefault(field_name, field_value)
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected code, the fields from the current class will be merged with the fields from its base classes before being returned, fixing the bug where the fields were being overridden instead of merged.
