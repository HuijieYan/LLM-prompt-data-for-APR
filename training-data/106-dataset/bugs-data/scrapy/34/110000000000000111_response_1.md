The potential error in the given code is at the line where the new class is created using `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. This code is trying to create a new class with new attributes, but it is not merging the fields from the base class with the new fields.

The bug occurs because the original code is not properly merging the fields from the base class with the new fields. As a result, when the new class is created, it only contains the new fields without the fields from the base class.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to properly merge the fields from the base class with the new fields. We can do this by updating the `new_attrs` dictionary with the fields from the base class before creating the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    fields = {}
    
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code:
- We create a new `fields` dictionary and loop through the `bases` to merge their fields into the `fields` dictionary.
- We then loop through the `attrs` and add the new fields to the `fields` dictionary, and add other attributes to `new_attrs` dictionary.
- Finally, we update `new_attrs` with the merged `fields` dictionary and create the new class with the updated attributes.
