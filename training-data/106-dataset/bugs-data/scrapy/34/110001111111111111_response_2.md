The bug is in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The issue is that the `new_attrs` dictionary is not correctly merged with the existing attributes when a new class is created.

The reason for the bug is that the `__new__` method is overwriting the `fields` attribute in the new class instead of merging it with the existing `fields` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to correctly merge the `fields` attribute with the existing attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            new_attrs.update(base.fields)
    new_attrs.update(attrs)
    new_attrs['_class'] = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
    
    fields = {k: v for k, v in new_attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `fields` attribute is correctly merged with the existing attributes when a new class is created. This should resolve the error in the test case and ensure that the `fields` are properly inherited and merged in the new class.
