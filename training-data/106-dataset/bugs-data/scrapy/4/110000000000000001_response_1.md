Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the cb_wrapper function where it is catching an exception but not doing anything with it.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The cb_wrapper function is catching exceptions when executing the callback function, but it is not handling these exceptions or doing anything else with them, so they are being silently ignored.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Handle the exceptions caught in the cb_wrapper function and add the appropriate error information to the results.

Corrected code:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:  # Handle the exception
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the exception in the cb_wrapper function is explicitly handled using a try-except block. When an exception occurs, it is added to the results using the addError method.
