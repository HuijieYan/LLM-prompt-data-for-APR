The error message points to the "eb_wrapper" function, specifically the line within it that sets the "exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__". This suggests that the "exc_value" object may be a part of a traceback chain and its "exc_value.__cause__" attribute might be pointing to a system-specific object that doesn't have a "__traceback__" attribute.

The bug occurs because the "exc_value" object's "__cause__" attribute points to a system-specific object that doesn't have a "__traceback__" attribute. This leads to an AttributeError when the code tries to access the "__traceback__" attribute, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where "exc_value.__cause__" might not have a "__traceback__" attribute. We can modify the "eb_wrapper" function to check if "exc_value" has a "__cause__" attribute, and if it does, then check if that attribute has a "__traceback__" attribute before using it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if failure.check(HttpError):
            exc_info = failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
        else:
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code:
- We wrap the error handling code in the "eb_wrapper" function in an `if` statement to handle the case where "exc_value.__cause__" might not have a "__traceback__" attribute. If the failure is of type HttpError, we use the "failure.value", "type(failure.value)", and "failure.getTracebackObject()" to create the "exc_info". Otherwise, we use "sys.exc_info()" to get the exception info.

With this modification, the AttributeError should no longer occur, and the "eb_wrapper" function should handle the failure properly regardless of the structure of the traceback chain.
