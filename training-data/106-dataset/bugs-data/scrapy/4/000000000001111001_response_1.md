The potential error in the given code is that the `eb_wrapper` function is not being assigned to the `request.errback` properly. This could be the reason why the `request.errback` value has a different type and address compared to the expected value.

To fix this issue, the `eb_wrapper` function should be directly assigned to the `request.errback`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

# this is the corrected function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:  # Specify the exception type
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (e, e.__class__, e.__traceback__))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper  # Assign eb_wrapper directly to request.errback
```

With this corrected code, the `eb_wrapper` function will be correctly assigned to `request.errback`. This should resolve the issue of the unexpected type and address for `request.errback` in the test case.
