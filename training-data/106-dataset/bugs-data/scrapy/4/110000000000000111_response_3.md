The error is occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method. The error is related to the way the `exc_info` is being handled. The `exc_info` is being passed as a tuple which includes the exception type, exception value, and traceback object. However, it seems like the `exc_info` is not being handled correctly in the `results.addError` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure the `exc_info` is being passed correctly to the `results.addError` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            exc_info = sys.exc_info()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, I've fixed the handling of `exc_info` in both the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions to ensure it is passed correctly to the `results.addError` method. This should resolve the `AttributeError` from the `eb_wrapper` function.
