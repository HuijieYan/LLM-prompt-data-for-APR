The error message indicates an AttributeError occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `ContractsManager` class, specifically in the line `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__`. This suggests that the `exc_value` object does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError. The reason for this bug may be due to how the `exc_info` is being handled in the `eb_wrapper` function.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the `exc_info` properly. Instead of directly accessing `exc_info` attributes, the `exc_value` should be extracted from `exc_info` and then the necessary attributes should be accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function within the `ContractsManager` class:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    
    # ... other functions ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = failure.getTracebackObject()
            exc_info = (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, `exc_type`, `exc_value`, and `exc_traceback` are extracted from `failure` using `getTracebackObject()`, and then used to construct `exc_info`. This ensures that the correct attributes are accessed, addressing the AttributeError issue.
