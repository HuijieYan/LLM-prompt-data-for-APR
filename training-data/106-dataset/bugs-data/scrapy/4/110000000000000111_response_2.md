Potential Error Location:
The error appears to be occurring in the `eb_wrapper` method, where `results.addError` is being called with `exc_info` as the parameter. This `exc_info` seems to be causing an AttributeError because it might be expecting a different format or structure of the input.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `exc_info` parameter being passed to `results.addError` in the `eb_wrapper` method is not in the expected format or structure. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the traceback object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the format and structure of the `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` in the `eb_wrapper` method.
2. Ensure that the traceback object is being passed correctly as part of the `exc_info`.
3. Handle any exceptions or errors related to the format of `exc_info` being passed.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
In the above corrected code, I have made the following changes:
1. Added a return statement in the `cb_wrapper` to ensure that the output is returned after processing.
2. Enclosed the `exception` type in the `cb_wrapper` within a specific `Exception` class to capture all types of exceptions and added it to the `results.addError`.
3. Wrapped `failure.value`, `failure.type`, and `failure.getTracebackObject()` within a tuple to ensure correct formatting for `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` in the `eb_wrapper`.
