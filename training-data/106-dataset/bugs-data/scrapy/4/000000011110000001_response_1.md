The error message `AttributeError: 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__'` is likely caused by an issue in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` function. The error occurs when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__` which is not defined.

This bug occurs because the `exc_value` being passed to `eb_wrapper` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute. This is likely due to incorrect exception handling or passing of the exception object.

To fix this issue, the exception handling in the `eb_wrapper` should be updated and the correct attributes should be accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output
        except Exception as e:  # Catch specific exception if possible
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
            return None  # Return a value to prevent potential NoneType error

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `cb_wrapper`, the specific exceptions are caught and handled. Additionally, a return value is added to prevent potential NoneType errors. In the `eb_wrapper`, the correct attributes of the `failure` object are accessed and passed to `results.addError`.
