It seems that the bug is occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `exc_info`. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the `exc_info` is being handled.

Looking at the `eb_wrapper` function, the `exc_info` is being passed to the `results.addError` method. This method call seems to be incorrect and might be causing the `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, the `exc_info` should be passed to `results.addError` in a correct format. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    
    cb = request.callback

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In this corrected code, the `exc_info` is formatted correctly using a tuple and then passed to the `results.addError` method. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue.
