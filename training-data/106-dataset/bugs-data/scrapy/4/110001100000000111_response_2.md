The error 'AttributeError: 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__' is occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function because of the way `exc_info` is being handled. It seems that `exc_info` is being passed incorrectly, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the `exc_info` correctly in the `eb_wrapper` function and pass it to the `results.addError` function in the right format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTraceback())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, `exc_info` in the `eb_wrapper` function is created in the correct format using the `failure.value`, `failure.type`, and `failure.getTraceback()`.

This should fix the AttributeError issue related to the contract errback.
