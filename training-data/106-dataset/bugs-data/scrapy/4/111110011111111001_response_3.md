The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurred due to an `AttributeError`. It seems to be related to accessing the `__traceback__` attribute, but the root cause is not apparent from this error message alone.

The potential error location within the function is the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically where the `exc_info` is captured to be passed to `results.addError(case, exc_info)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be related to the way the `exc_info` is being collected or processed. It's possible that the code is trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute on an object that does not have it, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `exc_info` is captured correctly, possibly by modifying the way it is collected or processed. Additionally, we should handle the case where the `__traceback__` attribute is not available to avoid the `AttributeError`.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys
from unittest.runner import TextTestResult
from scrapy.contracts import HttpError, failure
from scrapy import Request

class ContractsManager(object):
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):

        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = request.callback(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = f'_create_testcase(method, "callback")'
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = f'_create_testcase({method}, "errback")'
            exc_type = type(failure.value)
            exc_value = failure.value
            exc_traceback = failure.getTracebackObject()
            try:
                exc_traceback = exc_value.__traceback__
            except AttributeError:
                exc_traceback = None
            exc_info = (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the provided code, I made the following updates:
1. Modified the way `exc_info` is collected in the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the case where `__traceback__` attribute is not available.
2. Used a try-except block to handle the AttributeError when accessing the `__traceback__` attribute.
3. Updated the signature of the `eb_wrapper` function to capture `failure` properly and then obtain the `exc_info` attributes.
