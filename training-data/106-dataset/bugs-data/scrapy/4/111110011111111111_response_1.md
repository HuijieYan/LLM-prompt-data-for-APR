The error occurs at line 88 in the eb_wrapper function. The error message suggests that the 'getset_descriptor' object does not have the attribute '__traceback__'.

This error occurs because the exception object being passed to the addError method does not contain the necessary traceback attribute. This could be due to the way the exception is being handled or constructed.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the exception object being passed to the addError method contains a valid traceback attribute. This may involve modifying the way exceptions are handled or creating custom exception objects with the necessary attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ Stop the request from returning objects and record any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
