Analysis:
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the `__traceback__` attribute. This attribute is accessed in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method. The cause of the AttributeError may be related to the exception handling when calling `request.errback(failure_mock)`.

Reasons:
The AttributeError is occurring because the `failure` object does not have the `__traceback__` attribute, which is being accessed within the `eb_wrapper` function. This indicates that the `failure` object is not handling the exception correctly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type and attributes of the `failure` object being passed to `request.errback`.
2. Ensure that the `failure` object contains the necessary traceback information or modify the code to handle exceptions without relying on the `failure` object's attributes directly.

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
In the corrected code, the modification is made in the `eb_wrapper` function. The `exc_info` is constructed using the `failure` object's attributes, and `failure.getTracebackObject()` is used to obtain the traceback object. This approach ensures that the necessary traceback information is included in the `exc_info`.
