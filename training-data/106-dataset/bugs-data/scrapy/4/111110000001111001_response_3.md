The buggy function `_clean_req` is intended to handle the callback and errback functions for a request. However, the current implementation does not correctly assign the wrapper functions to the request's callback and errback. This is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual values for the variables `request.errback` and `eb_wrapper`.

To fix the bug, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions should be defined within the `_clean_req` function and then assigned to the request's callback and errback, respectively.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from functools import wraps

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
        
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

This corrected code defines the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions inside the `_clean_req` function and then assigns them to the request's callback and errback, respectively. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect assignment of wrapper functions and ensure that the expected values match the actual values in the provided test case.
