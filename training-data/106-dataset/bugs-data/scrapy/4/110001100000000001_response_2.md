Potential error location: The issue is likely with the try-except block within the cb_wrapper function. If an exception occurs, the code will catch the exception but does not re-raise it, causing the error to be swallowed and not properly handled.

Reason for the bug: The bug arises because the exception is caught but not re-raised, so it is not properly handled and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Approach to fixing the bug: Instead of catching the exception and only adding it to the results, the code should re-raise the exception after adding it to the results. This will ensure that the exception is properly handled and propagated.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def _create_testcase(method, desc):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def cb_wrapper(response, method, results):
    def wrapper(cb):
        @wraps(cb)
        def wrapped(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
                raise
        return wrapped
    return wrapper

def eb_wrapper(failure, method, results):
    case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
    exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
    results.addError(case, exc_info)

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback
    request.callback = cb_wrapper(request.callback, method, results)
    request.callback.__wrapped__ = cb  # store original callback as __wrapped__ attribute

    request.errback = eb_wrapper(request.errback, method, results)
``` 

In the corrected code, the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions are modified to properly handle exceptions by re-raising them after adding to the results. The _clean_req function is also updated to properly assign the callback and errback functions.
