The error is likely due to the attribute `__traceback__` being accessed on an object that does not have this attribute. This can occur when using the `exc_info` tuple incorrectly.

It seems that the `eb_wrapper` function is not properly handling the `exc_info` tuple when adding an error to the results. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `exc_info` tuple is used correctly to add an error to the results.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, exc_info=sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info=exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `cb_wrapper` function, we use `results.addError(case, exc_info=sys.exc_info())` to properly add the error information to the results.

In the `eb_wrapper` function, we use `results.addError(case, exc_info=exc_info)` to properly add the error information to the results.

These changes should ensure that the `exc_info` tuple is used correctly and the error associated with the AttributeError from the contract errback should be resolved.
