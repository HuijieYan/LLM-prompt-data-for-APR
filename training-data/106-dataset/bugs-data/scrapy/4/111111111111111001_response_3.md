The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to the use of `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__` in the `TracebackException` class. This suggests that the `exc_value.__cause__` attribute does not have a `__traceback__` attribute.

The potential error location within the code is the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically when creating the `TracebackException` object using `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc_value.__cause__` attribute does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to handle the `exc_value.__cause__` attribute more carefully and check if it has a `__traceback__` attribute before accessing it.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function fixed
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if failure.__cause__ and hasattr(failure.__cause__, '__traceback__'):
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.__cause__.__traceback__
        else:
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, None
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, a check is added to verify if `failure.__cause__` exists and if it has a `__traceback__` attribute. If it does, `failure.__cause__.__traceback__` is used; otherwise, it is set to `None`. This ensures that the AttributeError is avoided and the code works as intended.
