The error occurs when the `eb_wrapper` function is called from the `request.errback` method in the `test_errback` test function. The error message indicates that the `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__` attribute is causing an AttributeError. This suggests that the `exc_value` object does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, which is being accessed in the `eb_wrapper` function.

The potential error location is within the `eb_wrapper` function in the `_clean_req` method. When the `results.addError` method is called in the `eb_wrapper` function, it tries to access `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__`, which causes an AttributeError when `exc_value` does not have the `__traceback__` attribute. This occurs when a non-200 response is encountered.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the cases where `exc_value` does not have the `__traceback__` attribute. We also need to make sure that proper exception handling is in place to prevent the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    if hasattr(request, 'callback'):
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
    if hasattr(request, 'errback'):
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, we have added proper exception handling in the `cb_wrapper` function using a generic `except Exception as e` block, and we have added checks to ensure that `request.callback` and `request.errback` exist before assigning them to the wrapper functions. This should prevent the AttributeError and handle non-200 responses properly.
