Based on the error message from the test function, the AttributeError is thrown at line 89 of the `_clean_req` function due to `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__`. This indicates that the `exc_value` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value` without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to handle the situation where `exc_value` doesn't have a `__traceback__` attribute. Additionally, the `except` block in the `cb_wrapper` function should re-raise the exception to avoid swallowing it unintentionally.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps
from twisted.python import failure

def _create_testcase(method, desc):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
                # Re-raise the exception here
                raise

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, getattr(failure, 'getTracebackObject', lambda: None)()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the `eb_wrapper` function now handles the situation where `failure` does not have a `getTracebackObject` attribute, and the `cb_wrapper` function re-raises the exception after adding an error to the `results`.

With these changes, the AttributeError should be resolved and the function should handle exceptions properly.
