The bug occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically in the following line of code:

`exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()`

This line of code is trying to access the traceback object using `failure.getTracebackObject()`. However, the AttributeError is raised because the `getTracebackObject()` method does not exist or is not accessible on the `failure` object.

To fix this bug, we can use Twisted's `extract_tb` function to get the traceback object from the failure. Additionally, we need to modify the line where `exc_info` is assigned, as it should be a tuple with the error information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys
import traceback

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, traceback.extract_tb(failure.getTracebackObject()))
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With these modifications, the AttributeError issue should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
