The error message indicates an AttributeError occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function. The issue seems to be related to accessing the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__` in the `TracebackException` instantiation.

The bug is likely occurring because the `exc_value.__cause__` object is not guaranteed to have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError. This suggests that the `exc_value.__cause__` may not be a standard exception object or might be lacking the `__traceback__` attribute.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the `exc_value` and `failure` object more robustly, ensuring that the `__traceback__` attribute is accessed only if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if hasattr(failure, 'getTracebackObject'):
            exc_info = failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject()
        else:
            exc_info = failure.value, type(failure.value), sys.exc_info()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check whether the `failure` object has a `getTracebackObject` attribute before accessing it. If the attribute exists, it can be safely used; otherwise, we resort to using `sys.exc_info()` to capture the exception information. This approach ensures that the code handles various types of `failure` objects more robustly and avoids unnecessary attribute errors.
