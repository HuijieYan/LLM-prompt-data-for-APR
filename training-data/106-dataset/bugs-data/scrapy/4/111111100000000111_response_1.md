The issue seems to be related to the handling of errors in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class. When a non-200 response is received, the `eb_wrapper` function is called to add an error to the results, but it seems to be handling the exception incorrectly, leading to an AttributeError.

The bug is likely occurring because the `add_error` method is being called with incorrect arguments, possibly due to the way the exception information is being retrieved and passed.

To fix the bug, the `eb_wrapper` function should be modified to correctly handle the exception and to make sure the correct information is passed to the `add_error` method. Additionally, it's important to handle the exception properly to avoid AttributeError.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            failure.printTraceback()  # print the failure traceback for debugging
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, I added a `failure.printTraceback()` line to print the failure traceback for debugging purposes. This line is only for debugging and should be removed for production code. Additionally, I modified the `exc_info` assignment to correctly capture the exception information and pass it to the `addError` method.

This should address the AttributeError issue and correctly handle the exceptions. However, it's important to thoroughly test the fixed code to ensure it behaves as expected.
