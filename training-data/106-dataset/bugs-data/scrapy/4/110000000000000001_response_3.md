The potential error in the provided code is in the `cb_wrapper` function. If an error occurs in the `cb` function, it is caught but not re-raised, so the request will not be properly handled. Additionally, the `@wraps(cb)` decorator is unnecessary and can be removed.

The function is designed to wrap the callback and errback functions of a request, but it does not properly handle errors or return values.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a `return output` statement after catching the error in the `cb_wrapper` function so that the original output is returned.
2. Add a `raise` statement after catching the error in the `cb_wrapper` function so that the error gets properly raised and handled by the errback function.
3. Ensure that the `exc_info` value for the `addError` function in the `eb_wrapper` function is properly constructed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output  # add a return statement to return the original output
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
            raise  # re-raise the exception to be handled by the errback function

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())  # construct the exc_info tuple properly
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
