The error occurs when the `eb_wrapper` function is called with the `failure` argument, and it tries to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`, which results in an AttributeError.

The reason behind the bug is that the `exc_infos` tuple passed to `results.addError` in `eb_wrapper` contains `failure.value`, which is causing the AttributeError when further accessing the traceback.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the creation of `exc_info` correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())  # Now creating the exc_info tuple correctly
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With these changes, the `exc_info` tuple is created using `(failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())`, which resolves the AttributeError issue. The corrected code should now handle the exception correctly and avoid the error mentioned.
