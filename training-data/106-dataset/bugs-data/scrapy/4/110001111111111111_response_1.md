The error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function when it tries to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`. It seems that `exc_value.__cause__` is a `getset_descriptor` object, which does not have the `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the `except` block within the `cb_wrapper` function needs to capture all exceptions and not just the generic `except:`. Additionally, the `eb_wrapper` function can be modified to handle the `__traceback__` attribute more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:  # Capture all exceptions
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (type(e), e, e.__traceback__))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if hasattr(failure.value, '__traceback__'):
            exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, failure.value.__traceback__)
        else:
            exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, None)
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With these changes, the error handling is more robust, and the AttributeError should be handled more gracefully. The `eb_wrapper` function now checks for the existence of `__traceback__` attribute and sets the `exc_info` tuple accordingly.
