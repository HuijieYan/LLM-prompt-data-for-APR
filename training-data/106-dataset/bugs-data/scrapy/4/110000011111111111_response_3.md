The issue is likely occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with accessing the '__traceback__' attribute of an exception in this function, specifically at the line:
```
exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__,
```

The error message indicates an 'AttributeError: 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__''. This implies that `exc_value.__cause__` is a 'getset_descriptor' object, which does not have a '__traceback__' attribute. This is likely causing the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to handle exceptions and their causes properly to ensure the '__traceback__' attribute is accessible. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct exception and traceback objects are being passed to the `results.addError` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clean_req` method:

```python
# corrected function
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output  # Add a return statement here
        except Exception as e:  # Catch specific exception types
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected version of the `cb_wrapper` function, a return statement is added to ensure that output is returned. An exception is caught and handled. Additionally, in the `eb_wrapper` function, the `exc_info` is updated to properly handle the failure.

These changes should address the AttributeError issue and ensure that the method functions as expected.
