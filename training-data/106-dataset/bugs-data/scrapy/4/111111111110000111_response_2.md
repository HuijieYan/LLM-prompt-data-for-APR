The test function tests the behavior of the `eb_wrapper` method when calling the `request.errback` method. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` occurring in the `eb_wrapper` method, specifically when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value.__cause__` object.

The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the `exc_info` tuple, which results in trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value.__cause__` object, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `eb_wrapper` method needs to properly handle the `exc_info` tuple, specifically the `exc_value` and `exc_traceback`. Additionally, the `cb_wrapper` method can be modified to properly re-raise any exceptions that occur during the callback execution.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
                raise  # Re-raise the exception after handling it

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `cb_wrapper` method, the `except` block has been modified to properly handle and log the error and then re-raise the exception. In the `eb_wrapper` method, the `exc_info` tuple is properly constructed using the `type(failure.value)`, `failure.value`, and `failure.getTracebackObject()`.

These changes ensure that exceptions are properly handled and logged in the contract manager.
