The error message provided indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value.__cause__` object. This error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function while attempting to add an error to the results. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `eb_wrapper` function. In this function, when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`, it is resulting in an `AttributeError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc_value.__cause__` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute. This is likely causing the AttributeError during the traceback processing.

To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `exc_value.__cause__` might not have a `__traceback__` attribute. We can use a conditional check to ensure that this attribute exists before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if failure.__cause__ and hasattr(failure.__cause__, '__traceback__'):
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
        else:
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, we added a conditional check to verify if `failure.__cause__` exists and whether it has a `__traceback__` attribute. Depending on the result of this check, the appropriate handling of the error information is performed. This should address the AttributeError during the traceback processing.
