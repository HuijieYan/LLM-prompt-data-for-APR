The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the assignment of the cb and eb wrappers to the request's callback and errback attributes.

Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the assignment of the cb and eb wrappers to request.callback and request.errback.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. The function `_clean_req` attempts to assign local functions `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` as callback and errback functions for the `request`.
2. However, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are nested within the `_clean_req` function and are not being returned or used outside of `_clean_req`.
3. This means that the assignment to `request.callback` and `request.errback` is not actually making use of the decorators defined inside `_clean_req`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the wrapper functions `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` from inside the `_clean_req` function and define them as separate methods of the `ContractsManager` class.
2. Use these separate methods to assign as callback and errback functions for the `request`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def cb_wrapper(self, request, response, results, method):
        try:
            output = request.callback(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
    def eb_wrapper(self, request, failure, results, method):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        request.callback = wraps(request.callback)(self.cb_wrapper)
        request.errback = wraps(request.errback)(self.eb_wrapper)
```

In this corrected code, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` have been defined as separate methods of the `ContractsManager` class. Inside the `_clean_req` method, the assignment to `request.callback` and `request.errback` now uses the correct class methods for wrapping the callback and error handling logic.
