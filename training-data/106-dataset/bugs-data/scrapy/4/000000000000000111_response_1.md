The bug seems to be related to the `eb_wrapper` function inside the `_clean_req` method. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` raised within the `eb_wrapper` function when `results.addError` is called.

The reason for the bug could be that the `failure` object does not have the expected attributes or methods that are being accessed within the `eb_wrapper` function.

To fix this bug, we can update the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the failure and extract the necessary information from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

# this is the corrected function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (e, sys.exc_info()[2]))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `cb_wrapper`, we catch any exception and include the exception details when adding an error to the results. In the `eb_wrapper`, we construct the `exc_info` tuple from the `failure` object. These changes should address the `AttributeError` issue and provide more accurate error handling.
