The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__` in the `eb_wrapper` function. This suggests that the `exc_value` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically in the handling of the `exc_info` and `failure` objects.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc_info` and `failure` objects are not being handled correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `exc_info` and `failure` objects need to be properly handled in the `eb_wrapper` function to ensure that the `__traceback__` attribute exists before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        if hasattr(failure.value, '__traceback__'):
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.value.__traceback__)
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

This corrected code includes a check for the `__traceback__` attribute in the `eb_wrapper` function to ensure that it exists before accessing it. If the attribute exists, it is used in the `exc_info` tuple; otherwise, the original `failure.value.__traceback__` attribute is used.
