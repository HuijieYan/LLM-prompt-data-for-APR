The potential error in the `_clean_req` function is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not accessible within the scope of the `_clean_req` function. They are defined within the class `ContractsManager`, but the `_clean_req` function is not able to directly access them.

To fix the bug, you can move the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions outside of the `ContractsManager` class and make them accessible to the `_clean_req` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


# signature of a relative function in this class
def cb_wrapper(response):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# signature of a relative function in this class
def eb_wrapper(failure):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapped(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapped(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapped
    request.errback = eb_wrapped
```

In the corrected code, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions have been moved outside the `ContractsManager` class and renamed to `cb_wrapped` and `eb_wrapped` to avoid conflicts. These functions are now accessible within the scope of the `_clean_req` function.
