The potential error in the `_clean_req` method is that it is trying to wrap the `request.callback` function with `cb_wrapper`, but if an exception occurs within the `cb_wrapper`, it is not handled properly. Additionally, the `eb_wrapper` is defined within the `_clean_req` method but is not being utilized. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that if an exception occurs within the `cb_wrapper` when calling `cb(response)`, the exception is caught but not handled. Similarly, the `eb_wrapper` is defined but not bound to the `request.errback`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the exception within the `cb_wrapper` and bind the `eb_wrapper` to the `request.errback`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                cb = request.callback
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.addCallback(cb_wrapper)
        request.addErrback(eb_wrapper)
```

In the corrected code, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are defined within the `_clean_req` method and are properly used to handle the callback and errback. The exceptions within the `cb_wrapper` are now caught and properly handled by adding error cases to the `results`. Additionally, the `request` now utilizes `addCallback` and `addErrback` to bind the callback and errback functions.
