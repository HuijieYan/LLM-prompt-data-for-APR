Potential error location: The cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions are not being properly defined within the _clean_req method. It seems like the intention is to define these functions within the _clean_req method, but the code does not do so effectively.

Reason for the bug: The cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions are defined as separate functions outside of the _clean_req method, causing the code to not behave as intended. Additionally, the @wraps(cb) decorator is used incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions within the _clean_req method, so that they are properly encapsulated within the method.
2. Use a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur within the cb_wrapper function, rather than having the except block outside of the function definition.
3. Correct the usage of the @wraps(cb) decorator to properly wrap the original callback function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = request.callback(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
