The provided test case tests the response of a `GET` request to `/model` endpoint. The response is expected to have a JSON body containing `name`, `description`, and `model_b` fields. The problem occurs because the `model_b` field has more attributes in the response JSON than expected. The attributes present are `username` and `password`, while only `username` is expected.

The issue in the `create_cloned_field` function might be related to the cloning and manipulation of the fields of the `ModelField` instance. It appears that the `create_cloned_field` is not properly handling the sub-model `model_b`. This may be causing the additional attributes to be present in the response JSON.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review and update the logic within the `create_cloned_field` function to ensure that the sub-models and their fields are properly cloned without adding or modifying any extra fields.

The corrected `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=field.field_info,
        schema=field.schema
    )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.validate_always = field.validate_always
    new_field.allow_none = field.allow_none
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    new_field.pre_validators = field.pre_validators
    new_field.post_validators = field.post_validators
    new_field.shape = field.shape
    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [
            create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
        ]
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
    return new_field
```

In the corrected function, the creation of the cloned field instance and handling of sub-models and their fields are simplified to ensure that unnecessary additions or modifications are avoided.
