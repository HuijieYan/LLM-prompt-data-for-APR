The error seems to be due to the incorrect creation of a cloned field in the `create_cloned_field` method. The function currently does not create a true clone of the original field as expected, which results in discrepancies when comparing the JSON response in the test function.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not appropriately handling the field type and model attributes during the cloning process. It's not creating a true clone that matches the original field's attributes and type.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to create a proper clone of the original field, including type, attributes, and other necessary configurations.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` method:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    # Create a new field by deep copying the original field
    new_field = copy.deepcopy(field)
    return new_field
```

In the corrected code, we're using the `copy.deepcopy` method to create a true clone of the original field. This ensures that all attributes, type, and configurations are properly copied to the new field, addressing the issue with the original buggy code.
