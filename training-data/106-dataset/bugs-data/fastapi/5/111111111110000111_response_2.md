The error is occurring because the function `create_cloned_field` is not correctly creating cloned fields according to the specified response model. This results in the test failing to assert the expected and actual response JSONs.

The bug is most likely happening in the section of the function where the new cloned field is created. It seems that the cloned field is not being properly created to match the response model, leading to additional data being present in the response.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the cloned field is created according to the specified response model. This involves properly copying the attributes from the original field to the new field and ensuring that only the attributes defined in the response model are included in the new field.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass  # ensure to remove this line

    # corrected implementation
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=field.field_info if PYDANTIC_1 else field.schema
    )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.allow_none = field.allow_none
    new_field.validate_always = field.validate_always
    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields]
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    if PYDANTIC_1:
        new_field.pre_validators = field.pre_validators
        new_field.post_validators = field.post_validators
    else:
        new_field.whole_pre_validators = field.whole_pre_validators
        new_field.whole_post_validators = field.whole_post_validators
    new_field.parse_json = field.parse_json
    new_field.shape = field.shape
    try:
        new_field.populate_validators()
    except AttributeError:
        new_field._populate_validators()  # for handling Pydantic < 1.0.0 support

    return new_field
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should properly create the cloned field according to the specified response model, ensuring that additional data is filtered out as expected.
