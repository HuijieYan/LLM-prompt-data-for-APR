The provided function seems to be related to the bug where the response model does not filter out additional data for nested models. The bug is visible in the `create_cloned_field` function, where attributes of the `field` are not correctly processed according to the response model schema. The bug causes the nested model attributes not to be filtered as expected.

The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of attributes within the `create_cloned_field` function. The function fails to properly process and filter out the nested model attributes according to the specified response model.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to be corrected to ensure that it correctly clones the provided field, including any nested model attributes, and filters them according to the response model schema.

Below is the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    use_type = field.type_
    
    cloned_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
    )
    
    cloned_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    cloned_field.alias = field.alias
    cloned_field.allow_none = field.allow_none
    cloned_field.validate_always = field.validate_always
    cloned_field.validators = field.validators

    # Create cloned fields for sub_fields
    if field.sub_fields:
        cloned_field.sub_fields = [
            create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
        ]

    # Create cloned field for key_field
    if field.key_field:
        cloned_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)

    return cloned_field
```

The corrected code properly handles the cloning of the field and retains nested model attributes according to the specified response model. This should ensure that the response model filters out additional data for nested models as expected.
