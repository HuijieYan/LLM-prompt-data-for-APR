The error is caused by the `create_cloned_field` function in the `utils.py` file. The function is supposed to create a cloned field but it's not handling nested models properly, leading to issues where the response model is not being filtered as expected.

The error occurs because the function is not correctly handling nested models. It fails to correctly create a cloned field for nested models, leading to issues with response model filtering.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to be updated to correctly handle nested models and ensure that the response model is filtered as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.main import BaseModel
from pydantic.types import Type

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    if hasattr(field.type_, "__fields__"):
        fields = {}
        for name, sub_field in field.type_.__fields__.items():
            fields[name] = create_cloned_field(sub_field)
        return ModelField(
            name=field.name,
            type_=field.type_,
            required=field.required,
            model_config=field.model_config,
            default=field.default,
            alias=field.alias,
            class_validators=field.class_validators,
            field_info=field.field_info,
            schema=field.schema,
            sub_fields=fields,
            key_field=create_cloned_field(field.key_field) if field.key_field else None,
            validators=field.validators
        )
    else:
        return field
```

This updated function checks if the field type has fields, if it does, it creates a cloned field for each sub-field and then constructs a new `ModelField` with the sub-fields.

With this correction, the `create_cloned_field` function should now handle nested models correctly and ensure that the response model is filtered as expected.
