Based on the given information and the error message from the test function, it seems that the issue is related to how the response data is being filtered based on the specified response_model. The bug is likely occurring in the create_cloned_field function, which is responsible for creating a cloned field based on the input ModelField.

The bug appears to stem from how the function handles the use_type and original_type variables, as well as the new_field creation. The function needs to properly handle the connection between these variables and ensure that the cloning process is performed correctly.

To fix the bug, consider the following approaches:
1. Ensure that the original_type and use_type variables are used properly to create the new_field with the correct type and configuration.
2. Verify that the field attributes such as has_alias, alias, class_validators, required, model_config, field_info, etc., are correctly transferred to the new_field.
3. Check if the populate_validators method is correctly executed for the new_field.

Here is the corrected code for the create_cloned_field function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, FieldInfo, Field, BaseConfig, ModelField, PYDANTIC_1
from typing import Type, cast

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        original_type = cast(Type[BaseModel], original_type)
        use_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__, __config__=original_type.__config__,
            **original_type.__fields__
        )
    if PYDANTIC_1:
        new_field = ModelField(
            name=field.name,
            type_=use_type,
            class_validators=field.class_validators,
            default=field.default,
            required=field.required,
            model_config=field.model_config,
            field_info=field.field_info,
        )
    else:  # pragma: nocover
        new_field = ModelField(  # type: ignore
            name=field.name,
            type_=use_type,
            class_validators=field.class_validators,
            default=field.default,
            required=field.required,
            model_config=field.model_config,
            schema=FieldInfo(None),
        )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    new_field.parse_json = field.parse_json
    new_field.shape = field.shape
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    if PYDANTIC_1:
        new_field.set_validators(field.validators)
    else:  # pragma: nocover
        new_field.set_validators(field.validators)

    return new_field
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues in the previous implementation by properly creating a new_field with the required attributes and settings.

By making these changes, the create_cloned_field function should now correctly handle the field cloning process, ensuring that the response data is filtered based on the specified response_model.
