Based on the provided variables and the test case, it seems that the issue is related to the Buggy function's inability to properly clone and modify the nested pydantic models. The error is associated with not properly filtering nested model attributes in the response according to the specified `response_model`.

Upon analyzing the code, it is clear that the issue arises from incorrect cloning and modification of the nested pydantic models. The function `create_cloned_field` is unable to appropriately modify and filter the nested model attributes in the response payload.

To fix this bug, the `create_cloned_field` function should be modified to correctly handle nested models and filter the attributes according to the specified `response_model`. This may involve properly handling nesting and filtering of the attributes for the nested models.

Below is the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from types import new_class

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField, response_model: Type[BaseModel]) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    
    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        # Check if the original type is a model
        original_type_name = original_type.__name__
        filtered_fields = response_model.__fields__
        
        # Iterate over the fields of the original model type
        filtered_fields_dict = {field_name: value for field_name, value in original_type.__dict__.items() if field_name in filtered_fields}
        
        # Create a new class using the filtered fields
        new_type = new_class(original_type_name, (BaseModel,), {}, lambda ns: ns.update(filtered_fields_dict))
        use_type = new_type
    else:
        use_type = original_type
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    
    return new_field
```

In this corrected code, the function now properly checks if the original type is a model and filters the fields based on the specified `response_model`. It then creates a new class using the filtered fields and assigns it to `use_type`.

By modifying the `create_cloned_field` function in this way, it should now correctly clone and modify the nested pydantic models and filter the attributes according to the specified `response_model`. This should address the issue of nested model attributes not being properly filtered in the response.
