The test case is comparing the JSON response from an API endpoint with an expected JSON. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the `model_b` key in the JSON response and the expected JSON. The response JSON has an additional key "password" under "model_b" which is not present in the expected JSON.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic where the `create_cloned_field` function handles the cloning of fields and their sub-fields. It seems that during the cloning process, the `create_cloned_field` function is not correctly copying or handling the nested sub-fields of the original field, leading to the unexpected inclusion of the "password" field under "model_b" in the response JSON.

The bug occurred because the function responsible for cloning the fields and sub-fields did not properly handle all the attributes and sub-fields of the original field.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to be modified to accurately clone all attributes and sub-fields of the original field, including the sub-fields of `model_b`.

Below is the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, FieldInfo
from pydantic import BaseModel

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None),
    )
    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields]
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    return new_field
```

This fixed `create_cloned_field` function ensures that all attributes and sub-fields of the original field are accurately cloned, resolving the issue with the unexpected inclusion of the "password" field under "model_b" in the response JSON.
