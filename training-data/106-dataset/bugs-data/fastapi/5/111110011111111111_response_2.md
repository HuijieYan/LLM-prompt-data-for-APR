The issue seems to be related to the filtering of data based on the specified `response_model` in the FastAPI framework when using nested Pydantic models. The expected behavior is that the response data should be filtered according to the specified `response_model`, but this is not happening as expected.

The bug seems to be occurring in the function `create_cloned_field` that is responsible for creating a cloned instance of the `ModelField`. The bug might be causing the response to include additional data that is not declared in the `response_model`.

The root cause of the bug appears to be related to the processing of nested Pydantic models in the `create_cloned_field` function. When creating a new field based on the original field, the new field does not seem to be adhering to the behavior specified by the `response_model`.

To fix this bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to be updated to ensure that the cloned field is properly filtered based on the specified `response_model`. This might involve checking and matching the field attributes with the `response_model` and creating the cloned field accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, FieldInfo, ModelField

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField, response_model: Optional[BaseModel] = None) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(  # Create a new ModelField instance
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        alias=field.alias,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=FieldInfo(...),  # or any specific FieldInfo
    )

    if response_model:
        # Filter new_field attributes based on response_model
        response_attributes = response_model.__annotations__
        original_attributes = new_field.type_.__dict__
        filtered_attributes = {
            attr_name: attr_value
            for attr_name, attr_value in original_attributes.items()
            if attr_name in response_attributes
        }
        new_field.type_ = create_model(  # Update type_ based on response_model
            original_type.__name__,
            **filtered_attributes
        )

    return new_field
```

This updated version of the `create_cloned_field` function includes a check for the specified `response_model`. If a `response_model` is provided, the function filters the attributes of the new field based on the response model, ensuring that the cloned field adheres to the behavior specified by the response model.
