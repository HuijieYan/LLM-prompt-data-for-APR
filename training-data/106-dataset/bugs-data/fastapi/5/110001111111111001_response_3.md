The issue stems from the `create_cloned_field` function not correctly processing the `ModelField` object. Specifically, it seems that the function is failing to properly create a cloned field based on the original field.

The provided code is overly complex and involves various conditionals based on the `PYDANTIC_1` flag, making it challenging to identify the root cause of the issue. It is likely that the conditional statements and the attributes update logic are not handling all cases properly, resulting in incorrect field cloning and data manipulation.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to simplify the logic and update the field cloning process utilizing the properties and methods of the `ModelField` class to ensure the correct instantiation and manipulation of the new field.

Here's a simplified and corrected version of the `create_cloned_field` function based on the analysis:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, FieldInfo, Required, Undefined
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Corrected create_cloned_field function
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = original_type.__class__

    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        default=None,
        required=field.required == Required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=FieldInfo(default=Undefined),
    )
    
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.class_validators = field.class_validators
    new_field.validators = field.validators

    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields]

    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)

    return new_field
```

This corrected function simplifies the logic and correctly utilizes the attributes and methods of the `ModelField` class to create a cloned field. It ensures that type, validation, and structuring information are preserved during the cloning process.

Ensure to test the corrected function with the provided test case to verify its functionality and resolve the original issue.
