Potential error location: 
The bug in the function might be caused by the incorrect handling of the 'original_type' and 'use_type' variables. The code attempts to modify the 'use_type' variable without ensuring that it doesn't affect the original 'original_type' variable, causing unintended side effects.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly reassigns the 'original_type' variable to 'use_type' without maintaining a separate reference for 'use_type'. This leads to modification of the 'original_type' when it should remain unchanged.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Create a new variable to store the modified type instead of modifying the original 'original_type' variable.
2. Ensure that the modifications to the 'original_type' do not affect the subsequent code, and that the correct type is used in each step.

Corrected code:
```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if is_dataclass(original_type) and hasattr(original_type, "__pydantic_model__"):
        use_type = original_type.__pydantic_model__  # type: ignore
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged as it does not contain the error in the original code
    # ...
```
