The test case is related to comparing the response JSON with an expected JSON. The error message shows that the `model_b` field contains additional data that was not asserted. This suggests that the `create_cloned_field` function is failing to filter the additional data.

The potential error location within the `create_cloned_field` function is with the cloning of nested fields.

The bug is occurring because the `create_cloned_field` function is not properly handling nested models. When creating the cloned field, it is not properly filtering out the additional data that is not declared in the output model.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to be modified to properly filter out the additional data for nested models.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, FieldInfo
from pydantic.main import BaseModel

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None),
    )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    new_field.allow_none = field.allow_none
    new_field.validate_always = field.validate_always

    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [
            create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
        ]
    
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
        
    return new_field
```

This corrected function will properly clone the nested fields and filter out additional data for nested models, resolving the issue where additional data was not being filtered.
