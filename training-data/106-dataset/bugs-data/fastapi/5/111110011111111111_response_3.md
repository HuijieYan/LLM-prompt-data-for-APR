Based on the test cases and error messages, it seems that the issue lies in the `create_cloned_field` function. The function is not correctly handling the creation of a new field when the original type is a subclass of `BaseModel`, because it is not checking to see if `original_type` is a subclass of `BaseModel` when replacing `use_type` with a new model created using `create_model`.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly handling subclassed models. When the original type is a subclass of `BaseModel`, the approach the function takes is to create a new model based on the original type's name and configuration. However, it does not consider that `use_type` might already be an instance of a subclassed model, so it replaces it with a new model that only copies the fields, validators, and any pre/post validators of the original type, which is not correct.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `use_type` is a new model only when the original type is not a subclass of `BaseModel`. When it is a subclass of `BaseModel`, we should just use `original_type` instead of creating a new model with `create_model`.

Below is the corrected `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    if is_dataclass(original_type) and hasattr(original_type, "__pydantic_model__"):
        original_type = original_type.__pydantic_model__  # type: ignore
    use_type = original_type
    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = original_type  # Use the original type if it's a subclass of BaseModel
    else:
        use_type = create_model(original_type.__name__, __config__=original_type.__config__)
        for f in original_type.__fields__.values():
            use_type.__fields__[f.name] = f
        use_type.__validators__ = original_type.__validators__

    # Rest of the code to populate new_field and return it
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle subclassed models and avoid creating unnecessary new models when the original type is already a subclass of `BaseModel`.
