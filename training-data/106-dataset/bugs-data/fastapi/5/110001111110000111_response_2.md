This bug occurs because the function `create_cloned_field` is not correctly cloning the fields, which leads to unexpected data being included in the response. The error in the function is likely causing the nested model to not be filtered according to the specified `response_model`.

The error occurs because the function is not correctly handling the cloning of fields and fails to filter the data according to the specified `response_model`.

To fix the bug, the function `create_cloned_field` needs to be updated to correctly clone the fields and filter the data according to the specified `response_model`. This can be achieved by adjusting how the new_field is created and populated in the function.

Here is the corrected code for the function `create_cloned_field`:

```python
from typing import Type, cast, List
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, ModelField, FieldInfo
from pydantic.class_validators import Validator, gather_all_validators
from pydantic.types import BaseModel
from pydantic.schema import get_model, model_process_schema, get_flat_models_from_fields
from pydantic import create_model, BaseConfig

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    use_type = field.type_
    if lenient_issubclass(use_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = get_model(use_type)

    field_info = FieldInfo(None)
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        required=False,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        field_info=field_info,
    )

    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields]

    return new_field
```

This corrected code properly clones and filters the fields according to the specified `response_model`. It ensures that the nested model is correctly filtered and the data is aligned with the expected response model.
