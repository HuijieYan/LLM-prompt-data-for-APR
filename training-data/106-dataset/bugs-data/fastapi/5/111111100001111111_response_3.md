The issue here is that the nested model attributes are not being filtered according to the specified response_model. This means that when data is returned, it is not being filtered according to the specified response_model.

The source of the problem appears to be in the `create_cloned_field` function. This function is responsible for creating a cloned field based on the input field. It seems that the cloning process is not taking the nested structure into account, which is causing the issue with the response model not being properly filtered for nested attributes.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the cloning process for nested models properly respects the specified response_model.

Below is the corrected `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from typing import Optional

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    
    # Cloning logic for nested models
    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = create_cloned_field(original_type)
    else:
        use_type = original_type
    
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=field.field_info,
        # Copy other attributes as needed
    )
    
    return new_field
```

In the corrected function, when `original_type` is found to be a subclass of `BaseModel`, we recursively call `create_cloned_field` to clone the nested model. This ensures that the response_model is properly respected for nested attributes.

With this correction, the response data should be filtered according to the specified response_model, including for nested models.
