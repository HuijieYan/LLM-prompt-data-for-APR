The potential error location within the problematic function is the parameter `skip_defaults` not being used correctly in the `serialize_response` function. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `skip_defaults` flag is not being applied correctly in the `serialize_response` function, leading to the full model being returned instead of one with skipped defaults.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to correctly use the `skip_defaults` flag in the `serialize_response` function. This might involve checking whether `skip_defaults` is True and applying the flag to the returned JSON if so.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic.fields import Field
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.main import ValidationError
from fastapi.responses import Response

def serialize_response(
    response: Response,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if skip_defaults:
        return jsonable_encoder(
            response,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response)
```

In the corrected code, the `field` parameter was removed as it was not being used in the function. Additionally, the `skip_defaults` flag is now being correctly applied to the returned JSON based on its value.
