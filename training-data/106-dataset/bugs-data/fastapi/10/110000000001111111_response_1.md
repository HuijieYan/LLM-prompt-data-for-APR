The issue seems to be related to the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag not working as expected. The code provided includes a function `serialize_response` that is likely responsible for handling the serialization of the response model. Based on the code and the input and expected variable values, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `response_model_skip_defaults` parameter.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `skip_defaults` parameter is being passed to the `jsonable_encoder` function, which should handle the skipping of default values during serialization. However, the issue might be that this parameter is not being properly propagated to the `jsonable_encoder` function when the field is present.

To fix the issue, the `skip_defaults` parameter needs to be properly handled and passed to the `jsonable_encoder` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic import Field, Response
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Model:
    x: Any
    sub: Any

@dataclass
class SubModel:
    a: str

def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: Field = None,
    response: Response,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = None,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        value, errors_ = field.validate(response, {}, loc=("response",))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response, skip_defaults=skip_defaults)
```

In the corrected code, the `skip_defaults` parameter is now properly handled and passed to the `jsonable_encoder` function. This should address the issue where the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag was not working as expected. This fix ensures that the `skip_defaults` parameter is appropriately handled for both cases when a `field` is present and when it's not present.
