The issue "response_model_skip_defaults doesn't appear to be working" suggests that the response_model_skip_defaults flag is not functioning as expected, returning the full model instead of skipping defaults.

From the detailed issue description and the input/output runtime values and types provided, it appears that the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag is not effectively skipping defaults as intended.

The potential error location within the `serialize_response` function is the handling of the `skip_defaults` parameter. Since the flag `response_model_skip_defaults` is designed to skip default values in the response, it seems that the `skip_defaults` parameter in the `serialize_response` function is not being used effectively to achieve this behavior.

The bug appears to result from the incorrect implementation of the `skip_defaults` parameter. The expected behavior is for the `skip_defaults` flag to be reflected in the serialization process, skipping default values in the response. However, in the provided function, the `skip_defaults` parameter is not effectively utilized to achieve this behavior.

The potential approach for fixing the bug would be to modify the `serialize_response` function to correctly handle the `skip_defaults` parameter and ensure that it properly skips default values when serializing the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any

def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: dict = None,
    response: Any,
    include: set = None,
    exclude: set = None,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False
) -> Any:
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder

    if field:
        errors = []

        if isinstance(response, BaseModel):
            if skip_defaults:
                value = jsonable_encoder(response.dict(skip_defaults=True))
            else:
                value = jsonable_encoder(response)
        else:
            value = response

        return value
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The parameters have been appropriately annotated and handled with their respective default values.
2. The serialization process now correctly handles the `skip_defaults` parameter, ensuring that default values are skipped when serializing the response.

These corrections should address the issue with the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag not working as expected.
