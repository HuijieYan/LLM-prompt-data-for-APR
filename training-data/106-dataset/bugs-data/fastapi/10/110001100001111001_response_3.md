Potential error location: The potential error is in the field validation part of the function. It seems that the field validation is not correctly handling the response and is causing an empty dictionary for 'sub' instead of gathering the expected values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the field validation method is not correctly handling the response and its nested objects.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the field validation method correctly handles nested objects within the response. This may involve modifying the Field and Model classes to handle nested objects during validation.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel, ValidationError, jsonable_encoder

class Response(BaseModel):
    x: Any
    sub: Any

def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: Field = None,
    response: Response,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        value, errors_ = field.validate(response.dict(), {}, loc=("response",))
        if isinstance(errors_, ValidationError):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response.dict())
```
