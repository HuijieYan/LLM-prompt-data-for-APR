The bug seems to be occurring in the `serialize_response` function. The function is using the `jsonable_encoder` method to encode the response, however, it seems that the `skip_defaults` argument is not being honored, resulting in the incorrect output in the test case.

The `skip_defaults` argument should be used to skip default values when encoding the response. However, based on the error message, it seems that the default values are present in the encoded response.

To fix this bug, the `skip_defaults` argument should be correctly implemented when using the `jsonable_encoder` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: Field = None,
    response: Response,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if skip_defaults:
        return response.dict(
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
        )
    else:
        return response.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias)
```

In this corrected version, when `skip_defaults` is `True`, it is used to skip default values in the `response` object when encoding it using the `dict` method.

With this change, the test case should pass as expected.
