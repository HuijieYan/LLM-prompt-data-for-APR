The error message "Methods must be a list" suggests that the variable `route.methods` is expected to be a list, but it is provided as a set. Additionally, there may be issues with the structure and content of the `path` variable, such as "parameters" being a list instead of a dictionary.

The bug occurs in the `get_openapi_path` function when it attempts to validate `route.methods` and then generate the OpenAPI path based on the HTTP methods. The validation error occurs because `route.methods` is a set, but the function expects it to be a list. Additionally, there seem to be issues with the structure of the `path` variable.

To fix the bug, we should convert the `route.methods` set to a list. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `path` variable is structured properly with the correct types of data within it.

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    route_methods = list(route.methods)  # Convert set to list
    assert isinstance(route_methods, list), "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route_methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
