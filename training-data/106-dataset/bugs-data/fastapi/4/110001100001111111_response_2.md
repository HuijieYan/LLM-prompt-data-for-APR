The issue seems to be related to the generation of the OpenAPI schema, specifically with the duplication of parameter IDs when used with dependencies.

The bug is likely occurring within the `get_openapi_path` function, where the parameters for the endpoint are being processed and added to the OpenAPI schema. The duplicate `user_id` parameter is likely being added due to the dependency handling.

The bug appears to be caused by the way parameters are processed and added to the `operation` dictionary. It seems that the parameters are not being deduplicated correctly when dependencies are involved.

To fix this bug, it might be necessary to review the logic for adding parameters to the `operation` dictionary. The duplication could be occurring due to the way parameters from dependencies are being handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            # Deduplicate parameters
            param_names = set()
            unique_params = []
            for param in operation_parameters:
                if param['name'] not in param_names:
                    unique_params.append(param)
                    param_names.add(param['name'])
            parameters.extend(unique_params)
            # ... Rest of the code remains unchanged

        return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

In the correction, I added a section to deduplicate the parameters before adding them to the `operation` dictionary.

This should address the issue of parameter duplication when generating the OpenAPI schema, resolving the bug related to the duplicate parameter IDs.
