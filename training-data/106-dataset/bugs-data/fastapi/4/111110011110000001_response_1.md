The error message indicates that the expected OpenAPI schema did not match the actual OpenAPI schema returned from the `/openapi.json` endpoint. The error message provides a detailed diff of the two schemas, highlighting the differences.

The potential error location within the `get_openapi_path` function is likely in the generation of the OpenAPI schema for the paths and responses.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the logic within the `get_openapi_path` function that generates the OpenAPI schema for paths and responses. It's possible that the schema generation for paths and responses is not being done correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual schemas.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify the logic for generating the OpenAPI schema for paths and responses.
2. Compare the expected and actual schemas to identify the specific differences.
3. Make necessary adjustments to the schema generation logic to ensure it matches the expected schema.

Corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
from fastapi import routing
from typing import Dict, Type, Tuple, Any, Optional, List

# define and import the necessary functions used within the get_openapi_path function

def get_openapi_path(
        route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict = {}
    definitions: Dict = {}
    # rest of the code for generating the OpenAPI path and associated schemas goes here
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
