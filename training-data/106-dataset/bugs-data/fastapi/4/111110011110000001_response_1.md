Here's the full code of the fixed `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
from typing import Dict, Type, Any, Tuple, List, Optional
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def get_openapi_path(
    route: APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str)
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        # rest of the code remains the same

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
