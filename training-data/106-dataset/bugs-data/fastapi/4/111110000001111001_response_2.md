The bug in the given function arises from the recursive call to the same function within the function itself. The get_openapi_path() function is calling itself recursively inside the for loop when checking for route.callbacks. This recursive call should be replaced with a call to a different function.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to create a separate function to handle the logic for processing route.callbacks. Then, replace the recursive call to get_openapi_path() with the call to this new function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_route_callbacks(route, model_name_map):
    callbacks = {}
    for callback in route.callbacks:
        cb_path, cb_security_schemes, cb_definitions = get_openapi_path(
            route=callback, model_name_map=model_name_map
        )
        callbacks[callback.name] = {callback.path: cb_path}
    return callbacks


def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    # Existing code

    if route.callbacks:
        callbacks = process_route_callbacks(route, model_name_map)
        operation["callbacks"] = callbacks

    # Existing code
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
