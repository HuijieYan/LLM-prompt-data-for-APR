The potential error in the `get_openapi_path` function is that it's trying to recursively call itself within `get_openapi_path` function without any exit condition. This could lead to infinite recursion and stack overflow.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the existing `get_openapi_path` function to another name, and then create a new `get_openapi_path` function with a different implementation.

The corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function is as follows:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def get_openapi_path_impl(
    route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            parameters.extend(operation_parameters)
            # ... (omitted code) ...
    return path, security_schemes, definitions

def get_openapi_path(
    route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    return get_openapi_path_impl(route, model_name_map)
```

In this corrected code, I've renamed the original `get_openapi_path` to `get_openapi_path_impl`, and then created a new `get_openapi_path` function that simply calls `get_openapi_path_impl` with the same input parameters. This approach avoids recursive calls and fixes the bug.
