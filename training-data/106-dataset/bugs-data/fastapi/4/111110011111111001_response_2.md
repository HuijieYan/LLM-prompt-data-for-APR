The error occurs because the function `get_openapi_path` is unable to correctly handle repeating path parameters. In this case, the path parameter 'user_id' is repeated, causing issues in the OpenAPI schema generation.

The bug occurs in the block of code where the 'parameters' list is being extended in the 'for' loop for each method in the route. Since the 'parameters' list is extended multiple times within the loop, it ends up containing duplicate path parameters. This is the reason for the error that is being thrown during comparison of the expected and actual OpenAPI schemas.

To fix this bug, the 'parameters' list needs to be accessed and extended only once for each method in the route, rather than being extended for each iteration within the loop.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            
            # Initialize parameters list once for each method
            parameters: List[Dict] = []

            # Other code remains unchanged...
            # ... (omitting for brevity)

            # Extend parameters list with new parameters
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            parameters.extend(operation_parameters)

            # Other code remains unchanged...
            # ... (omitting for brevity)

            path[method.lower()] = operation
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

By initializing and extending the 'parameters' list only once for each method, the bug related to repeating path parameters will be fixed, and the OpenAPI schema generation should behave as expected.
