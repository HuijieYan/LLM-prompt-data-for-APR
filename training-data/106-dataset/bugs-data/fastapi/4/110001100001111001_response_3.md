Potential Error location:
The error seems to be in the creation of the `parameters` list. The code appends the same parameters from `all_route_params` to the `parameters` list without any transformation or filtering. This causes the `parameters` list to duplicate its elements.

Reason:
The `parameters` list is updated with the same set of parameters from `all_route_params` on each iteration of the for loop. This results in the duplication of parameters within the `parameters` list.

Approach to fix:
1. Clear the `parameters` list before iterating over the methods to ensure that it doesn't contain duplicates.
2. Filter out any duplicate parameters that may arise from `all_route_params` and then add them to the `parameters` list.

Code:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            parameters: List[Dict] = []  # Clear the parameters list before iteration
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```
By adding the line `parameters: List[Dict] = []` within the for loop, we ensure that the `parameters` list is cleared when iterating over different methods, preventing the duplication of parameters.
