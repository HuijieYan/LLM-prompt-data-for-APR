The bug is occurring because the function `get_openapi_path` is adding the same parameter twice when there is a dependency on the route. This is causing the generated OpenAPI schema to have duplicate parameter IDs.

To fix this bug, the section of the code that adds the parameters for the route and the dependencies needs to be modified. Specifically, the loop that iterates over the route methods should skip adding parameters if the method belongs to a dependency.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            if not hasattr(route, "dependant"):
                continue  # Skip adding parameters if it's a dependency
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            # Remaining code for adding security schemes and other parameters
```

In this corrected code, we check if the route has a "dependant" attribute, and if it does not, we skip adding parameters for the route. This prevents the duplicate parameters issue when there is a dependency on the route.

After making this change, the function should generate an OpenAPI schema without the issue of duplicate parameter IDs.
