The error occurs because the `parameters` list is being extended multiple times within the for loop for different `method` types without being reset. This leads to redundant parameters being added to the list.

The buggy function fails to reset the `parameters` list for each method, causing the list to accumulate parameters from all methods. To fix this, we need to reset the `parameters` list for each method iteration.

Additionally, it's worth considering the logic for updating the `path` dictionary with the `operation`. It seems that the `path` dictionary should be updated with the `operation` inside the for loop for different methods.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            # Reset parameters for each method iteration
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
                
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            parameters.extend(operation_parameters)
            
            # ... Rest of the code

            if parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = parameters

            # Update path with the operation for the specific method
            path[method.lower()] = operation
                
        return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

This corrected function resets the `parameters` list for each iteration of the for loop and updates the `path` dictionary with the `operation` for the specific method.
