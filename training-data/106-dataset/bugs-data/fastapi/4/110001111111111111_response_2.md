The bug seems to be related to the `parameters` list which may be getting duplicated. Since the function `get_openapi_path` is supposed to return the `parameters` for a given route, it seems like the issue could be with how the parameters are being generated and added to the list.

One possible reason for the duplication of parameters could be that the function `get_openapi_params` is returning the same parameter multiple times due to some issue in how it processes the `route.dependant`.

To fix the bug, the logic for generating the parameters needs to be reviewed. This involves checking how `get_openapi_params`, `get_flat_dependant`, and related functions are functioning. Ensure that the parameters are unique and not duplicated before adding them to the `parameters` list.

Here's the corrected code for the function `get_openapi_path`:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            seen_names = set()
            for param in all_route_params:
                if param.name not in seen_names:
                    parameters.append(param)
                    seen_names.add(param.name)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(parameters)
            if operation_parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = operation_parameters
            
            # rest of the code remains the same...
```

In this correction, the `parameters` list is populated by iterating over `all_route_params` and checking if each parameter's name is already in the `seen_names` set. If it is not seen, the parameter is added to the `parameters` list and its name is added to the `seen_names` set. This ensures that duplicate parameters are not added to the list. The rest of the code remains the same.
