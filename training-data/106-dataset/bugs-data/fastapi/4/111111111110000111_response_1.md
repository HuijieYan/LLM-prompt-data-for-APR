The test case involves a POST request to "/users/{user_id}" with a dependency that checks if the user with the given ID exists. The OpenAPI schema generated from this test case contains duplicated parameter IDs for the "user_id" in the "parameters" field.

Looking at the `get_openapi_path` function, it seems that the issue could be related to how the path parameters are processed. Since the test case involves a POST request with a dependency, the function might be incorrectly handling the dependency parameters, causing duplication.

The bug occurs because the `get_openapi_path` function is not correctly handling the parameters when there are dependencies involved. It seems to be adding the same parameter twice, which leads to duplication in the OpenAPI schema.

To fix the bug, the `get_openapi_path` function should be modified to handle the generation of parameters when dependencies are involved. Specifically, it should ensure that parameters from dependencies are not duplicated in the OpenAPI schema.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            # ... (omitted code) ...
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            
            # Remove duplicate parameters based on name
            parameters = [obj for i, obj in enumerate(operation_parameters) if obj["name"] not in [p["name"] for p in operation_parameters[i+1:]]]
            
            operation["parameters"] = parameters
            # ... (omitted code) ...
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

The corrected code includes a step to remove duplicate parameters based on their names before adding them to the `parameters` list. This will prevent the duplication of parameters in the OpenAPI schema when dependencies are involved.
