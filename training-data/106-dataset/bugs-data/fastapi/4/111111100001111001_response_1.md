The provided function `get_openapi_path` is missing a correct way of returning the expected output and is not handling the method `GET` properly. It seems to be adding a parameter twice in the `parameters` list, and it is using a wrong key to add a value to the `path` dictionary. Also, it is not correctly adding the responses and request body to the operation.

The reason behind the bug is a combination of incorrect usage of the method `GET`, appending parameters twice, and using incorrect keys in dictionaries.

To fix the bug, we need to take care of the following:
1. Ensure that the method `GET` is handled correctly by checking if it exists within the route methods using `if 'GET' in route.methods`.
2. Use the method name to set the operation in the `path` dictionary using `path[method.lower()] = operation`.
3. Correctly handle the responses and request body for the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        if 'GET' in route.methods:
            method = 'get'
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            if route.dependant:
                all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
                operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
                parameters = operation_parameters
                operation["parameters"] = parameters
            if route.response_fields:
                response = {}
                field = route.response_fields.get('200')
                if field:
                    response_schema, _, _ = field_schema(
                        field, model_name_map=model_name_map, ref_prefix=REF_PREFIX
                    )
                    response.setdefault("content", {}).setdefault(
                        route_response_media_type or "application/json", {}
                    )["schema"] = response_schema
                response["description"] = "Successful Response"
                operation.setdefault("responses", {}).setdefault('200', {}).update(response)
            path[method] = operation

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
