Potential Error:
The potential error in the given function is in the `indexed` variable assignment within the `else` block. The 'indexed' variable is being assigned different types of DataFrames based on the conditions, which may lead to inconsistency in the return type.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'indexed' variable is being reassigned with different types of DataFrames based on the conditions, leading to inconsistency in the return type.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can ensure that the 'indexed' variable is consistently assigned the same type of DataFrame throughout the function. This can be achieved by restructuring the code and ensuring that the return type is always consistent, irrespective of the conditions.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def pivot(data: DataFrame, index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> DataFrame:
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if values and not isinstance(values, str):
            # Exclude string because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```
