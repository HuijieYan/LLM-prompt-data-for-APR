The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute on a 'NoneType' object. This is likely occurring within the _engine function which is being used as a property.

The error is likely occurring because the _engine function is not returning the correct value, leading to the attribute access on a 'NoneType' object.

To fix the bug, the _engine function needs to return the correct value. It should return an instance of the engine, not 'None'.

Here's the corrected code for the _engine function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    return property(func)

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```
