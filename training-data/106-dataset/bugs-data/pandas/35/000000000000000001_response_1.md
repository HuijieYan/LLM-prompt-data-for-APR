The potential error in the provided function is the use of a decorator `@cache_readonly` which is not defined in the given code. This decorator is likely intended to cache the result of the `_engine` function to improve performance by only computing the result once.

The error likely occurs because the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not defined, and therefore the function is not behaving as intended.

To fix this issue, the `@cache_readonly` decorator needs to be defined and then applied to the `_engine` function. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    cached_value = None
    def wrapper(self):
        nonlocal cached_value
        if cached_value is None:
            cached_value = func(self)
        return cached_value
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `cache_readonly` decorator is defined to cache the result of the function. Then, the decorator is applied to the `_engine` function to achieve the intended caching behavior.
