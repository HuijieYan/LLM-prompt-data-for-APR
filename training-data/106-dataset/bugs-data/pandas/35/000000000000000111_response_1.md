Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the _engine method where the weakref of the self object is not being utilized properly, leading to a None being passed to the _engine_type.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The weakref of the self object is not being stored or used properly within the _engine method, leading to a reference cycle and subsequently a None being passed to the _engine_type.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to store the weak reference of the self object and pass it to _engine_type.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is properly stored and utilized within the _engine method to avoid a reference cycle.

Corrected Code:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_result'):
            self._cached_result = func(self)
        return self._cached_result
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
