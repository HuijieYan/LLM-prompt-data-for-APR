The bug is likely occurring because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended to. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, and that it is passed to the `PeriodEngine` as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we are now calling `period()` to get the actual reference to the `PeriodIndex` before passing it to the `PeriodEngine` as intended. This should fix the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.
