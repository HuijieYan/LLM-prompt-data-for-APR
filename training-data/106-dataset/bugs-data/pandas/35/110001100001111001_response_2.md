The issue with the given function is that the weak reference `period` should be passed as an argument to `_engine_type` instead of `self`. This is causing a reference cycle and resulting in a bug.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
