The potential error location within the function is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being assigned to anything and is not being used in the subsequent code.

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not being used in the function. This means that the weak reference is not being maintained, causing the reference to `self` to be dropped before it is intended to be.

To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference `period` in the subsequent code to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained. We can then pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` method.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_weakref'):
            self._engine_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        period = self._engine_weakref
        return func(self._engine_type(period, len(self)))
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we are now creating a weak reference to `self` and storing it in the `_engine_weakref` attribute. Then in the `_engine` method, we are using this weak reference when calling `_engine_type` to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained. This should fix the bug and prevent the reference to `self` from being dropped prematurely.
