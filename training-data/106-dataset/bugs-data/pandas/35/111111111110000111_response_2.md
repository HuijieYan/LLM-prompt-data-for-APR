The error occurs when the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check if all levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` type object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to a problem with weak referencing in the `_engine` function of `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` should be properly maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` will be maintained within the `_engine` function, and the `PeriodEngine` should receive the correct object when checking for monotonic behavior.
