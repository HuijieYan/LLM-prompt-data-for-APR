The bug occurs in the `_engine` function, specifically in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The purpose of this line is to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not maintained correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained properly so that it does not get dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a class-level variable to ensure it persists as long as needed.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(PeriodIndex, "_weakref"):
        PeriodIndex._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(PeriodIndex._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a class-level variable, the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will persist as long as it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue of the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
