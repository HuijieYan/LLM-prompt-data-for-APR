The potential error in the provided function is the use of 'cache_readonly'. This is not a recognized decorator in Python.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that 'cache_readonly' is not a valid decorator, so it is causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the appropriate decorator for caching in Python. One common one is the '@property' decorator, which can be used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute and will also cache the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function using the '@property' decorator:
```python
@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
