Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` function. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` may not be preserving the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object as intended.

Reasons behind the bug:
The use of `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, which may not be preserved as expected. This can lead to the `PeriodIndex` object being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Instead of using a weak reference, a strong reference to the `self` object should be used in the `_engine` function to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.

Corrected code for the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
