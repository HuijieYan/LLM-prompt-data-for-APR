Potential error location:
The error may be occurring in the _engine function where a weak reference of self is created but not properly used, leading to a None being passed to the _engine_type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The weak reference of self is not being properly utilized, leading to the reference being dropped before it's intended. This causes the _engine_type to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the weak reference of self correctly to ensure it is not dropped prematurely.
2. Ensure that the _engine_type receives the correct input type and value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    # This is a custom decorator that needs to be implemented separately

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
