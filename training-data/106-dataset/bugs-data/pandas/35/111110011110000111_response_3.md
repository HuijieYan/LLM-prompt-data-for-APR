Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function when calling the `is_monotonic` method on the `idx2.levels`. This method accesses the `PeriodEngine` which is likely to be related to the `weakref` issue mentioned in the error message.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely related to the weak reference handling of the `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`. It seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error when the `PeriodEngine` tries to access it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the operation, so that it is not prematurely dropped.
2. Verify that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instead of a `NoneType`.

Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected code for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period_index_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store a weak reference to the PeriodIndex
        if self._engine_type is not None:  # Check if _engine_type is defined
            return self._engine_type(period_index_ref, len(self))  # Use the weak reference and length
        else:
            return None  # Return None if _engine_type is not defined
```

In the corrected code:
- We store a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) using the `weakref.ref` function.
- We check if the `_engine_type` is not `None` before using it, to avoid potential issues with accessing attributes or methods on a `NoneType`.
- If `_engine_type` is not defined, we return `None`.
  
This approach ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained and used appropriately, addressing the potential premature dropping of the weak reference.
