Potential Error Location:
The potential error is occurring in the _engine function, where the weakref.ref(self) is being used.

Reasons behind the bug:
The weakref.ref(self) is likely causing the issue because it returns a weak reference to the 'self' object, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the weakref usage and directly pass 'self' to the _engine_type function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
