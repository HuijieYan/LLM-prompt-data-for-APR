Potential error location: The error in the provided code is the reference to the `weakref` module without importing it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code tries to use `weakref` without importing it first, which results in a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `weakref` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file where the `@cache_readonly` decorator is used.

Corrected code:

```python
import weakref  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# ... omitted code ...

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ... (rest of the class remains unchanged) ...

    # this is the fixed function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
