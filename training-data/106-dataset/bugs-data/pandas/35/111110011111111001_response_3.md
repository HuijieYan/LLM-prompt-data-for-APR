The error occurs when the method `is_monotonic_increasing` is called and attempts to access the `self._engine` attribute which is a `PeriodEngine` object. However, the attribute `_engine` of the PeriodIndex class is a cached readonly property which should return the `PeriodEngine` instance.

The bug is in the `_engine` method. The `_engine` method should return the instantiation of the `self._engine_type` class which is `PeriodEngine`. However, the existing implementation does not return the PeriodEngine instance and instead returns `None`.

To fix this, modify the `_engine` method to ensure that it returns the correct `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By returning the `self._engine_type` instance, the bug should be fixed, and the error should be resolved.
