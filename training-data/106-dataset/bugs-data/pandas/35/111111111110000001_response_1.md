1. The test case is checking for monotonicity of the levels in the `idx2` object, which is created from a MultiIndex `idx`. The MultiIndex is created from a PeriodIndex `idx` and the error occurs when checking the monotonicity using the `is_monotonic` method.

2. The potential error location is the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.

3. The error message indicates that an attribute `view` is being called on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that there is an issue with the implementation of the `_engine` method, potentially resulting in it returning a `None` object instead of the expected type.

4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should be updated to return the correct type of object, ensuring that it does not return `None`.

5. Corrected `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```
