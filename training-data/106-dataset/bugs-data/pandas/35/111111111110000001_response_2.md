Potential Error Location:
The error occurs at the line `idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])` in the test function, where the `idx._get_level_values(level)` method is called. This method seems to be related to the problematic function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class.

Reasons Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The error message indicates that an 'AttributeError' occurs because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `PeriodEngine` instance used in the function call is unexpectedly a 'NoneType', and as a result, it does not have the 'view' attribute.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class returns a valid `PeriodEngine` instance instead of 'None'.
2. Verify the initialization and setup of the `PeriodEngine` instance to prevent it from being 'None'.
3. Check for any conditions that might lead to the `_engine` method returning 'None' or an uninitialized state.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
# Fixed _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid initialization of PeriodEngine")
    return engine
```
