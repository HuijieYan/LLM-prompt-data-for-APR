The bug seems to be in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The method is using `weakref` to create a reference to `self`, but it's returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` which could be leading to a `NoneType` object error.

To fix the bug, instead of returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we should return `self.`_engine_type`.vgetter().view("i8")`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type.vgetter().view("i8")
```
