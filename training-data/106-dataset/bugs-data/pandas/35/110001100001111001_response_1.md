The bug in the provided function is the incorrect use of the `@cache_readonly` decorator. The decorator is typically used for methods that should be computed only once and then cached for future use. However, in the given function, it seems like the intention is to create a property, not a cached method. 

To fix this bug, we need to replace `@cache_readonly` with `@property`. This will define the `_engine` function as a property of the class, allowing it to be accessed as an attribute without the need for parentheses.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
