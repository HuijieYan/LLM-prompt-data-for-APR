The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `PeriodEngine` is receiving a NoneType instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` which leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the attribute 'view'.

This issue is most likely caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a None value instead. This behavior breaks the expected weak reference mechanism and causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive incorrect input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained within the `_engine` method so that it is not inadvertently dropped. Additionally, we need to handle the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` appropriately within the `PeriodEngine` to prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected and refactored method:

```python
# Corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if the weakly referenced self is not None
    if period_ref() is None:
        raise ValueError("Weakly referenced PeriodIndex is None")
    
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This solution introduces additional error handling to ensure that the weak reference is not lost. It also provides a ValueError in case the weakly referenced PeriodIndex becomes None. This fix should address the weak reference issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
