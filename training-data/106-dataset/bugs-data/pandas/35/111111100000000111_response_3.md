Error location:
The issue seems to be related to the weak reference in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class. The weak reference to the PeriodIndex is getting dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the bug:
The weak reference in the _engine function is not being handled properly, leading to the premature dropping of the reference.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function.
2. Check for any potential issues with weak reference handling in the _engine function.
3. Verify that the weak reference is being used correctly and is not getting garbage collected prematurely.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if len(self) > 0 else 1)  # Ensure a minimum length of 1 to prevent premature dropping of the weak reference
```
