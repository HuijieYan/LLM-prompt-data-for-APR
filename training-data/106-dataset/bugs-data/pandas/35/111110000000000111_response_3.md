The potential error location within the function is the weakref.ref(self) line. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference to the object passed to it, but the problem here is that it's not being used correctly, leading to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

The weakref.ref(self) line is meant to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object to avoid a reference cycle and to pass it to _engine_type, but it's not being used effectively in the current implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is used properly and not dropped prematurely.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we create a weak reference to the object using weakref.proxy() instead of weakref.ref(). This ensures that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, allowing the PeriodEngine to receive the correct reference to the PeriodIndex.
