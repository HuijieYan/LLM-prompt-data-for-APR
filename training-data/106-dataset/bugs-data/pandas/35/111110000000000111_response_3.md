Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the weak reference to self passed to _engine_type. It appears that the weak reference is being dropped before it should be, leading to _engine_type receiving None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The weak reference to self is being dropped prematurely, possibly due to improper handling of the weak reference in the _engine function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained throughout the execution of the _engine function, so that it is not prematurely dropped.
2. Check the implementation of _engine_type to ensure that it can correctly handle the weak reference to the PeriodIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
