1. The test case is attempting to use the `is_monotonic` attribute on a pandas Index. The error message indicates that the bug is related to `PeriodEngine` and its attribute access.

2. The potential error location is in the `_engine` function where the `self._engine_type` is called to instantiate the `PeriodEngine`.

3. The bug is occurring because the `PeriodEngine` is not being instantiated correctly within the `_engine` method, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the `PeriodEngine` object.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is being instantiated correctly within the `_engine` method. This may involve passing the correct arguments to the `PeriodEngine` constructor.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
import weakref

def cache_readonly(func):
    def wrapper(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_cached_engine'):
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            self._cached_engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return self._cached_engine
    return wrapper
```
