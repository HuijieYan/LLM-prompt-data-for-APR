The bug is in the `_add_margins` function. The bug is likely related to the computation of margins in the `pivot_table` function, specifically related to how integer division is handled for the `aggfunc='mean'` option.

The bug occurs due to the `aggfunc` value being set to 'mean', which results in integer division, causing discrepancies in the output compared to the expected values.

To fix the bug, the `_add_margins` function should include handling for integer division when using the 'mean' aggregation function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_add_margins` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _add_margins(
    table: pd.DataFrame,
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    # existing code ...

    result = pd.pivot_table(data, index=rows, columns=cols, values=values, aggfunc=aggfunc)
    
    if margins_name != "":
        result["All"] = result.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        
    return result
```

This correction involves using the `pd.pivot_table` function to calculate margins with the 'mean' aggregation function. The `mean` method used to calculate the 'All' margin ensures that correct division and floating-point values are calculated. Additionally, the conditional check for `margins_name` ensures that the 'All' margin values are only appended when `margins_name` is not empty (i.e., when margins are enabled).

This should fix the bug related to the integer division and provide correct float values for margins.
