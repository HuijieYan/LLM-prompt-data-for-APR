The error message indicates that there is a difference in data type ("dtype") for the third column of the result compared to the expected output. It shows that the data type is "int64" for the result and "float64" for the expected output.

The bug is likely to be located in the section of the function where the table is being appended and the data types are not being correctly handled. It seems that the function is not handling the data type conversion from "int64" to "float64" for the margins.

The reason behind the bug is that when the margins are calculated, the datatype appears to be inferred as "int64" and is not correctly casted to "float64" where needed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion is handled properly when adding margins to the result.

Below is the corrected code for the `_add_margins` function:

```python
def _add_margins(
    table: Union["Series", "DataFrame"],
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    # ... (previous code)

    result, margin_keys, row_margin = marginal_result_set

    if isinstance(row_margin, pd.Series):
        # Convert the data type of the margin to float if it's not already float
        row_margin = row_margin.astype(float)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, after extracting the result, margin_keys, and row_margin from the marginal_result_set, we explicitly check if the `row_margin` is of type Series and then convert its data type to float if it's not already a float. This would ensure that the generated margin values are of type float, allowing for consistent comparisons with the expected output in the test cases.

This should address the bug and ensure that the margins and the result have the same data types, resolving the AssertionError encountered in the test.
