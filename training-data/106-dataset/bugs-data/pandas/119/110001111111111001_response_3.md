Based on the error message and test functions, it seems that the issue is related to data types in the DataFrame.

The error message specifically mentions a difference in data types, indicating that there may be a data type inconsistency in the "DataFrame.iloc[:, 2]" attribute.

From the expected variable values in the test case, it is clear that the DataFrame should have float data types, but the error message indicates a data type of int64.

This disparity suggests that there might be a type casting issue while computing the margins, resulting in the wrong data types in the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the function should ensure that the data types are preserved correctly when computing the margins and adding them to the DataFrame.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _add_margins(
    table: Union["Series", "DataFrame"],
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    # ... (omitted code)
    result_cols = set(result.columns)
    for dtype in set(result.dtypes):
        dtype_cols = result.select_dtypes([dtype]).columns
        if result_cols.intersection(dtype_cols):
            result[dtype_cols] = result[dtype_cols].astype(dtype)
    # ... (omitted code)
```

In the corrected code, the function ensures that data types are preserved when computing the margins and adding them to the DataFrame. It iterates over the columns and selects the appropriate data type for conversion, ensuring that the data types remain consistent with the expected results.
