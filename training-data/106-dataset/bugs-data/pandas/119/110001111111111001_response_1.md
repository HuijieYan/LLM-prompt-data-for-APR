The error message indicates that there is a data type mismatch for one of the attributes of the DataFrame objects being compared. The error message specifically mentions a mismatch between the "dtype" attribute, where the left side is of type int64 and the right side is of type float64.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to the computation of the grand margin. The function _compute_grand_margin(data, values, aggfunc, margins_name) calculates the grand margin, and the bug may be related to the computation or formatting of the resulting grand margin.

The data used in the test case does not have any non-integer values, however, the expected result includes floating-point values for the margins. This suggests that the row_margin and/or grand_margin are possibly being formatted as integers instead of floats.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the grand margin and row margin are appropriately formatted as floats when required, to match the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the _add_margins function:

```python
def _add_margins(
    table: Union["Series", "DataFrame"],
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    if not isinstance(margins_name, str):
        raise ValueError("margins_name argument must be a string")

    msg = 'Conflicting name "{name}" in margins'.format(name=margins_name)
    for level in table.index.names:
        if margins_name in table.index.get_level_values(level):
            raise ValueError(msg)

    grand_margin = _compute_grand_margin(data, values, aggfunc, margins_name)

    # Convert types to float if values are not empty
    if values:
        for k, v in grand_margin.items():
            grand_margin[k] = float(v)

    if table.ndim == 2:
        # i.e. DataFrame
        for level in table.columns.names[1:]:
            if margins_name in table.columns.get_level_values(level):
                raise ValueError(msg)

    key: str
    if len(rows) > 1:
        key = (margins_name,) + ("",) * (len(rows) - 1)
    else:
        key = margins_name

    # rest of the function remains unchanged 
    ...
```

By updating the grand_margin to ensure that its values are floats when required, we can address the type mismatch issue and ensure that the output matches the expected results.
