The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the margin values in the `pd.pivot_table` function when the `margins=True`. The problem occurs when the default `aggfunc` is 'mean' and the values are integers. This results in an incorrect integer division, leading to unexpected margin values.

The potential error location within the provided function is likely in the `_add_margins` function, specifically in the computation of the margin values for the pivot table.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect computation of margin values due to integer division when the default `aggfunc` is 'mean' and the values are integers.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the proper data types are used to calculate the margin values, especially when performing aggregation operations like 'mean'. This may involve ensuring that the values are treated as floating point numbers for accurate division.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _add_margins(
    table: Union["Series", "DataFrame"],
    data,
    values,
    rows,
    cols,
    aggfunc,
    observed=None,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    fill_value=None,
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if not values and isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        # If there are no values and the table is a series, then there is only
        # one column in the data. Compute grand margin and return it.
        return table.append(Series({key: grand_margin[margins_name]}, dtype=float))  # Ensure values are returned as floats

    # ... (existing code)

    elif values:
        marginal_result_set = _generate_marginal_results(
            table,
            data,
            values,
            rows,
            cols,
            aggfunc,
            observed,
            grand_margin,
            margins_name,
        )
        if not isinstance(marginal_result_set, tuple):
            return marginal_result_set
        result, margin_keys, row_margin = marginal_result_set
    else:
        # no values, and table is a DataFrame
        assert isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame)
        marginal_result_set = _generate_marginal_results_without_values(
            table, data, rows, cols, aggfunc, observed, margins_name
        )
        if not isinstance(marginal_result_set, tuple):
            return marginal_result_set
        result, margin_keys, row_margin = marginal_result_set

    row_margin = row_margin.reindex(result.columns, fill_value=fill_value)

    # ... (existing code)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the key change is in ensuring that the margin values are returned as floats when there are no values and the table is a series. This should address the issue of integer division when calculating the margin values.
