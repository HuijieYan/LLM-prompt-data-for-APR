The potential error location could be identified as the possible error in the function "get_grouper" is at the section where it checks if level is compatible with the passed axis of the object. The code contains several nested if-else blocks, which makes it difficult to follow the logic.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the excessively nested if-else blocks and the complex logic, which makes it difficult to understand and maintain.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the code to reduce the complexity of the nested if-else blocks.
2. Separate the logic into smaller, more manageable functions for better readability and maintainability.
3. Use comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if hasattr(group_axis, 'levels') and isinstance(level, int):
            if level >= len(group_axis.levels):
                raise IndexError("Invalid level number")
            level = group_axis.levels[level]

    if isinstance(key, (Grouper, ops.BaseGrouper)):
        g = key
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
        g = []
        for k in keys:
            # additional processing of keys
            if isinstance(k, (list, tuple, np.ndarray)):
                g.append(
                    Grouping(group_axis, k, obj=obj, name=None, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=None, dropna=dropna)
                )
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid key")
    if not g:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        
    grouper = ops.BaseGrouper(group_axis, g, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```
