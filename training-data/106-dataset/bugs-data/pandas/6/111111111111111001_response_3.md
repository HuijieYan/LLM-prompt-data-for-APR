The error message is raised at the line `grp = ser.groupby(level="A")` in the `test_size_period_index` function. This suggests that there might be an issue related to grouping by the period index level "A". 

The potential error location within the problematic function could be: 
1. The `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions where the handling of the period index might be causing issues.
2. The validation process for the date string not being recognized as a proper datetime, leading to the `ValueError`.

The probable reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. In the `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions, there could be an issue with checking the period index value correctly, leading to an incorrect `loc` value being used that is not recognized as a proper datetime.
2. The date string not being recognized as a proper datetime might be due to an issue with the date parsing for the period index.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Ensure that the `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions handle the period index values correctly and provide the appropriate `loc` value for datetime recognition.
2. Verify the date parsing mechanism for the period index to accurately recognize the datetime.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (existing implementation) ...

    # Validate the process for date string parsing and recognition
    try:
        pd.Period(level)  # Attempt to parse the level as a period
    except (ValueError, pd.errors.OutOfBoundsDatetime):  # Catch potential parsing errors
        raise ValueError('Given date string not likely a datetime.')

    # ... (remaining existing implementation) ...
    # Ensure that the remaining parts of the function handle period index values correctly.
```
In this corrected code, we are attempting to parse the `level` as a period and catching potential parsing errors to ensure that it is recognized as a proper datetime. Additionally, we need to verify that the remaining parts of the code handle period index values correctly.
