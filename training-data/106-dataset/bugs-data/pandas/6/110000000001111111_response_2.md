Based on the test input provided and the error message received, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of the PeriodIndex in the `get_grouper` function of pandas.

The error message indicates a problem with the date string when grouping by the PeriodIndex level, which suggests that the issue might be related to the handling of the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the `get_grouper` function seems to be in the section where it checks if `level` is compatible with the passed axis of the object, and when it checks for the presence of the level in the group axis.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there might be inconsistencies in the checks related to the PeriodIndex, causing the error when trying to handle the date string for grouping.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of PeriodIndex is consistent and correctly checks the compatibility of the level with the axis of the object.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)  # Moved this line inside the level check

        if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):  # Check if the group axis is a PeriodIndex
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:  # Ensure level is a list-like object with length 1
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # Allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            # (e.g., level=[0])
            # GH 13901
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj._get_axis(axis).name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name "
                        f"of the {obj._get_axis_name(axis)}"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (rest of the function)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, the handling of `level` and `group_axis` for `PeriodIndex` has been adjusted to ensure that it is consistent and correctly checks the compatibility of the level with the axis of the object. This should address the issue related to the error when grouping by the PeriodIndex level.
