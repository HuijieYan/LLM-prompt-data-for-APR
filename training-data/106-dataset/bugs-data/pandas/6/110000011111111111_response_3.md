The error occurs when trying to group a Series with a PeriodIndex by the level "A" and then calling the size method. The error message suggests that there may be an issue with interpreting the date string as a datetime.

The potential error location is within the `get_grouper` function, particularly in the logic for handling the level, keys, and groupings.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the PeriodIndex data type correctly when grouping by level.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling groupers and levels is updated to properly handle the PeriodIndex data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(obj: FrameOrSeries, key=None, axis: int = 0, level=None,
                sort: bool = True, observed: bool = False, mutated: bool = False,
                validate: bool = True, dropna: bool = True) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    ...
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if hasattr(group_axis, 'levels') and level in group_axis.levels[0]:
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
        elif isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            raise ValueError("Level not found in MultiIndex")
        else:
            if level in group_axis.names:
                level = None
                key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the updated code, we explicitly check for the presence of levels in the Index or MultiIndex and use the 'levels' attribute to get the level values if available. We also handle the case where the level is found in the group axis names. Finally, we return the grouper, exclusions, and obj as before.

This should resolve the error and ensure that grouping by level with a PeriodIndex works correctly.
