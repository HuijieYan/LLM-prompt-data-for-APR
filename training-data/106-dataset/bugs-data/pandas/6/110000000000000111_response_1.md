Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `get_grouper` function when trying to group by a PeriodIndex level. The error arises from the logic surrounding how level names are handled, specifically when checking if the level is present in the object's index.

Reason behind the bug: The error occurs because when grouping by a PeriodIndex level, the logic for handling level names is not correctly identifying the level and is instead treating it as a date string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling level names in the `get_grouper` function to specifically handle PeriodIndex levels.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the level and does not treat it as a date string.
3. Include proper validation and error handling for PeriodIndex levels to prevent the ValueError from being raised.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodIndex

def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    [Rest of the function remains the same]
    """

    if isinstance(obj.index, PeriodIndex) and level is not None:
        # Modify the logic to handle PeriodIndex levels
        if level == obj.index.name:
            key = obj.index
            level = None

    # [Rest of the function remains the same]
```

In the corrected function, a specific check is added to handle PeriodIndex levels in a way that correctly identifies the level and avoids treating it as a date string. This modification addresses the issue related to grouping by a PeriodIndex level and should prevent the ValueError from being raised.
