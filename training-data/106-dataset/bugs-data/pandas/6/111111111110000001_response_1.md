The error message is related to a problem in the `get_grouper` function. It seems that the issue is with the `is_in_obj` function called within `get_grouper`. It is trying to compare a value in a Series with its name, which may not be a valid comparison.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to an incorrect comparison within the `is_in_obj` function. It tries to directly compare the value with `gpr.name`, which is causing a ValueError in the test case.

To fix the bug, we could modify the `is_in_obj` function to handle cases where `gpr` is a string or a scalar value. Additionally, we need to handle errors more gracefully and avoid direct comparisons between different data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    # if the grouper is obj[name]
    def is_in_obj(gpr) -> bool:
        if isinstance(gpr, (str, int, float)):
            return gpr in obj
        return False

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        
        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
            in_axis, name = True, gpr
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            in_axis, name = False, None

        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
