The issue seems to be in the `get_grouper` function, where it fails to properly handle a PeriodIndex when grouping by level.

The error message indicates that the given date string is not likely a datetime, which implies that the function is encountering an issue with parsing the date string within the PeriodIndex.

The potential error location seems to be around the part of the code where it checks for the level and handles the grouping when the axis is a PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle PeriodIndex when grouping by level. This may involve checking the type of the index and adjusting the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    ...

    ... (other comments)

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
            # Handle PeriodIndex
            if isinstance(level, (int, str)):
                # Convert single level to a list
                level = [level]
            if isinstance(level, list):
                if group_axis.name not in level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level {level} is not the name of the PeriodIndex"
                    )
                level = group_axis.get_loc(level)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific check for PeriodIndex and adjusted the logic for handling the level when it is a PeriodIndex. This should address the issue related to grouping by level with a PeriodIndex.
