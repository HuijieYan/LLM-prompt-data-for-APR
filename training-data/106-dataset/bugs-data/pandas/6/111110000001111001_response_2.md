The bug seems to be occurring due to the handling of the 'level' parameter within the 'get_grouper' function. The function has a conditional block to handle different scenarios based on the type of the 'group_axis', but the implementation within these blocks is incorrect.

When 'level' is not None, the function is attempting to handle the cases differently based on whether 'group_axis' is a MultiIndex or not. However, the implementation is problematic and may lead to errors in certain cases.

The 'level' parameter should be properly validated and processed based on the type of 'group_axis'. Additionally, the segregation of tasks based on the type of 'group_axis' should be revised to ensure correct handling of 'level' and 'key'.

Furthermore, the function may need to be improved to handle MultiIndex cases more effectively and the variable 'keys' needs to be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_grouper' function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj._get_axis(axis).name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name "
                        f"of the {obj._get_axis_name(axis)}"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In this corrected version, the handling of 'level' and 'key' parameters based on the type of 'group_axis' is improved. The conditional blocks have been revised to ensure proper segregation of tasks based on the type of 'group_axis'. These changes should prevent the potential errors and improve the functionality of the function.
