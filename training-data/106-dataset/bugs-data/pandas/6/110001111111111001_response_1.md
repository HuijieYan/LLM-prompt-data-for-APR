The error occurs when the `test_size_period_index` test case tries to group the series by the level "A". Within the `get_grouper` function, there are checks for `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` that determine whether a certain key is part of the object on which the grouping is being performed. The error message indicates a ValueError related to parsing a datetime string, which most likely occurs when attempting to compare a key to an element in the object.

The error occurs because the `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions are not handling the comparison or validation of the keys and objects properly, leading to the program trying to parse a string as a datetime, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic and validation within the `is_in_obj` and `is_in_axis` functions need to be reviewed and adjusted to correctly handle the comparison of keys and objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (other code)

    def is_in_axis(key) -> bool:
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            items = obj.axes[-1]
            if key in items:
                return True
        return False
    
    def is_in_obj(gpr) -> bool:
        if hasattr(gpr, "name"):
            if gpr.name in obj:
                return True
        return False

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the above corrected code, the comparison logic within the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions has been adjusted to properly handle the comparison of keys and objects. This should prevent any ValueError related to parsing datetime strings and fix the bug.
