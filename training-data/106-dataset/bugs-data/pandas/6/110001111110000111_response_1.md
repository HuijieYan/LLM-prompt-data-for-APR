The test case is trying to group a Series by a level in a PeriodIndex, leading to a ValueError stating that the given date string is not likely a datetime.

The potential error location within the get_grouper function is the comparison of the level with the group_axis.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the comparison and manipulation of the level and group_axis when dealing with a PeriodIndex.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add specific handling for PeriodIndex when comparing the level with the group_axis. This can involve checking the type of the group_axis and adjusting the comparison and manipulation of the level accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the get_grouper function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if level is not None and is_period_index(group_axis):
        level_key = group_axis.to_timestamp(freq=level).to_period(level)
        level = None
        key = level_key

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, [key.key], obj

    # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, a new check for the PeriodIndex is added, and if the group_axis is a PeriodIndex, the level is converted to a timestamp, then back to a period before being assigned to the key, and the level is set to None. This adjustment ensures that the comparison and manipulation of the level and group_axis are handled correctly, fixing the bug when grouping by a level in a PeriodIndex.
