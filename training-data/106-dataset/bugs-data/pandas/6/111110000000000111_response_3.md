The error occurs when trying to group by the "A" level of a PeriodIndex. The error message suggests that the given date string is not likely a datetime.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the "get_grouper" function, specifically in the section that handles the grouping process and checks for label-like keys.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the grouping of a PeriodIndex correctly. The error suggests that a date string is not likely a datetime, indicating that the grouping process is encountering issues with the datetime values in the PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle grouping by a PeriodIndex. This may involve updating the logic for handling datetime values, ensuring that the grouping process works correctly with PeriodIndex objects.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_grouper" function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.indexes.category import CategoricalIndex
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    #... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if not isinstance(key, list):  # Check if key is not a list
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # is this an index replacement?
    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        else:
            assert isinstance(obj, Series)
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```
This correction includes potential modifications to the logic of handling keys when grouping and ensuring that the function properly handles the grouping of a PeriodIndex.
