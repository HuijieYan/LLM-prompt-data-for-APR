The error occurs when the function `get_grouper` tries to group a PeriodIndex level, and the code fails to handle this correctly, leading to a ValueError related to date string parsing.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the grouping of PeriodIndex levels properly in the `get_grouper` function. This can be achieved by ensuring that the code correctly identifies the type of index and handles the grouping accordingly.

The issue seems to be arising from how the function handles the PeriodIndex. To fix this, we can modify the `get_grouper` function to properly handle the case when a PeriodIndex level is being grouped. This could involve checking for the type of index and then performing the grouping based on the index type.

Here's the updated/corrected `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (existing code)

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handling grouping for PeriodIndex level
    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        if level is not None:
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name of the {obj._get_axis_name(axis)}"
                    )

        if key is None and level is not None:
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

With this modification, the `get_grouper` function should be able to handle the grouping of PeriodIndex levels correctly and avoid the ValueError related to date string parsing that was occurring previously.
