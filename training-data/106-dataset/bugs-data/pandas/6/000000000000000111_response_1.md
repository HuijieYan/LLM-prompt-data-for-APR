The error originates from the `get_grouper` method in the pandas library. The error message indicates that the given date string is not likely a datetime, and this problem is specifically related to the `PeriodIndex`.

The potential error location within the `get_grouper` method is in its handling of `PeriodIndex` when attempting to group by the level.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code fails to handle `PeriodIndex` appropriately when attempting to group by the level, resulting in a ValueError indicating that the given date string is not likely a datetime.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the code in the `get_grouper` method to accommodate `PeriodIndex` properly when grouping by the level. It should include checks to ensure that the grouping by the level works well with `PeriodIndex`.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_grouper` method:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, MultiIndex, Series, PeriodIndex, Grouper
from pandas._libs import ops
from pandas.api.types import is_list_like, is_scalar
from pandas.core.arrays import Categorical
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_categorical_dtype
from pandas.core.indexes.base import _is_label_like
from pandas.core.indexing import InvalidIndexError
from typing import List, Hashable, Tuple

def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, PeriodIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # rest of the function remains the same
}
```
In the corrected code, special handling for `PeriodIndex` is included, allowing it to work with grouping by the level as intended. This should resolve the issue related to the ValueError when grouping by `PeriodIndex` level.
