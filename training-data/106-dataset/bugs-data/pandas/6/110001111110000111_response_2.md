The error occurs because the function is trying to group by a PeriodIndex level and is encountering a ValueError related to a date string not likely being a datetime.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is with the `is_in_obj` function. In this function, an attempt is made to access a group from the `obj` using its name. This is likely causing the ValueError related to the date string not being likely a datetime, as it tries to compare a string name to a datetime.

The function should be modified to handle the case when the index is a PeriodIndex and address the access of the group by name.

To fix the bug, the `is_in_obj` function needs to be revised to check the type of the index and handle the access of the group by name appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `get_grouper` function:

```python
def get_grouper(
    obj: FrameOrSeries,
    key=None,
    axis: int = 0,
    level=None,
    sort: bool = True,
    observed: bool = False,
    mutated: bool = False,
    validate: bool = True,
    dropna: bool = True,
) -> "Tuple[ops.BaseGrouper, List[Hashable], FrameOrSeries]":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    # if the grouper is obj[name]
    def is_in_obj(gpr) -> bool:
        if not hasattr(gpr, "name"):
            return False
        if isinstance(obj.index, PeriodIndex):
            return gpr == obj.index.name
        else:
            return gpr is obj[gpr.name]

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
```

In the corrected function, the `is_in_obj` function is modified to handle the case when the index is a PeriodIndex. This ensures that the comparison is appropriately handled, preventing the ValueError related to the date string not likely being a datetime.

After making this change, the function should be able to handle the grouping by PeriodIndex level without encountering the ValueError.
