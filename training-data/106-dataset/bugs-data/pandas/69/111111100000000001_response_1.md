Potential error location: The error could occur in the loop where the function checks if the key matches the type of index.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the type checking of the key with respect to the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Add proper checks for the type of the key with respect to the index.
2. Use isinstance() method to check the type of the key.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```
