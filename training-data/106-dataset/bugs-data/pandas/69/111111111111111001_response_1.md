The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method, particularly in the loop where it iterates through the axes and keys. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This implies that the method is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The bug occurs because the method is incorrectly checking whether the index is floating or integer and then comparing it with the key (i) input. The correct approach to fix this bug is to properly handle the case where the index is floating or integer by checking the type of the index and key separately and then performing the required action.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer or non-float index can only have non-integer or non-float indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
- We first check if the index is integer and compare it with the key type. If the index is integer and the key is not an integer, a ValueError is raised.
- Then, we check if the index is a `Float64Index` and compare it with the key type. If the index is a `Float64Index` and the key is not a float, a ValueError is raised.
- If the index is neither an integer nor a float, a generic error message is raised indicating the requirements for indexing on that type of index.
