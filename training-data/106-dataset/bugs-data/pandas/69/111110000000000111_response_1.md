The bug in the `_convert_key` function seems to be related to checking whether the key is an integer or not. The code is using the `is_integer` function without specifying its origin. It should be using `isinstance(i, int)` instead.

The reason behind the bug is that the `is_integer` function is not a built-in function in Python, so it is likely a custom function or a function from a library that is not imported in this scope. Therefore, it is causing an error.

To fix the bug, the code should use the `isinstance(i, int)` function to check whether the key is an integer or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
