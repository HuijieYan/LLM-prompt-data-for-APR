The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the `At` based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers, suggesting that the function is not handling non-integer indexes and indexers properly.

The `key` and `self.obj.axes` are being compared directly without considering their types, which results in the ValueError being raised when a non-integer index is encountered, even though the indexer should be handled differently.

To fix this, we need to check the type of the index and the type of the key during the iteration and perform different checks based on their types. For integer indexes, we should only allow integer indexers, and for non-integer indexes, we should only allow non-integer indexers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to prevent fallback.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Series) and isinstance(i, (int, np.int_)):
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (float, np.float_)) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index and the type of the key during the iteration and performs different checks based on their types. For integer indexes, it only allows integer indexers, and for non-integer indexes, it only allows non-integer indexers.
