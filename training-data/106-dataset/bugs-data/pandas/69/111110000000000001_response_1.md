Potential Error Location: The error may be occurring within the for loop that iterates through the axes and keys to compare their types.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking the type of the index and the keys being passed in. It is assuming that all keys will be of the same type as the index, which may not be the case.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We should modify the function to check the type of each key against the type of the corresponding index, and raise a ValueError if the types do not match.

Corrected Code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
