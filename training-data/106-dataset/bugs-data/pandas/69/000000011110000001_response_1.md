The error occurs when the `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` test case is run. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `_convert_key` method. The error is specifically raised when the function encounters a non-integer index and a non-integer indexer.

The reason behind this bug is that in the `_convert_key` method, the check for non-integer indexers and non-integer indexes is not correctly implemented. The error is likely due to the incorrect comparison or validation logic.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for non-integer indexers and indexes needs to be revised. Additionally, the implementation should include proper type checking and handling for different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes proper type checking and conditional validation to identify integer and non-integer indexers and indexes, addressing the potential cause of the error.
