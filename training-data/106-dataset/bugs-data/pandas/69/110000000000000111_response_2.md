Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the for loop, where it checks if the index is an integer and if the value is an integer.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring because the function is not correctly handling the different types of indexes and values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by properly handling different types of indexes and values in the for loop.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):  # check if the index is an integer index
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # check if the value is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):  # check if the value is an integer and the index is a float index
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
