Potential error location:
The potential error location in the function `_convert_key` is in the `if is_setter` condition where it returns a list of the key irrespective of its type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `if is_setter` condition is returning a list of the key without checking its type, which may not be the intended behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is of the same type as the index. If it's a setter, we should check and convert the key to the appropriate type before returning it.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        # Convert the key to the appropriate type if it's a setter
        if isinstance(key, (int, str)):
            # Convert single key to a list
            return [key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            # Return the key if it's already a list
            return key
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid key type for setter")
    else:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
