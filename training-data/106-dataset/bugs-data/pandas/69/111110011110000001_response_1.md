The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The method is used to convert keys to the same type as the index, but it fails to handle cases where the index holds non-integer values, such as when the index is of type `float64` or `datetime64`. 

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check the type of the index and handle non-integer keys accordingly. For example, if the index holds non-integer values, the method should allow non-integer keys and raise an error for integer keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` method should properly handle cases where the index contains non-integer values, such as float or datetime values.
