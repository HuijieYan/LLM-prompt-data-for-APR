Potential error:
The function is trying to check if the index matches the type of the existing index, but there are some syntax errors and incorrect method calls. Additionally, the function is not handling the case where the key and index are not the same length.

Reason for the bug:
The function contains syntax errors and incorrect method calls. It also lacks handling for cases where the key and index are not the same length.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the length of the key and index and handle cases where they are not the same length.
2. Use the correct method for checking if a value is an integer.
3. Fix the syntax errors in the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # Check for setter
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if len(self.obj.axes) != len(key):
        raise ValueError("Index and key lengths do not match")

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```
