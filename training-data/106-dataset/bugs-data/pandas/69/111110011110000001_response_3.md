The error message indicates that there is an issue with the "At based indexing" when the index is non-integer. This problem arises when using the "at" method to access a non-integer index, and an error is raised because the function is not handling non-integer indices correctly. The function _convert_key is trying to handle the key, but it is not doing so appropriately.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _convert_key function to handle non-integer indices correctly. We should handle non-integer keys appropriately for non-integer indices. The condition checks within the for loop should be adjusted to address this properly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this correction, the _convert_key function should now handle both integer and non-integer indices appropriately, and the issue with the "At based indexing" on a non-integer index should be resolved.
