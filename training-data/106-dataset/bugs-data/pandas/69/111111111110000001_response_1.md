The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that there is a validation check for the key, and if the key is non-integer and the index is non-integer, it should raise a ValueError. However, the bug causes the ValueError to be raised for non-integer keys irrespective of the index type.

To fix this bug, the validation logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified. It should only raise a ValueError if the key is non-integer and the index is non-integer. If the key is non-integer and the index is integer, it should not raise an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly validate the keys based on the index type and raise a ValueError only if the key is non-integer and the index is also non-integer.
