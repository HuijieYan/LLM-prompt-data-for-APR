The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The method checks if the key is an integer or non-integer based on the index type, and it raises a `ValueError` if the key does not match the index type.

The bug occurs because the method is incorrectly evaluating the types of the keys and indexes. It has issues with correctly identifying the integer or non-integer nature of the key or index. This results in the incorrect `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to update the method to correctly identify the integer or non-integer nature of the key and index. This can be done by using a combination of `is_integer()` and `is_float()` methods to accurately identify the nature of the key and index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating() and not ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the method will accurately identify the integer or non-integer nature of the key and index and will raise the appropriate `ValueError` if a mismatch is found.
