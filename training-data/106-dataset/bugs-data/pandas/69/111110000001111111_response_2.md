The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. In this method, there are checks to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. However, the checks for integer and non-integer indexes are not being performed correctly. This is causing issues with Series lookups for Float64Index cases.

The bug occurs because the method is incorrectly checking whether `i` is an integer. The check `if is_integer(i)` should be `if isinstance(i, int)` or `if isinstance(i, float)` to handle both integer and float values. Additionally, the conditions for checking if the index holds integer values are incorrect. The check `if not ax.holds_integer()` should be `if not isinstance(i, int) and ax.holds_integer()` to properly compare the type of the index and the key.

To fix this bug, the conditions in the `_convert_key` method need to be updated to accurately check the type of the index and key. Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the conditions in the `_convert_key` method as described above, the bug affecting Series lookups for Float64Index cases can be resolved.
