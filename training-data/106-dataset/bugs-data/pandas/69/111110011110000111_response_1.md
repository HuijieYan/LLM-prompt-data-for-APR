The error occurs when the `at` method is called on a series with a non-integer index. The `_convert_key` function is responsible for checking the validity of the index and raising an error if it's not appropriate. The error occurs because when invoking `ser.at[4]`, the index is interpreted as an integer, whereas it should be treated as a float to match the behavior of the `loc` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to cast the index to a float when the `is_setter` parameter is false.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    # If the key is not already of type float, cast it to float
    if not isinstance(key, float):
        key = float(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, [key]):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return [key]
```
By casting the index to a float when necessary, we ensure that the behavior of the `at` method matches that of the `loc` method, eliminating the bug in the process.
