The buggy function is designed to convert keys based on certain conditions, such as ensuring that the index type and key type match.

The error message in the original function:
- Checks if the index is an integer and the key is also an integer
- If the index is not an integer, then the key should also not be an integer

Based on the error message, it seems that the function is trying to enforce certain conditions between the index and key values based on their types.

The potential error in the function is that it does not handle non-integer keys correctly.

The key, which is a tuple, is unpacked in a loop, and the value `i` is taken. In the case of integer keys, there is a check for the index type to be integer. However, this check does not handle non-integer keys correctly and may raise a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function should handle non-integer keys appropriately based on the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
               )
    return key
```
