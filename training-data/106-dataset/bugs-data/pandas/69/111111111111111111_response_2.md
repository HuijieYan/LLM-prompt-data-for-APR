The problem lies in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The function is intended to convert keys to the same type as the index, but it currently has issues with handling integer and non-integer indexes. This results in ValueError being raised when using the `at` attribute of the `pandas` Series.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the cases where it should allow arbitrary setting or when the key should match the index type. This is why the ValueError is being raised in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle the different types of indexes appropriately. It should allow arbitrary setting when `is_setter` is True, and it should also check the type of the index and key to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
            
        if isinstance(i, float) and not ax.is_floating():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-float index "
                "can only have float indexers"
            )

    return key
```

With these changes, the function should handle different index types appropriately and resolve the ValueError issues encountered in the test cases.
