The bug in the provided function stems from the improper use of the is_integer() and holds_integer() methods. These methods are being called directly on the ax variable, which represents an individual axis of the object, rather than on the elements of the axis.

To fix this bug, we need to iterate through the elements of the axis and apply the is_integer() and holds_integer() methods to each element. Additionally, we should check if the key is an integer or not based on the type of the elements in the axis.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, k in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        for i in k:
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            if not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, complex)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected function, we iterate through each axis and verify the type of indices in the key. If the axis is of integer type, we check if the index is an integer; otherwise, we check if the index is not an integer.

This approach ensures that we properly handle different types of indices based on the type of the axis.

This correction addresses the issue of improper usage of is_integer() and holds_integer() methods, and it handles the different types of indices more accurately.
