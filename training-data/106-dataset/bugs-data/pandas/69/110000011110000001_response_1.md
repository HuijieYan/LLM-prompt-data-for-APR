The error message indicates that there is an issue with the "_convert_key" function. Specifically, it is raising a ValueError concerning the indexing when the key is non-integer. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the "for" loop where it checks whether the key is an integer or not. This is where the ValueError is being raised.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling non-integer keys properly. It is raising a ValueError instead of handling the non-integer keys gracefully.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle non-integer keys properly. This can be achieved by validating the type of the key and distinguishing between integer and non-integer types. Based on this validation, the function should handle the keys accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected function, we added "isinstance(i, int)" checks to properly handle non-integer keys and raise the appropriate error messages.
