Potential Error:
The function is checking if the indexer contains an integer or non-integer value based on the axis type. However, the function uses a method `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` which are not standard methods in Python.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to call non-existent methods for checking integer and non-integer values.

Possible Approach:
We need to change the way the function checks for integer and non-integer values by using built-in Python functions or methods.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
