The error is occurring because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the non-integer indexers properly. Specifically, when the indexer is non-integer, the function is raising a `ValueError` instead of allowing non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes. This is evident in the error message as it states "ValueError: At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to allow non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes. This can be achieved by modifying the condition for non-integer indexes to allow non-integer indexers without raising an error.

The corrected `_convert_key` function is provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Allow non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes
            if not ax.holds_integer():
                continue
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle both integer and non-integer indexers based on the type of the index, resolving the bug and allowing the test case to pass successfully.
