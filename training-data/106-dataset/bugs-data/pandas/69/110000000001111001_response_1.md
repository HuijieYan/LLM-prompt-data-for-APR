The issue with the code seems to be that the type of the index and the type of the key are not being checked properly. The function is supposed to validate whether the key and index are of the same type, but the current implementation has several issues such as incorrect attribute/method names (`is_integer`, `holds_integer`, `is_floating`) and checking for the wrong conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, str, int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an datetime index "
                    "can only have datetime-like indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, str, int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an timedelta index "
                    "can only have timedelta-like indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

In the provided cases, we are checking if the index is either a DateTimeIndex or a TimedeltaIndex, and based on that, we are validating the type of the key. This approach should address the issues and provide correct validation for the keys based on the index type.
