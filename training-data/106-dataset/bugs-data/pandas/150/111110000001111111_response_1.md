The function is expected to return True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs in corresponding locations. False otherwise.

# Issue with the function
The function is excessively complex and has unclear variable and operation names. It is not properly handling the comparison of arrays, especially when dealing with NaN values. The code complexity is prone to logical errors, making it difficult to understand and debug.

# Reason behind the occurrence of the bug
1. The function is not handling NaN values explicitly, leading to incorrect comparisons when NaNs are present.
2. The function is not structured in an easy-to-understand format, making it challenging to identify and resolve issues.

# Possible approaches for fixing the bug
1. Implement explicit handling of NaN values by checking for NaN using np.isnan() function.
2. Simplify the structure of the function to enhance readability and maintainability.
3. Use more descriptive variable names to improve code understanding.
4. Identify and remove unnecessary or redundant code.

# Corrected code
```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)  # Check if arrays are equal regardless of NaNs

    is_nan_left = np.isnan(left)
    is_nan_right = np.isnan(right)

    if not np.array_equal(is_nan_left, is_nan_right):  # Check if NaNs are in corresponding locations
        return False

    # Remove NaNs from the arrays for comparison
    left_no_nan = left[~is_nan_left]
    right_no_nan = right[~is_nan_right]

    return np.array_equal(left_no_nan, right_no_nan)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The function checks for NaN values explicitly and handles strict NaN comparison if needed.
2. It follows a more straightforward approach to compare arrays considering NaNs and their positions.
3. The structure and variable names are simplified for better clarity.
