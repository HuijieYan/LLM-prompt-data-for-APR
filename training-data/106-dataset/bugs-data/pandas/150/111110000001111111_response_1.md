The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it checks for the object arrays and compares each element in a loop.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation is not handling the comparison of object arrays in the correct manner. It is also not correctly handling arrays of different shapes.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the two arrays element-wise and make sure they have the same shape before making any comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(left.dtype) or pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(right.dtype):
        if not strict_nan:
            return (pd.array_equal(pd.Series(left.ravel()), pd.Series(right.ravel())))

        return (np.array_equal(left, right))

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
