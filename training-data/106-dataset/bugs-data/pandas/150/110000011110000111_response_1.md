The error occurs because the comparison `left_value != right_value` returns an array instead of a single boolean value. This happens when comparing NumPy arrays, and the function does not handle this properly.

The potential error location is the comparison `left_value != right_value` inside the for loop.

The error occurs because the comparison of two arrays with `!=` returns another array of boolean values, and when Python tries to evaluate the truth value of this array, it raises a ValueError because it's ambiguous.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the arrays `left` and `right` element-wise.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.array_equal(left, right) and not np.any(np.not_equal(left, right))
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This corrected code uses `np.array_equal` to handle comparisons for all types of arrays with different data types and resolves the issue of returning ambiguous truth values.
