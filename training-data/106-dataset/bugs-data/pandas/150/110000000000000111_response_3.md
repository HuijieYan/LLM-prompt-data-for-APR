Potential Error Location: The bug may be occurring in the section that checks for Object arrays and string dtypes, as well as the section that checks for NaNs in float and complex arrays.

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. The code does not properly handle object arrays, string dtypes, and NaNs in float and complex arrays.
2. The logic for comparing NaNs and None in the object arrays may not be accurate.
3. The code does not handle date-like vs integer comparison.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use numpy functions to handle NaN comparisons in float and complex arrays.
2. Handle the comparison of object arrays and string dtypes separately.
3. Add a condition to handle date-like vs integer comparison.

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

        return False
