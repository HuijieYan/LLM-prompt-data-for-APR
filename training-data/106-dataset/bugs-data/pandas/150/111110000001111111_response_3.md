Based on the inputs and expected outputs, the function `array_equivalent` is expected to compare two numpy arrays and return True if their elements are equal and False otherwise. However, the current implementation contains several issues:

1. The function refers to objects or functions such as `is_string_dtype`, `is_float_dtype`, `is_complex_dtype`, `isna`, `is_datetimelike_v_numeric`, `needs_i8_conversion`, etc., which are not defined in the provided code. Therefore, the current implementation will raise NameError or AttributeError due to undefined references.

2. The function contains conditional checking for different data types, which may lead to incorrect comparisons and potentially incorrect results.

3. The function implementation is overly complex and incomprehensible, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

To fix the issues, the function needs to be simplified and rewritten with clear logic for array comparison without relying on undefined references.

Here's the corrected and simplified function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # Compare shapes
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Compare non-NaN elements
    if np.any(np.isnan(left) != np.isnan(right)):
        return False

    # Compare non-NaN values for equivalence
    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left[~np.isnan(left)], right[~np.isnan(right)])
    else:
        return np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))
```

This corrected implementation avoids unnecessary complexity and provides a clear logic for comparing arrays and handling NaN values. The usage of NumPy's built-in functions simplifies the comparison process and addresses the issues present in the original implementation.
