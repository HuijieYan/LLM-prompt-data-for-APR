The problem in the function `array_equivalent` seems to arise from the comparison of two numpy arrays `left` and `right` with the option `strict_nan=True`. The function is designed to compare if two arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. The buggy function does not handle the comparison correctly when the arrays have multiple dimensions or different shapes.

The function starts by converting the `left` and `right` parameters into numpy arrays using `np.asarray`. Then it checks for shape incompatibility, and if that's true, it returns `False` which is the correct behavior. After that, it proceeds to handle different data types including object arrays, string dtypes, float dtypes, complex dtypes, datetimelike vs numeric comparisons, and structured dtypes.

However, in some cases, it may not correctly handle comparisons between object arrays in multi-dimensional arrays, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic for object arrays in multi-dimensional arrays needs to be updated. It's important to ensure that element-wise comparison and handling of NaN values are correctly handled even for multi-dimensional arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compatibility
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) and np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
        # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
        for idx, val in np.ndenumerate(left):
            if not _compare_elements(val, right[idx], strict_nan):
                return False
        return True
    else:
        # Handle other data type comparisons
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

def _compare_elements(val1, val2, strict_nan):
    if strict_nan:
        return val1 == val2
    else:
        if ((val1 is None or val1 != val1) and (val2 is None or val2 != val2)):
            return True
        else:
            return val1 == val2
```

In the corrected code, we define a separate method `_compare_elements` to handle the comparison of individual elements. This method handles the comparison of elements in object arrays, taking into account the presence of NaN and None values. The `array_equivalent` function then uses this method to compare each element of the arrays. If the element-wise comparison is satisfied for all elements, the function returns `True`, indicating that the arrays are equivalent based on the specified criteria.
