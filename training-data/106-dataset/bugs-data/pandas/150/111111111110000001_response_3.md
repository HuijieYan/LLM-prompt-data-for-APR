The error message indicates that there is a ValueError due to ambiguity in the truth value of an array with more than one element. This error is likely occurring when comparing the `left_value` and `right_value` arrays in the `array_equivalent` function.

The potential error is in the comparison of NumPy arrays using the `!=` operator, which can lead to ambiguous truth values when comparing arrays with more than one element.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison of NumPy arrays directly using the `!=` operator can result in ambiguous truth values. 

To fix the bug, the comparison of arrays should be performed using the `np.array_equal` function, which is designed to compare arrays element-wise and return a single boolean value as the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.api.types as pd_types

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if pd_types.is_object_dtype(left) or pd_types.is_object_dtype(right):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        return (left == right).all()

    if pd_types.is_float_dtype(left) or pd_types.is_complex_dtype(left):
        return ((left == right) | (pd_types.isna(left) & pd_types.isna(right))).all()

    if pd_types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(left) and pd_types.is_numeric(right):
        return False

    if pd_types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(left) and pd_types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(right):
        return pd_types.is_dtype_equal(left.dtype, right.dtype) and (left == right).all()

    if pd_types.is_timedelta64_dtype(left) and pd_types.is_numeric_dtype(right):
        return False

    if pd_types.is_timedelta64_dtype(left) and pd_types.is_timedelta64_dtype(right):
        return pd_types.is_dtype_equal(left.dtype, right.dtype) and (left == right).all()

    return pd_types.is_dtype_equal(left.dtype, right.dtype) and np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected code, the comparisons are performed using the appropriate functions provided by NumPy and pandas to avoid ambiguity in the truth values of array comparisons. Additionally, the necessary imports for NumPy and pandas have been included in the corrected code.
