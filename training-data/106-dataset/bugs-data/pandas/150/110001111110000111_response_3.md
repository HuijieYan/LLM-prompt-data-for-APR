The error message indicates that there is a ValueError because the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. This is likely occurring in the comparison `if left_value != right_value`. It seems that this comparison is not handling NumPy arrays properly.

The bug is likely occurring because the function `array_equivalent` is not handling NumPy arrays correctly. When comparing arrays, it's necessary to use NumPy's comparison methods to handle the comparison of arrays. It seems that the comparison `if left_value != right_value` is not handling the comparison of arrays properly and is leading to the ambiguous truth value error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of arrays within the function `array_equivalent` to properly handle NumPy arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if not np.array_equal(left, right):
        return False

    return True
```

In this corrected implementation, we use `np.array_equal` to check if the arrays `left` and `right` are equal, handling arrays properly. This should resolve the issue and prevent the ambiguous truth value error.
