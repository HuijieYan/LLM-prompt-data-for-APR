The buggy function is `array_equivalent`, whose purpose is to compare two NumPy arrays element-wise and return True if the arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations, False otherwise.

Given the input values, it appears that the function should compare two arrays element-wise. The bug likely occurs in the comparison and handling of NaN elements.

The code seems to have issues when comparing arrays with NaN values. It's comparing each element individually and returning False if the same indices contain different values, or True if all values are the same, including NaNs. This approach is not suitable for comparing arrays containing NaNs.

To fix this, we should use `np.isnan` to test for NaN elements and then compare the arrays in a manner that correctly handles NaNs.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if strict_nan:
        # strict_nan comparison
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        # non-strict_nan comparison
        return np.all(np.isclose(left, right, equal_nan=True))
```

In this fixed code, the `np.isclose` function is used to compare the arrays with the `equal_nan` parameter set to True, which correctly handles NaN values in the arrays. If `strict_nan` is True, it uses `np.array_equal` to perform an element-wise comparison without considering NaNs.
