The buggy function is designed to check if two arrays have equivalent non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. The function has multiple conditional checks based on the data type of the input arrays and handles cases of string dtypes, float dtypes, datetime-like vs numeric comparisons, and structured dtypes. The function iterates over the elements of the arrays to compare and check for NaN values.

In the first two buggy cases, the function returns incorrect results when comparing arrays with equal elements but different shapes. This indicates a problem with the shape comparison logic in the function.

In the third buggy case, the function encounters an error due to a comparison between arrays with different shapes and dtypes.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the shapes of the input arrays are equal. If the shapes are not equal, the function should return False. This check should be placed at the beginning of the function to ensure that the shapes of the input arrays are compatible for further comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # rest of the original function logic
    ...
```

With the correction, the function now checks for shape compatibility at the beginning and returns False if the shapes of the input arrays are not equal. This ensures that the comparison of non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations is performed only when the arrays have compatible shapes.
