The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` compares two arrays `left` and `right` using the `array_equivalent` function. The error message indicates that the error is occurring in the comparison of `left_value` and `right_value` within the `array_equivalent` function due to the ambiguous truth value of an array with more than one element.

The potential error location within the `array_equivalent` function is the comparison of `left_value` and `right_value` using the `!=` operator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `!=` operator is trying to compare arrays rather than individual elements, causing ambiguity in the truth value.

To fix the bug, the `!=` operator should be replaced with the `np.array_equal` function to compare the equality of the entire arrays of `left_value` and `right_value`.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right):

        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return lib.array_equivalent_object(
                ensure_object(left.ravel()), ensure_object(right.ravel())
            )

        for left_value, right_value in zip(left, right):
            if left_value is NaT and right_value is not NaT:
                return False

            elif isinstance(left_value, float) and np.isnan(left_value):
                if not isinstance(right_value, float) or not np.isnan(right_value):
                    return False
            else:
                if not np.array_equal(left_value, right_value):
                    return False
        return True

    # (other conditions as before...)
    # ...
```
In this corrected function, the comparison of `left_value` and `right_value` within the loop has been replaced with `np.array_equal` to compare the entire arrays, resolving the ambiguity in the truth value.
