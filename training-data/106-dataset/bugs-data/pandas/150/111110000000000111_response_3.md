Potential error location: The function seems to handle comparison and equivalence of arrays, particularly handling NaN and None values. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The function does not handle the comparison of NaN and None values properly according to the given test case.
2. The code seems to have redundant or unnecessary checks for different data types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic to properly handle NaN and None values according to the "strict_nan" parameter.
2. Simplify and optimize the code by removing redundant or unnecessary checks for different data types.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    """
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    return np.all(np.isclose(left, right, equal_nan=True))
```
