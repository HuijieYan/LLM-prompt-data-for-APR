Sure, here is the full code of the fixed function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    # convert input arrays to numpy arrays
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    # handling comparison of object arrays with strict NaN comparison
    for i in range(left.shape[0]):
        for j in range(left.shape[1]):
            left_value = left[i, j]
            right_value = right[i, j]

            if left_value != right_value:
                if ((left_value is None and right_value is not None) or
                        (np.isnan(left_value) and not np.isnan(right_value))):
                    return False
    return True
```

This corrected function handles the comparison of arrays with different datatypes, including object arrays, while also considering strict NaN comparison as specified.
