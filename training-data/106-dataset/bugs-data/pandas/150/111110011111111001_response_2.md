The error occurs in the comparison of `left_value` and `right_value` within the `array_equivalent` function. The comparison `if left_value != right_value` is problematic because it results in a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error is raised because `left_value` and `right_value` are NumPy arrays, and the comparison is not well-defined for arrays.

To fix this issue, the comparison should be modified to compare the arrays element-wise rather than using the direct equality comparison. One approach to fix this is to use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the arrays, which ensures that each element of the arrays is compared individually.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In this corrected function, the comparison of arrays is done using the `np.array_equal` function, which compares the arrays element-wise and returns `True` if they are equivalent. This approach resolves the ambiguity and ensures that the comparison is well-defined for arrays.
