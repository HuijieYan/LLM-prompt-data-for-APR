The test case is calling the `array_equivalent` function with the `strict_nan` parameter set to `True`. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError related to the comparison of array elements in the function.

The potential error location is within the section where the function handles `Object` arrays (`is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right)`). This is because the function checks for the equality of array elements using the equality operator (`==`), which returns an array of boolean values, and the single boolean array cannot be directly evaluated as a truthy or falsy value. This results in the ValueError.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is comparing entire arrays for equality and expecting a single boolean result, rather than comparing individual elements and aggregating the results.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the code to compare individual elements within the arrays for equality and aggregate the results using a logical operation such as `all()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    if left.dtype == object and right.dtype == object:
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.all(left == right)
        else:
            return np.all(np.equal(left, right) | (pd.isna(left) & pd.isna(right)))

    # continue with the rest of the code to handle other dtype comparisons
    # ...

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `np.all()` to check if all the elements are equal or if the NaN values match when `strict_nan` is True.
- The comparison of object arrays and handling of strict_nan flag is done separately to ensure the correct comparison behavior.
