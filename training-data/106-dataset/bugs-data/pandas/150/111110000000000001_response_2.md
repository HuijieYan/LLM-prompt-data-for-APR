Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the section of code that deals with comparing object arrays (including strings, NaN, and None) and float/complex arrays containing NaNs.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
1. The code does not handle the comparison of NaN and None properly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The code does not handle the comparison of NaN values in float and complex arrays correctly, resulting in incorrect results.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to properly handle the comparison of NaN and None, considering the strict_nan parameter.
2. Revise the code to correctly compare NaN values in float and complex arrays, taking into account the behavior of NaN in NumPy arrays.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):

        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

        for left_value, right_value in zip(left.ravel(), right.ravel()):
            if left_value is None and right_value is not None:
                return False

            elif isinstance(left_value, float) and np.isnan(left_value):
                if not (isinstance(right_value, float) and np.isnan(right_value)):
                    return False
            else:
                if left_value != right_value:
                    return False
        return True

    # NaN comparison for float and complex arrays
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.complexfloating):
        return np.array_equal(left, right) or (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right)).all()

    # Handle other data types
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
