The error message indicates that there is a ValueError because the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. This error is being raised at line 448 of the missing.py file.

The issue is likely with the comparison of arrays using the `==` operator, which can result in an array of boolean values, causing the ambiguity when evaluating the truth value.

To fix this issue, we can modify the comparison to use the `np.array_equal` function, which checks whether two arrays are equal, element-wise.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if not np.array_equal(left, right):
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return True

    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating):
        if np.isnan(left).all() != np.isnan(right).all():
            return False
    
    return True
```
