The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised at line 448 of the missing.py file, specifically in the `array_equivalent` function. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" suggests that there is an issue with comparing the truth value of arrays with multiple elements.

Upon further examination, it seems that the issue is with the comparison process in the `array_equivalent` function. The comparison `if left_value != right_value:` is responsible for the ambiguous truth value error because it is trying to compare arrays directly, which is not the expected behavior.

Since the issue is with the comparison process, the possible approaches for fixing the bug could include using the `np.array_equal` method or checking for equality element-wise using the `np.all` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.
    
    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.object_) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.object_):
    
        if not strict_nan:
