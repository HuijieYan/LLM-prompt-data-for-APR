Potential error location: The function seems to have issues with comparing and handling NaN values in NumPy arrays.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not properly handling NaN values and comparing arrays with NaN values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use numpy's isnan function to check for NaN values in arrays.
2. Use numpy's array_equal function to compare arrays with NaN values.

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right) or (np.isnan(left) == np.isnan(right)).all()
