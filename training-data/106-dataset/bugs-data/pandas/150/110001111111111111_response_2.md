The error message occurs when the `array_equivalent` function is called with the `left` and `right` arrays. The error specifically mentions that the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous, and it suggests using `a.any()` or `a.all()` to address this ambiguity.

Looking at the `array_equivalent` function, the potential error location seems to be in the following line:

```python
if left_value != right_value:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison `left_value != right_value` is resulting in an ambiguous truth value due to the arrays `left_value` and `right_value` potentially containing multiple elements.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `np.array_equal` function provided by NumPy to compare the arrays `left` and `right`. This can address the ambiguity in truth value and ensure that the comparison is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison has been replaced with the `np.array_equal` function, which compares the two arrays `left` and `right` and returns `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. This approach simplifies the comparison and avoids the ambiguity in truth value.
