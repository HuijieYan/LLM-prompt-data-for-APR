The test case is calling the function `array_equivalent` with two numpy arrays `left` and `right`. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the comparison of the arrays. It specifically mentions that the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.

The potential error location within the function `array_equivalent` is likely in the section where comparisons are being made between elements of the arrays `left` and `right`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison between the elements of the arrays `left` and `right` is not being handled correctly. When comparing arrays, the function is not using `np.any()` or `np.all()` to make the comparison unambiguous.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the code to use `np.any()` or `np.all()` for the comparisons in the relevant section. This will ensure that the truth value of the array is unambiguous and the comparison is done correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the function `array_equivalent`:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if not np.array_equal(left, right):
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right):

        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return lib.array_equivalent_object(
                ensure_object(left.ravel()), ensure_object(right.ravel())
            )

        for left_value, right_value in zip(left.ravel(), right.ravel()):
            if left_value is NaT and right_value is not NaT:
                return False

            elif isinstance(left_value, float) and np.isnan(left_value):
                if not isinstance(right_value, float) or not np.isnan(right_value):
                    return False
            else:
                if left_value != right_value:
                    return False
        return True

    # NaNs can occur in float and complex arrays.
    if is_float_dtype(left) or is_complex_dtype(left):

        # empty
        if not (np.prod(left.shape) and np.prod(right.shape)):
            return True
        return np.all((left == right) | (isna(left) & isna(right)))

    # numpy will not allow this type of datetimelike vs integer comparison
    elif is_datetimelike_v_numeric(left, right):
        return False

    # M8/m8
    elif needs_i8_conversion(left) and needs_i8_conversion(right):
        if not is_dtype_equal(left.dtype, right.dtype):
            return False

        left = left.view("i8")
        right = right.view("i8")

    # if we have structured dtypes, compare first
    if left.dtype.type is np.void or right.dtype.type is np.void:
        if left.dtype != right.dtype:
            return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected code, the comparisons are now using `np.all()` to ensure that the truth value of the array is unambiguous. This should fix the bug that was causing the error.
