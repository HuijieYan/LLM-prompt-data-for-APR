The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is asserting the output of the `array_equivalent` function, which is expecting a boolean output. However, the error message indicates that the function is returning an ambiguous truth value error.

The potential error location seems to be when comparing the array values using `if left_value != right_value`. This comparison can return an array of boolean values, and trying to evaluate the truth value of such an array can lead to the ambiguous truth value error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison of array values is resulting in an array of boolean values rather than a single boolean value. This is likely happening because the comparison is being made between arrays directly.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the `np.array_equal` function provided by NumPy to compare the entire arrays `left` and `right` instead of comparing their elements using conditional statements.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function incorporating the suggested approach:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This simplifies the `array_equivalent` function by directly comparing the entire arrays using the `np.array_equal` function, eliminating the need for manual element-wise comparisons.
