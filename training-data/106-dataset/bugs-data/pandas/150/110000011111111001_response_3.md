The error message indicates that the issue is occurring when comparing the `left_value` and `right_value` arrays inside the `array_equivalent` function. Specifically, the error message "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" suggests that the comparison of arrays is returning an array instead of a single boolean value.

The bug is likely occurring due to the comparison of entire arrays using the `!=` operator, which results in an array of boolean values instead of a single boolean result.

To fix the bug, the comparison of arrays should be done element-wise. This can be achieved using the `np.array_equal` function for element-wise comparison of arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    # Convert input arrays to NumPy arrays
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # Check if shapes are compatible
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Perform element-wise comparison of arrays
    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

With this correction, the `array_equivalent` function will perform an element-wise comparison of arrays and return `True` if the arrays are equivalent, and `False` otherwise.
