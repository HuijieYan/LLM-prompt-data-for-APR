The error occurs when the `array_equivalent` function compares two arrays with different shapes. This is indicated by the line `if left.shape != right.shape:` in the `array_equivalent` function. The comparison should be done element-wise, rather than directly comparing the shapes.

The error message also indicates that the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. This suggests that a comparison operation is being performed on arrays directly, which is not well-defined in this context.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the arrays are compared and avoid using direct comparison operators. Instead, we should compare each element of the arrays to check if they are equal.

Here's the corrected `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    # Compare each element of the arrays for equality
    comparison = (left == right)
    
    # If strict_nan is True, consider NaN and None to be different
    if strict_nan:
        comparison = comparison & ~((left is None) & (right is None))
    
    return comparison.all()
```

In this corrected version, we use the `equality` operator on the arrays directly to compare each element. We also consider the `strict_nan` parameter to adjust the comparison accordingly. Then, we use the `all` method to ensure that all the elements in the comparison result are True, indicating that all elements are equal.
