The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is designed to compare two numpy arrays using the `array_equivalent` function. The function is expected to return `True` if the arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations, and `False` otherwise.

The error occurs when comparing the `left_value` and `right_value` arrays within the `array_equivalent` function. The comparison `if left_value != right_value` attempts to compare arrays directly, resulting in a ValueError because the truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison is being performed element-wise between arrays, leading to the ValueError. To fix this issue, the comparison should be done using `all` or `any` methods to obtain a single boolean result.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # Perform the correct comparison
    return np.all(left == right) if not strict_nan else np.all(np.equal(left, right))
```

In the corrected code, the `np.all` method is used to perform an element-wise comparison and return a single boolean result, ensuring that the comparison can handle arrays with more than one element.
