The error occurs because the comparison `left_value != right_value` in the `array_equivalent` function returns an array of boolean values, and it's not clear how to interpret the truth value of an array with more than one element. This is due to a comparison operation between two NumPy arrays, which results in an array of boolean values. The comparison operation `left_value != right_value` should return a single boolean value.

To fix this bug, you can iterate through the elements of the `left` and `right` arrays and compare them element-wise. This can be done using a loop or by using NumPy's array comparison operations to generate a boolean array and then use `.all()` or `.any()` to get a single boolean result.

Here's the corrected `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return (left == right).all()

    # Object arrays
    for left_row, right_row in zip(left, right):
        for j in range(len(left_row)):
            left_value = left_row[j]
            right_value = right_row[j]
            if left_value is np.nan and right_value is not np.nan:
                return False
            elif isinstance(left_value, float) and np.isnan(left_value):
                if not (isinstance(right_value, float) and np.isnan(right_value)):
                    return False
            elif left_value != right_value:
                return False
    return True
```

In this corrected function:
- We first check if the shapes of the input arrays are the same. If not, we return False.
- If `strict_nan` is not `True`, we use a direct comparison and return whether all elements are equal using `(left == right).all()`.
- If `strict_nan` is `True`, we iterate through each element of the arrays using a loop and compare them. If any element mismatches or if one has NaN and the other doesn't, we return False. Otherwise, we return True at the end.

This corrected code should fix the bug and produce the expected behavior for the `array_equivalent` function.
