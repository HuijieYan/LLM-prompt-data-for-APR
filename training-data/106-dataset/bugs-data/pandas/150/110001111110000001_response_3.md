1. The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is checking the `array_equivalent` function with arrays containing nested arrays of integers.

2. The potential error location within the `array_equivalent` function is in the section where it compares elements of the input arrays `left` and `right`.

3. The error message indicates that the comparison of the arrays `left` and `right` is ambiguous due to the truth value of an array with more than one element. This suggests that the comparison operation is being applied to entire arrays instead of individual elements.

4. To fix the bug, we can iterate over the nested arrays using nested loops and compare individual elements in the `left` and `right` arrays.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    for i in range(left.shape[0]):
        for j in range(left.shape[1]):
            left_value, right_value = left[i, j], right[i, j]
            if isinstance(left_value, float) and np.isnan(left_value):
                if not (isinstance(right_value, float) and np.isnan(right_value)):
                    return False
            elif left_value is not right_value:
                return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code, we use nested loops to compare individual elements within the nested arrays. This ensures that we compare each element in the `left` and `right` arrays properly, addressing the ambiguity in the comparison and fixing the bug.
