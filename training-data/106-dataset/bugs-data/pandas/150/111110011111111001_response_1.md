The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is calling the `array_equivalent` function with two NumPy arrays as input parameters, along with the `strict_nan` parameter set to `True`.

The error message indicates that the issue arises from the comparison operation within the `array_equivalent` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be the comparison operations, especially when dealing with arrays to compare their elements.

The error occurs because the comparison returns an array of boolean values, and the subsequent attempt to evaluate this array in a boolean context is ambiguous, leading to the ValueError. To address this, the comparison operations should be properly handled within the function.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to use the `np.array_equal` function provided by NumPy to compare the arrays. This function compares the shapes and elements of the input arrays and returns a single boolean value indicating if they are equal.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

By using `np.array_equal`, the function will properly compare the arrays and return a single boolean value, resolving the ambiguous truth value issue.
