The error message "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" indicates that there is a comparison of arrays 'left' and 'right' directly instead of using '.any()' or '.all()' to consider all elements of the arrays. This error occurs within the 'array_equivalent' function.

In the 'array_equivalent' function, the comparison of arrays 'left' and 'right' is directly performed at one point, which is causing the ValueError. This happens because the arrays contain multiple elements and the comparison operation does not know how to handle this comparison at once.

To fix the bug, the comparison between 'left' and 'right' arrays should be modified to use '.any()' or '.all()' to consider all elements of the arrays.

Here's the corrected 'array_equivalent' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if not np.array_equal(left, right):
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    if not strict_nan:
        return (left.ravel() == right.ravel()).all()
    else:
        return (left.ravel() == right.ravel()).any()
```
