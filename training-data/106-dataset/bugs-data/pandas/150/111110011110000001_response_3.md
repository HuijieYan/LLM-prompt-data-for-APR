The error message is indicating a ValueError related to the comparison of arrays in the `array_equivalent` function. The code is attempting to directly compare two NumPy arrays, which can result in ambiguous truth values due to the presence of multiple elements.

The potential error location in the `array_equivalent` function is the comparison of arrays when checking for equivalent non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison of arrays is not handled properly. The comparison between arrays is not straightforward and can lead to ambiguous truth values.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to use the `.all()` method for the comparison between arrays in the `array_equivalent` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Check if the arrays are equivalent using the .all() method
    return (left == right).all()
```

In the corrected code, the comparison between `left` and `right` arrays is performed using the `.all()` method to ensure that all elements are compared and the result is not ambiguous. This should resolve the ValueError related to comparing arrays with more than one element.
