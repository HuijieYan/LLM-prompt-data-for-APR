The bug occurs in the `array_equivalent` function when comparing arrays of object dtype or string dtype. The comparison logic for NaN values and non-NaN values is incorrect.

In the first buggy case, the left_value and right_value are arrays of the same values, but the comparison logic fails to return True.

In the second buggy case, the left_value and right_value are different, but the comparison logic does not account for this difference.

In the third buggy case, the shapes of left and right are different, leading to unexpected behavior during comparison.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic needs to be modified to correctly handle arrays of object dtype and string dtype. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the shapes of the input arrays are different.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Convert the arrays to string representations and then compare
    if np.array2string(left) == np.array2string(right):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
