The potential error location within the problematic function is with the comparison of NaN values. The function does not handle NaN values correctly which leads to incorrect results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the comparison of NaN values, especially when the arrays contain NaNs in different locations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use numpy's `np.isnan()` function to check for NaN values in the arrays. We can also simplify the logic for comparing the arrays and handling NaN values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if not np.array_equal(left.shape, right.shape):
        return False

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    return np.array_equal(np.isnan(left), np.isnan(right)) and np.array_equal(np.nan_to_num(left), np.nan_to_num(right))
```
