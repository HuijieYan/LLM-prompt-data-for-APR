The error occurs because the code is attempting to compare arrays directly using the '!=' operator, which results in a ValueError when used with arrays. The comparison `if left_value != right_value:` is causing the issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to perform element-wise comparison using `np.array_equal()` instead of directly comparing arrays using operators.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    return np.all(np.where(np.isnan(left), np.isnan(right), left == right))
```

In this corrected implementation, `np.array_equal()` is used to check if two arrays are equal, and `np.all()` is used to check if all elements in the resulting array are True using element-wise comparison. This ensures that the comparison works correctly for arrays and avoids the ValueError that occurred in the buggy code.
