The error message indicates a ValueError: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This error commonly occurs when trying to use a boolean expression on arrays or when comparing arrays element-wise.

The potential error location is within the code block that checks for equality between elements of the left and right arrays: 
```python
else:
    if left_value != right_value:
        return False
```

The error occurs when comparing arrays element-wise. Instead of directly comparing the arrays, we should consider using numpy's array functions such as `np.array_equal` and other array comparison methods.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic by using numpy's array comparison functions and avoid direct element-wise comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the array_equivalent function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    
    for left_value, right_value in zip(left.ravel(), right.ravel()):
        if (np.isnan(left_value) and not np.isnan(right_value)) or (not np.isnan(left_value) and np.isnan(right_value)):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This modified code utilizes NumPy's array comparison methods such as np.array_equal, and handles NaN comparisons as well as strict_nan checks.
