The error occurs when the `array_equivalent` function is called with the `strict_nan` parameter set to `True`. The error message "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" suggests that there is an issue with comparing arrays with multiple elements when `strict_nan` is set to `True`.

The issue lies in the section of the code where it checks for `is_string_dtype`. The current implementation is not handling the comparison of arrays with multiple elements correctly when `strict_nan` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic of arrays when `strict_nan` is set to `True`. We can iterate over the elements of the arrays and compare each pair of elements iteratively. If any pair of elements is not equal, we can return `False`. If all pairs are equal, we can return `True` at the end.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if is_string_dtype(left) or is_string_dtype(right):
        if not strict_nan:
            return lib.array_equivalent_object(
                ensure_object(left.ravel()), ensure_object(right.ravel())
            )
            
        for l, r in zip(left.flat, right.flat):
            if l is not r and not (np.isnan(l) and np.isnan(r)):
                return False
        return True
    # remaining code...
```
