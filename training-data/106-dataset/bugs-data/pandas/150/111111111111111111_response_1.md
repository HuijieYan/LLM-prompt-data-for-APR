The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison operation performed inside the `array_equivalent` function. Specifically, the error "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" suggests that there is a comparison between arrays of unequal lengths and the comparison operation is ambiguous.

Upon analyzing the `array_equivalent` function, it seems that the issue might be occurring in the section where the function tries to compare `left_value` and `right_value` inside the loop. The comparison `if left_value != right_value` can result in a ValueError if `left_value` and `right_value` are arrays of non-matching shapes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the strict comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` does not account for the possibility that these values could be arrays themselves.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where `left_value` and `right_value` are arrays. One approach is to use the `np.array_equal()` function to compare arrays for equality.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right) or (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right)).all()
```

This revised function uses the `np.array_equal` function to compare the entire arrays for equality. It also considers NaN comparison based on the `strict_nan` flag using the logical AND operation.
