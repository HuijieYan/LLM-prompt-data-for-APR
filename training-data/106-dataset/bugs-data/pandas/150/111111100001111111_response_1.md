The problematic function `array_equivalent` compares two arrays `left` and `right` element-wise. It checks for equality of non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. However, there is no return statement in the function which returns `None` by default.

The `array_equivalent` function is supposed to compare two NumPy arrays and determine if they are equivalent based on the specified conditions. However, the function lacks a proper implementation to return the comparison results.

To fix the bug, implement the logic to compare the two arrays and return the result as a boolean value.

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_string_dtype, is_float_dtype, is_complex_dtype, is_datetimelike_v_numeric, needs_i8_conversion, needs_i8_conversion, is_dtype_equal

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if not (np.array_equal(left.shape, right.shape) and left.dtype == right.dtype):
        return False

    if left.dtype.kind in ['O', 'S', 'U'] or right.dtype.kind in ['O', 'S', 'U']:
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.all(left == right)
    else:
        return ((left == right) | (isna(left) & isna(right))).all()
```
