The error message indicates that there is a ValueError in the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` in the function `array_equivalent`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the direct comparison between arrays (`left` and `right`) is causing the ValueError. This is likely because the comparison is not considering individual elements of the arrays but trying to compare entire arrays at once.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` to compare individual elements within the arrays rather than the entire arrays at once.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `array_equivalent`:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if left.dtype.kind in ['O', 'S', 'U'] or right.dtype.kind in ['O', 'S', 'U']:
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

This corrected function simplifies the comparisons and directly uses `np.array_equal` to compare arrays, which is the correct way to compare NumPy arrays for equivalence.
