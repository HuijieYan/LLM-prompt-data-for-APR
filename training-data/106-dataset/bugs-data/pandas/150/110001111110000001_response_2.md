The error message indicates that there is a ValueError in the code, specifically at this line:

```python
if left_value != right_value:
    ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
```

This suggests that the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` is resulting in an array with more than one element, leading to an ambiguous truth value.

The potential error in the code is the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` within the for loop. This comparison is problematic when dealing with arrays with more than one element.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison between NumPy arrays should be handled differently than comparisons between individual elements. When comparing arrays, it's common to use `np.array_equal()` or similar comparison functions.

To fix the bug, the comparison between `left_value` and `right_value` should be replaced with a proper array comparison function, such as `np.array_equal()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compatibility
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left.ravel(), right.ravel())
    
    # comparison for NaN and None
    return (np.isnan(left) == np.isnan(right)).all() and (left[~np.isnan(left)] == right[~np.isnan(right)]).all()
```
