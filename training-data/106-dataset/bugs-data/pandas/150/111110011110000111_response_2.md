The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` is trying to check if `left` and `right` arrays are equivalent using the `array_equivalent` function. The error message indicates that the bug is likely occurring within the `array_equivalent` function, specifically at the point when it is trying to compare `left_value` and `right_value`.

The error message "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" suggests that there is an issue with the comparison of arrays `left_value` and `right_value`.

The issue is caused by the direct equality comparison (using `==`) of arrays `left` and `right` within the `array_equivalent` function. This comparison does not handle the case of arrays with more than one element, leading to the ambiguous truth value error.

To fix the issue, the comparison of arrays `left` and `right` should be modified to accommodate arrays with more than one element. One approach to resolve this issue is to use the `.all()` method to check if all elements in the arrays are equal.

Here's the corrected `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # check if all elements are equal
    return np.all(left == right)
```
