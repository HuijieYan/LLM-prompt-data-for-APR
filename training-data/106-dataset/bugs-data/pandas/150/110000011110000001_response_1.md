The error message is indicating that the issue is occurring in the array comparison section within the `array_equivalent` function. The error message specifically mentions "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous."

The error is occurring because the comparison `if left_value != right_value` is being performed on arrays `left_value` and `right_value`, rather than on individual elements of the arrays.

To fix this bug, you should iterate through the elements of the arrays and perform the comparison on individual elements instead of directly comparing the arrays.

Here's the corrected `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.str_):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

        for left_value, right_value in zip(left.flat, right.flat):
            if left_value != right_value:
                return False
        return True

    # NaNs can occur in float and complex arrays.
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.complexfloating):
        return np.array_equal(left, right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))

    # if we have structured dtypes, compare first
    if left.dtype.type is np.void or right.dtype.type is np.void:
        if left.dtype != right.dtype:
            return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
