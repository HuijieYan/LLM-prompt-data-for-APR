The test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` creates two NumPy arrays `left` and `right`, both containing nested arrays. The `array_equivalent` function is called with the `strict_nan` parameter set to `True`. The function should return `True` as both `left` and `right` are equal, but it raises a `ValueError` instead.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the issue could be related to the comparison of NumPy arrays using the `!=` operator. This can lead to the comparison of entire arrays, which results in an ambiguous truth value error when attempting to evaluate the expression as a boolean.

To fix this issue, we should modify the comparison between the `left_value` and `right_value` arrays by using the `np.array_equal` function to compare the nested arrays.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    # Object arrays can contain None, NaN and NaT.
    # string dtypes must be come to this path for NumPy 1.7.1 compat
    if left.dtype.type is np.object_ or right.dtype.type is np.object_:

        if not strict_nan:
            # isna considers NaN and None to be equivalent.
            return np.array_equal(left, right)

        for left_value, right_value in zip(left, right):
            if not np.array_equal(left_value, right_value):
                return False
        return True

    # NaNs can occur in float and complex arrays.
    if np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.floating) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.floating):

        # empty
        if not (np.prod(left.shape) and np.prod(right.shape)):
            return True
        return ((left == right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))).all()

    # numpy will will not allow this type of datetimelike vs integer comparison
    elif np.issubdtype(left.dtype, np.datetime64) or np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.datetime64):
        return False

    return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly compare nested arrays and resolve the previously encountered `ValueError`.
