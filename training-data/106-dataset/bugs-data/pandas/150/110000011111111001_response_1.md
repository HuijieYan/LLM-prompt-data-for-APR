The error occurs when the `array_equivalent` function is called in the test case `test_array_equivalent_nested` with the parameters `left` and `right`. The error is a `ValueError` and is caused by the comparison of `left_value` and `right_value` when they are arrays with more than one element.

The bug in the `array_equivalent` function is the direct comparison of arrays `left` and `right` using `==` operator without considering the presence of arrays within the arrays.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `array_equivalent` function to handle nested arrays appropriately.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the fixed function
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.
    """

    def is_equal_nested(x, y, strict_nan):
        if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and x.shape == y.shape:
            if x.shape == ():
                return (x == y) or (np.isnan(x) and np.isnan(y)) if strict_nan else (x == y)
            else:
                return all(is_equal_nested(x_val, y_val, strict_nan) for x_val, y_val in zip(x, y))
        else:
            return (x == y) or (np.isnan(x) and np.isnan(y)) if strict_nan else (x == y)

    return is_equal_nested(left, right, strict_nan)
```

This corrected implementation of the `array_equivalent` function uses a recursive approach to check for equivalence in nested arrays. It checks if the input is an array and then iterates through the array elements to compare them using the `is_equal_nested` helper function. This fix addresses the issue of comparing arrays with more than one element, preventing the occurrence of the `ValueError` and ensuring that the function behaves as expected.
