The function appears to be designed to compare two NumPy arrays for equivalence, considering non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations.

The potential error arises from the comparison of left and right arrays using `is_string_dtype` and `is_float_dtype` functions, which are not provided in the code. Additionally, there are comparisons such as `np.isnan` which could lead to errors.

It seems that the buggy function is not handling the comparison of NaNs or non-NaN elements correctly in all cases.

To fix this, we should use numpy functions directly to handle the comparison of NaNs and non-NaN elements. Specifically, we should use `np.isnan` and the logical array comparison functions to compare the arrays.

We also need to handle the comparison differently for different data types. For example, for object arrays, we can use numpy's `equal` and `isnan` methods to compare, for float and complex arrays we can use `(left == right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))` expression to compare and for other types of arrays, we can use `array_equal` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if left.dtype == np.object:
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.array_equal(left, right) and np.all(left == right)
    elif left.dtype.kind in 'fc':
        return np.array_equal(left, right) | (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right))
    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
```
