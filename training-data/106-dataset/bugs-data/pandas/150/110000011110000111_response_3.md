The error message indicates a ValueError: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This implies that there is an issue with boolean operations involving arrays in the array_equivalent function.

The potential error location within the array_equivalent function is the boolean comparison `if left_value != right_value`, which is a comparison of two arrays.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison `left_value != right_value` is attempting to compare two arrays directly, which can result in ambiguous truth values.

To fix the bug, we can use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the equality of the two arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the array_equivalent function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if np.array_equal(left, right):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In this corrected code, we use the `np.array_equal` function to compare the equality of the two arrays. If the arrays are equal, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This approach handles the comparison of arrays properly and avoids the ambiguous truth value error.
