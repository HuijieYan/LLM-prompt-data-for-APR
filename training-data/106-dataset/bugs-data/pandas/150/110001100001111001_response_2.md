The potential error location within the problematic function is in the comparison logic. The function aims to compare two arrays and return 'True' if the arrays have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations; otherwise, it returns 'False'. The error occurs due to incorrect comparison logic when handling different cases and shapes of arrays.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug include:
1. Inconsistent handling of NaN values and None values when comparing object arrays with strings. The function does not cater to these cases properly.
2. Inadequate handling of different shapes of arrays, leading to incorrect comparison results.
3. Lack of proper handling for different data types when comparing arrays.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure that NaN and None values are treated consistently when comparing object arrays with strings.
2. Implement proper handling for arrays with different shapes to avoid incorrect comparison results.
3. Address the comparison logic for different data types to ensure accurate comparison results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    if strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return np.array_equal(np.where(np.isnan(left), np.nan, left), np.where(np.isnan(right), np.nan, right))
```
