The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of NaN values and comparison of arrays of different dtypes.

The function currently has issues with comparing arrays containing NaN values, particularly when the dtypes are different. It also has problems comparing arrays of different dtypes such as string dtypes and datetime dtypes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle NaN values properly and ensure that the comparison is done correctly for arrays with different dtypes.

Here's the corrected code for the array_equivalent function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(left.dtype) or pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(right.dtype):
        if not strict_nan:
            return np.array_equal(left, right)
        else:
            return np.array_equal(left, right) and not np.any(left != right)

    elif pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(left.dtype) or pd.api.types.is_complex_dtype(left.dtype):
        return np.all(np.isclose(left, right, equal_nan=not strict_nan))

    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(left.dtype) or pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(right.dtype):
        return np.array_equal(left, right)

    else:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
```

In the corrected function, we use the pandas library to check the dtypes of the arrays and handle comparisons accordingly. We also use np.all and np.any for array comparisons to ensure that they are done element-wise. Additionally, we use np.isclose to handle floating-point comparisons, including handling NaN values.
