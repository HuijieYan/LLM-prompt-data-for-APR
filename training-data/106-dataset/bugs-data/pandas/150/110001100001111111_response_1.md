The problematic function is trying to compare two arrays, `left` and `right`, to check if they have equal non-NaN elements and NaNs in corresponding locations. The function is also expected to consider the `strict_nan` parameter, which is a boolean flag. 

The error message will be generated if the shapes of the input arrays are not equal. However, in case 3, although the shapes are not equal, there is no explicit handling of this case in the code, leading to a potential bug.

The bug in the function is related to handling arrays with different shapes. The current implementation does not explicitly handle cases where the shapes of the input arrays are different.

To fix the bug, we can add a conditional check in the `array_equivalent` function to ensure that the shapes of the input arrays are equal before performing further comparisons. Additionally, for each element-wise comparison, there should be checks to ensure that the arrays are not exhausted before accessing elements at the same position.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    if left.shape != right.shape:  # Adding shape check
        return False

    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    for i in range(left.shape[0]): # looping through rows
        for j in range(left.shape[1]): # looping through columns
            left_value = left[i, j]
            right_value = right[i, j]

            if left_value is not None or right_value is not None:
                if left_value is None and right_value is None:
                    continue
                if left_value == right_value:
                    continue
                if strict_nan:
                    return False
                if not np.isnan(left_value) and not np.isnan(right_value):
                    return False

    return True
```

In this corrected implementation, we check for shape equality and then loop through each element of the arrays to perform the required comparisons. This ensures that we handle arrays with different shapes and compares the elements in the arrays in a proper way. The corrected function should address the bug and handle the input cases correctly.
