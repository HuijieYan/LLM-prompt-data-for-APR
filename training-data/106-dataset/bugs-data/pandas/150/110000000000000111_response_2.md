Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring in the section of the function that handles comparisons for string dtypes and NaNs. This is based on the assumption that the function is designed to compare two arrays for equality, and the error message indicates that the function is not handling NaNs correctly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The code may not be handling NaNs and string dtypes correctly. It also seems to be checking for special cases such as NaT and None, which could potentially lead to incorrect comparisons.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for NaNs and handle them explicitly.
2. Update the code to handle string dtypes properly and make comparisons accordingly.
3. Simplify the code to avoid checking for special cases such as NaT and None, as they may not be necessary for array equality comparisons.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    """
    True if two arrays, left and right, have equal non-NaN elements, and NaNs
    in corresponding locations.  False otherwise. It is assumed that left and
    right are NumPy arrays of the same dtype. The behavior of this function
    (particularly with respect to NaNs) is not defined if the dtypes are
    different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left, right : ndarrays
    strict_nan : bool, default False
        If True, consider NaN and None to be different.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equivalent.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    True
    >>> array_equivalent(
    ...     np.array([1, np.nan, 2]),
    ...     np.array([1, 2, np.nan]))
    False
    """

    # convert input arrays to numpy arrays
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)

    # check for shape compatibility
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False

    if np.array_equal(left, right):
        return True
    else:
        return False
