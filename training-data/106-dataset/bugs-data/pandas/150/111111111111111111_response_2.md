The error message indicates that there is an issue with a comparison operation inside the `array_equivalent` function. The comparison operation is leading to a ValueError due to the ambiguous truth value of an array with more than one element.

The potential error location is:
```python
if left_value != right_value:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison is being performed between two NumPy arrays without considering element-wise comparison for arrays. Instead of a direct comparison, the comparison should be performed element-wise between the corresponding elements of the arrays.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be implemented with the `np.array_equal` function to compare the arrays element-wise.

Here's the corrected code for the `array_equivalent` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def array_equivalent(left, right, strict_nan=False):
    left, right = np.asarray(left), np.asarray(right)
    
    # shape compat
    if left.shape != right.shape:
        return False
    
    if not strict_nan:
        return np.array_equal(left, right)
    else:
        return (np.array_equal(left, right) or (np.isnan(left) & np.isnan(right)).all())
```
