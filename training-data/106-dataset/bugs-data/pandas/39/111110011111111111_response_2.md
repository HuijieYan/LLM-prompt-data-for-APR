The error occurs because the `drop` operation changes the original DataFrame `df` when `inplace=True` is passed, which affects the subsequent inplace arithmetic operations. This causes unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function to handle the inplace arithmetic operations correctly, by ensuring that the modifications to the DataFrame are captured and reflected in the correct manner.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )
    # inplace operators (I feel like these should get passed an `inplace=True`
    # or just be removed

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)

            # ensure the changes to the dataframe are captured
            if isinstance(result, type(self)):
                self._update_inplace(result, verify_is_copy=False)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check to ensure that if the result of the operation is of the same type as the original dataframe (`self`), the changes are captured and reflected in the inplace operation.

This fix should address the issue of inplace arithmetic operations not working as expected in the presence of the `drop` method with `inplace=True`. This change should address the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior for the `DataFrame` operations.
