The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the shape of the DataFrame. This suggests that there is an issue with the implementation of the inplace operations (__iadd__, __isub__, __imul__, __ipow__) in the add_special_arithmetic_methods function.

Looking at the code, it seems that the issue is related to how the inplace operators are being implemented. The _wrap_inplace_method function is intended to return an inplace wrapper for the input method, but there may be an issue with how it updates the DataFrame inplace.

To fix the bug, the inplace operations should correctly update the DataFrame inplace and return the modified DataFrame. Additionally, the integration of inplace operations should ensure that the DataFrame shape is maintained properly after each operation.

Corrected code for the add_special_arithmetic_methods function:
```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )
    
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)

            # Update the DataFrame inplace with the result
            self._update_inplace(result, verify_is_copy=False)

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    inplace_ops = ["add", "sub", "mul", "truediv", "floordiv", "mod", "pow", "and", "or", "xor"]
    for op in inplace_ops:
        new_methods[f"__i{op}__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[f"__{op}__"])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In the corrected code, the _wrap_inplace_method function is updated to correctly update the DataFrame inplace and return the modified DataFrame. Additionally, the inplace operations are integrated with the new_methods dictionary, ensuring that the DataFrame shape is maintained properly after each operation.
