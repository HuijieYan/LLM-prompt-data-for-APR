The issue seems to be related to the in-place operations of the DataFrame and how it affects other variables. It appears that the "inplace=True" argument in the drop method is not working as expected and is leading to unintended behavior when modifying other variables.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the in-place method wrappers that are being added to the class. These wrappers are meant to support in-place arithmetic operations, but they might be causing unintended side effects when applied to DataFrame operations.

The bug is likely occurring because the in-place wrappers are not performing the expected behavior when used in combination with other operations on the DataFrame.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revisit the implementation of the in-place method wrappers and ensure that they are not causing unintended side effects when combined with other DataFrame operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    # Corrected implementation of the in-place method wrappers
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            # No longer using the _update_inplace method here

            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    new_methods.update(
        dict(
            __iadd__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__add__"]),
            __isub__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__sub__"]),
            __imul__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mul__"]),
            __itruediv__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__truediv__"]),
            __ifloordiv__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__floordiv__"]),
            __imod__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mod__"]),
            __ipow__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__pow__"]),
        )
    )

    new_methods.update(
        dict(
            __iand__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__and__"]),
            __ior__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__or__"]),
            __ixor__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__xor__"]),
        )
    )

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

By removing the specific DataFrame-related operations from the in-place wrappers and ensuring that they only perform the intended in-place updates without affecting other variables, the corrected code should address the issue with unintended side effects when using the in-place operations.
