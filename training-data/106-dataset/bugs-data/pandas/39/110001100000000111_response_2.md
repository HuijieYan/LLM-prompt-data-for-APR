The problem in the code is likely due to the inplace operation in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function. When using `inplace=True` on the `df.drop` method, Pandas returns None and does the operation in place. This means that `df` is changed in place and the result is None, which explains why `y` is added to `np.min(y)` in the second example.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the method to properly handle inplace operations and return the modified DataFrame.

Additionally, the `_wrap_inplace_method` has been defined twice in the function, which is unnecessary. It should be removed and only called once.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method_name):
        def f(self, other):
            method = getattr(self, method_name)
            result = method(other)
            self._data = result._data
            return self

        f.__name__ = f"__i{method_name.strip('__')}__"
        return f

    inplace_methods = ["add", "sub", "mul", "truediv", "floordiv", "mod", "pow", "and", "or", "xor"]
    for method_name in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[f"__i{method_name}__"] = _wrap_inplace_method(f'__{method_name}__')

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

The corrected code now properly handles inplace operations and avoids modifying the input DataFrame in place. This should fix the issue.
