The error in the problematic function is related to the inplace operations. In the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function is used to implement the inplace operators such as `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`, etc. However, there is a mistake in the `_wrap_inplace_method` function. It does not correctly handle the inplace operations, which leads to the error in the test cases.

The reason for the bug is that the `_wrap_inplace_method` function doesn't correctly implement the inplace operations. The code doesn't properly handle the inplace update of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function should be modified to correctly handle the inplace operations as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            # Perform the operation inplace
            method(self, other, inplace=True)
            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    inplace_methods = ["__add__", "__sub__", "__mul__", "__truediv__", "__floordiv__", "__mod__", "__pow__", "__and__", "__or__", "__xor__"]
    
    new_methods.update({
        name: _wrap_inplace_method(method) for name, method in new_methods.items() if name in inplace_methods
    })

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

The corrected code modifies the `_wrap_inplace_method` function to handle inplace operations correctly. The `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`, etc. are now updated to perform their operations in place. This should resolve the issue with the test cases and ensure that the inplace operations are correctly applied.
