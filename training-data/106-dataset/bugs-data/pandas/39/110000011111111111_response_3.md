The error in the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function occurs at the `_wrap_inplace_method` which is used to wrap the arithmetic methods to perform inplace operations.

The issue seems to be related to the way the inplace methods are being wrapped, causing the incorrect behavior for the actual inplace operations.

To fix the bug, you should modify the `_wrap_inplace_method` function to correctly update the inplace operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(operation_name):
        """
        Return an inplace wrapper for the operation.
        """

        def inplace_wrapper(self, other):
            result = getattr(self, operation_name)(other)
            self._update_inplace(result, verify_is_copy=False)
            return self

        return inplace_wrapper

    inplace_operations = ["add", "sub", "mul", "truediv", "floordiv", "mod", "pow", "and", "or", "xor"]
    for operation_name in inplace_operations:
        in_place_method = f'__i{operation_name}__'
        new_methods[in_place_method] = _wrap_inplace_method(operation_name)

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

With this corrected code, the inplace methods will be wrapped correctly, and the issue with inplace operations should be resolved. The tests should pass without any errors or assertions.
