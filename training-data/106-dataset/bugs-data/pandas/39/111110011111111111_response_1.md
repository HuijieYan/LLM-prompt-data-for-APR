The bug is likely to be in the function `add_special_arithmetic_methods`. The error message indicates that the DataFrame shapes are different after performing an operation in place. This suggests that there is an issue with the in-place operation and the shapes of the DataFrames are not being handled properly.

The function seems to have issues with the in-place operations for DataFrame and Series objects, resulting in unexpected behavior when performing arithmetic operations with the `__iadd__`, `__isub__`, `__imul__`, and `__ipow__` methods.

To fix this issue, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function needs to be modified to correctly update the DataFrame or Series in-place. Also, the method `_add_methods` should be reviewed to ensure that all special arithmetic methods are correctly added to the class.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    
    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            self._update_inplace(result)
            return self

        return f

    new_methods = {
        "__iadd__": _wrap_inplace_method(cls.__add__),
        "__isub__": _wrap_inplace_method(cls.__sub__),
        "__imul__": _wrap_inplace_method(cls.__mul__),
        "__ipow__": _wrap_inplace_method(cls.__pow__),
    }
    
    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

This corrected function ensures that the in-place methods perform the operations correctly and update the DataFrame or Series in-place.
