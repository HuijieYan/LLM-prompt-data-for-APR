The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in the behavior of the `inplace` parameter for the `drop` method of a DataFrame. The intention seems to be to remove the 'target' column from the DataFrame. However, depending on whether the operation is done in place or not, the behavior is inconsistent.

The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function. As per the code and test case, the inplace operations on the DataFrame are not preserving the expected behavior, causing the `tm.assert_frame_equal` to fail in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inplace operations (in this case, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `pow`) on the DataFrame preserve the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    # ... existing code ...

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            df = self.reindex_like(self, copy=False)._data  # reindex to ensure alignment
            df.update(result)  # Update the DataFrame with the computation result
            return self

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    new_methods.update(
        dict(
            __iadd__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__add__"]),
            __isub__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__sub__"]),
            __imul__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__mul__"]),
            __ipow__=_wrap_inplace_method(new_methods["__pow__"]),
        )
    )

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

With this corrected code, the inplace operations will now update the DataFrame in the expected manner, preserving the behavior of the DataFrame as intended. This should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
