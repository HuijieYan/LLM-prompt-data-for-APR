The bug in the function add_special_arithmetic_methods arises from the `_wrap_inplace_method` function, which is intended to create an inplace wrapper for various special arithmetic methods. However, the current implementation is likely causing an error due to unhandled edge cases and non-standard use of methods.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to replace the _wrap_inplace_method method with a more standard implementation that properly handles inplace operations.

Here's the corrected code for the add_special_arithmetic_methods function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """

        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)
            return result

        name = method.__name__.strip("__")
        f.__name__ = f"__i{name}__"
        return f

    inplace_methods = [
        '__add__', '__sub__', '__mul__', '__truediv__', '__floordiv__', 
        '__mod__', '__pow__', '__and__', '__or__', '__xor__'
    ]

    for method_name in inplace_methods:
        new_methods[method_name] = _wrap_inplace_method(new_methods[method_name])

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In this corrected code, the implementation of _wrap_inplace_method has been simplified to properly handle inplace operations for various special arithmetic methods. The code now includes a loop to apply the _wrap_inplace_method to all the necessary methods, eliminating the need to manually add each method. This makes the code more maintainable and less error-prone.
