Potential error location: The issue may be with the `_wrap_inplace_method` function, as it is not being used correctly to create the inplace methods.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_wrap_inplace_method` function is defined inside the `add_special_arithmetic_methods` function, but it is not being called correctly to wrap the inplace methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `_wrap_inplace_method` function for each inplace method and assign the result to the corresponding inplace method in the `new_methods` dictionary.
2. Ensure that the `_wrap_inplace_method` function returns the correct inplace method with the required functionality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_special_arithmetic_methods(cls):
    """
    Adds the full suite of special arithmetic methods (``__add__``,
    ``__sub__``, etc.) to the class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        special methods will be defined and pinned to this class
    """
    _, _, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method = _get_method_wrappers(cls)
    new_methods = _create_methods(
        cls, arith_method, comp_method, bool_method, special=True
    )

    def _wrap_inplace_method(method):
        """
        return an inplace wrapper for this method
        """
        def f(self, other):
            result = method(self, other)

            # this makes sure that we are aligned like the input
            # we are updating inplace so we want to ignore is_copy
            self._update_inplace(
                result.reindex_like(self, copy=False)._data, verify_is_copy=False
            )

            return self

        name = method.__name__[2:]  # remove leading underscores
        inplace_name = f"__i{name}__"
        f.__name__ = inplace_name
        return f

    inplace_methods = [
        "__iadd__", "__isub__", "__imul__", "__itruediv__", "__ifloordiv__",
        "__imod__", "__ipow__", "__iand__", "__ior__", "__ixor__"
    ]
    
    for method_name in inplace_methods:
        inplace_method_name = method_name
        method = new_methods[method_name[1:]]  # remove leading underscore
        new_methods[inplace_method_name] = _wrap_inplace_method(method)

    _add_methods(cls, new_methods=new_methods)
```

In this corrected code, the `_wrap_inplace_method` function is called for each inplace method, and the resulting inplace method is added to the `new_methods` dictionary. This ensures that the correct inplace methods are created and added to the class.
