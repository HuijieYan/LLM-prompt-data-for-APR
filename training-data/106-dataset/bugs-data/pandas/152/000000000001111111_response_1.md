The error is occurring because the function is not handling tuples correctly. When a tuple of Series is passed to the function, it is trying to concatenate the tuple with a list, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle tuples as well as lists properly. This can be done by converting the tuple to a list before concatenating it with other lists.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
