The error occurs in the `append` method of the `Series` class. The error message indicates that the method is trying to concatenate a list and a tuple, which is not allowed.

The reason behind the bug is that the method is not handling tuple inputs correctly. The method is supposed to accept either a Series or a list/tuple of Series, but it fails to handle the tuple input properly.

To fix the bug, the method should check if `to_append` is a tuple and handle the concatenation accordingly. It should convert the tuple into a list before concatenating it with the existing list of Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

With this correction, the `append` method will correctly handle both list and tuple inputs, and the bug that caused the TypeError will be fixed.
