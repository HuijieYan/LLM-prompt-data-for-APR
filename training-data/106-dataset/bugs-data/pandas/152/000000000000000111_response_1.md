The error occurs in the `append` function in the provided code, where the function is trying to concatenate a list with a tuple. The error message indicates that it's unable to concatenate a list with a tuple.

The reason behind this bug is that when `to_append` is a tuple, the code attempts to concatenate it with a list using the `+` operator, which is not supported by Python.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when `to_append` is a tuple differently.

The corrected code for the `append` function is as follows:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert the tuple to a list if it's a tuple
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
