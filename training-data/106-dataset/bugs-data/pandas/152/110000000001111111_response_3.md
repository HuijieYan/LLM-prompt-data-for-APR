The bug occurs because the function attempts to concatenate a list and a tuple, but the operation is not supported in Python.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle both lists and tuples as input. We can convert the tuple to a list before concatenating it with the existing list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```

With this modification, the function will be able to handle both lists and tuples of Series as input, preventing the TypeError that was occurring before.
