The test case involves creating a `Series` and then attempting to append a tuple of `Series` to the original `Series`. The expected result is to successfully append the tuple of `Series`, similar to what happens when a list of `Series` is appended.

The potential error location within the `append` function is in the `if` statement that checks if `to_append` is an instance of a list or tuple. When `to_append` is a tuple, the code attempts to concatenate it directly with the `self` object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code logic is incomplete and does not handle tuple inputs correctly.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to convert the tuple of `Series` into a list of `Series` before concatenating it with the `self` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if not isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):  # Check if to_append is not a list or tuple
        to_append = [to_append]  # Convert to_append into a list with a single element

    to_concat = [self] + to_append
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that `to_append` is converted into a list if it is a single `Series` object or a tuple of `Series` objects. This way, the concatenation logic will work correctly regardless of whether the input `to_append` is a single `Series`, a list of `Series`, or a tuple of `Series`.
