The bug in the function is mainly caused by the incorrect handling of the 'to_append' parameter when it is a single Series. The 'to_concat' variable is creating a list with both the 'self' Series and the 'to_append' Series, without checking whether the 'to_append' is a single Series or a list/tuple of Series.

To fix the bug in the function, the 'to_append' parameter needs to be checked for its type before concatenation so that it can be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

In this corrected code, the 'to_append' parameter is first checked using the isinstance() function to determine whether it's a single Series or a list/tuple of Series. If it's a single Series, it is converted into a list containing only that Series before concatenation with the 'self' Series. This way, the function can handle both single Series and multiple Series as required.
