The error message is indicating that the function is unable to concatenate a tuple with a list, which is expected behavior according to the current implementation of the `append` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
`to_concat = [self] + to_append`

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `to_append` is expected to be a list or a tuple of Series, but the current implementation of the `append` method only accepts a list, not a tuple.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle both lists and tuples. The correct code for the `append` function should be:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```

After making these changes, the `append` function should be able to handle both lists and tuples of Series for concatenation.
