Potential error location: The error is likely occurring when trying to concatenate a tuple of Series with a list of Series in the `append` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `append` method tries to concatenate a tuple of Series with a list of Series using the `+` operator, which is not supported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we can convert the tuple of Series to a list of Series before concatenating them.

Corrected code:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        if isinstance(to_append, tuple):  # Convert tuple to list
            to_append = list(to_append)
        to_concat = [self] + to_append
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
With this correction, the `append` method should be able to handle concatenation of both lists and tuples of Series correctly.
