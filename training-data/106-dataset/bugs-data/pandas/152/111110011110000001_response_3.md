The error is occurring because the `append` method is attempting to concatenate a list and a tuple. This error is happening because the `to_concat` variable is not being handled properly. It is expecting either a list or a tuple, but not both.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `append` method to handle both lists and tuples by first checking the type of `to_append` and then converting it to a list if it's a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    """
    Concatenate two or more Series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    to_append : Series or list/tuple of Series
        Series to append with self.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise Exception on creating index with duplicates.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Concatenated Series.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Convert tuple to list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity)
```
By converting the `to_append` tuple to a list when it's detected as a tuple, we ensure that the `append` method can handle both lists and tuples correctly.
