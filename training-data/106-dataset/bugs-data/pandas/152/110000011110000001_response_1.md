The error message indicates that the issue stems from attempting to concatenate a list with a tuple, resulting in a TypeError. This is likely occurring within the `append` function, where the `to_append` parameter is not being handled correctly. 

The bug occurs in the `append` function due to an incorrect implementation of handling the `to_append` input. The function attempts to concatenate a list (`self`) with the `to_append` parameter, which may be a list or a tuple. However, it only accounts for the case where `to_append` is a list and does not handle the case where it is a tuple, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `append` function needs to be modified to handle both list and tuple inputs appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, to_append, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(to_append, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + list(to_append)  # Ensure to_append is treated as a list
    else:
        to_concat = [self, to_append]
    return concat(
        to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity
    )
```
