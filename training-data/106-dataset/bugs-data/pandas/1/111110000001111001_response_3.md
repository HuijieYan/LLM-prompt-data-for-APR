The issue with the function is that it is not defined before the is_string_dtype function. Also, the imported libraries or functions such as np and pd are not defined in the given code which will cause errors. 

To fix this function we need to define the missing functions and libraries and also fix the return type of the _is_dtype function. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def is_string_dtype(arr_or_dtype):
    def _is_dtype(arr_or_dtype, condition):
        return condition(arr_or_dtype)

    def condition(dtype):
        return np.issubdtype(dtype, np.str_) or np.issubdtype(dtype, np.unicode_)

    return _is_dtype(arr_or_dtype, condition)
```
