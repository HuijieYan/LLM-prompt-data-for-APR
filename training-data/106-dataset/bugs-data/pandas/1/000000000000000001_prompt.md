# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def is_string_dtype(arr_or_dtype) -> bool:
    
    # TODO: gh-15585: consider making the checks stricter.
    def condition(dtype) -> bool:
        return dtype.kind in ("O", "S", "U") and not is_excluded_dtype(dtype)

    def is_excluded_dtype(dtype) -> bool:
        
        is_excluded_checks = (is_period_dtype, is_interval_dtype)
        return any(is_excluded(dtype) for is_excluded in is_excluded_checks)
