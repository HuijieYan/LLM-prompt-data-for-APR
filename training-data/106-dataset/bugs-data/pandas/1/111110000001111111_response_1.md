The issue seems to be with the `is_string_dtype` function incorrectly identifying categorical data as string dtype. 

The error is likely occurring in the `condition` function. The condition function checks if the dtype kind is "O", "S", or "U" which are associated with string dtypes. However, it does not account for the categorical data type, which is also of kind "O" but should not be considered a string dtype.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `condition` function to include a check for the categorical data type and return False if the dtype is of kind "O" but is a categorical data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_string_dtype` function:

```python
def is_string_dtype(arr_or_dtype) -> bool:
    def condition(dtype) -> bool:
        return dtype.kind in ("O", "S", "U") and not is_excluded_dtype(dtype)

    def is_excluded_dtype(dtype) -> bool:
        is_excluded_checks = (is_period_dtype, is_interval_dtype)
        return any(is_excluded(dtype) for is_excluded in is_excluded_checks)

    return _is_dtype(arr_or_dtype, condition) and not pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr_or_dtype)
```

This correction adds an additional check to the return statement to ensure that the dtype is not a categorical data type.

After making this change, the function should correctly identify categorical data as not being of the string dtype.
