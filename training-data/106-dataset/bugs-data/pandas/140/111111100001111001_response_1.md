The bug seems to be in the loop that is trying to convert the object types in the DataFrame. The error might be occurring because the loop is not iterating through all the object columns properly.

The function is trying to convert object columns to a different type, but it is only looking at the first object column (index 0) in the loop. This could cause issues if there are multiple object columns in the DataFrame.

To fix this, we can use the `select_dtypes` method to select only the columns with object dtype, and then iterate through those columns to convert their data types.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    # Select only the object columns
    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

    # Loop through the object columns and convert their data types
    for col in obj_cols:
        result[col] = result[col].astype('str')

    return result
```

In this corrected code, we use the `select_dtypes` method to get a list of object columns and then loop through those columns to convert their data types to string using the `astype` method. This approach should handle multiple object columns properly and fix the bug.
