The potential error location within the problematic function is the for loop that attempts to convert object columns to numeric.

The bug occurs because the `result.iloc` method performs integer-based selection of the columns. However, `obj_cols` is determined using the original column indices before any columns have been removed. This means that if any columns were dropped in the `result` DataFrame prior to this point, the `obj_cols` list may contain indices that no longer exist in the DataFrame. This would result in an "IndexError" when trying to access these non-existent columns.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the column names instead of integer indices for selection and conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[col])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result[col].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[col] = converted
    return result
```
