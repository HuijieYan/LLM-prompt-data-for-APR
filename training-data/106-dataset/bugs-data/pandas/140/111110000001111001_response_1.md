The potential error in the provided function is in the for loop where it is trying to convert object columns using the `maybe_convert_objects` function. The error occurs because `result.iloc[:, n]` is not being assigned the converted values properly.

The reason for the bug is that the conversion is not being applied to the DataFrame in a way that modifies the original DataFrame 'result'. Instead, the conversion is being made to a copy of the 'result' DataFrame and not being assigned back to the original DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to assign the converted values back to the original DataFrame. Additionally, we need to fix the logic for identifying object columns using dtypes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result[col])]
  
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = pd.to_numeric(result[col], errors='coerce', downcast='integer')
        result[col] = converted

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- We import the `pandas` and `is_object_dtype` from `pandas.api.types`.
- We use `pd.to_numeric` to convert object columns to numeric and use `errors='coerce'` to handle any non-convertible values.
- We then assign the converted values back to the original DataFrame 'result'.
- This will fix the bug and properly convert the object columns in the DataFrame.
