The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through `obj_cols` and converts the values using `maybe_convert_objects`. The bug occurs because `obj_cols` is empty, which means the loop doesn't actually perform any conversions on the result DataFrame.

The reason behind this bug is that `obj_cols` is calculated by looking for object data types in the DataFrame, but the example input DataFrame doesn't have any object data types, so `obj_cols` is empty.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check for the presence of object data types before looping through `obj_cols`. If there are no object data types, then the loop can be skipped.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    if obj_cols:
        for n in obj_cols:
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
            
    return result
```

In this corrected version of the function, we first check if `obj_cols` is not empty before entering the loop. If `obj_cols` contains any indices, we then proceed with the conversions. Otherwise, we skip the loop and return the original DataFrame. This should fix the bug and prevent unnecessary conversions when there are no object data types present in the input DataFrame.
