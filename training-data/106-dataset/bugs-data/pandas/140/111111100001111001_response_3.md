The bug is likely occurring because the function is trying to access the columns of the DataFrame using `int` values. However, it should be using the actual column names to access and manipulate the data.

The reason behind this bug could be that the function is assuming that the columns are of integer type, but instead they may be strings.

To fix the bug, we need to access the columns using their names instead of integer indices.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.indexes.numeric import Int64Index
from pandas.core.series import Series
from numpy import ndarray
from pandas.core.indexing._iLocIndexer import _iLocIndexer
from pandas.core.construction import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result[col])]

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result[col].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[col] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the function to access the columns using their names instead of integer indices, and then used those names to manipulate the data. Additionally, we added the required imports for the function to work correctly.
