The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to convert object dtype columns to numeric using `maybe_convert_objects` method. However, it is not appropriately handling the `obj_cols` and `n` index when accessing the columns and converting them.

The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly handling the index when accessing and converting the columns.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the index `n` correctly when converting the columns.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[result.columns[n]] = converted  # Correctly assigning the converted values back to the dataframe

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. We have made use of the correct index `n` when assigning the converted values back to the dataframe.
2. Instead of accessing columns using `iloc`, we are accessing them using `result.columns[n]` to apply the converted values correctly.

These corrections will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
