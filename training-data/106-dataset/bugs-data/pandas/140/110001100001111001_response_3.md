The bug in the given function seems to be related to the improper handling of the `obj_cols` variable and the subsequent conversion of object types.

The `obj_cols` variable is being determined based on the condition of whether the column in the result DataFrame has an object data type. However, the logic for determining these columns is incorrect, potentially leading to the incorrect selection of columns for conversion.

To fix this bug, you can modify the logic for determining obj_cols to correctly identify columns that have object data types. Additionally, the way in which the conversion of object types is handled can be improved.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.construction import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include='object').columns

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(result[col].values, convert_numeric=False)
        result[col] = converted

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `result.select_dtypes(include='object').columns` to correctly identify columns with object data types.
2. We loop through each object column and use the `maybe_convert_objects` function to convert the object types if needed, and then we assign the converted values back to the DataFrame.

These changes should address the issues in the original code and provide the expected behavior for the given function.
