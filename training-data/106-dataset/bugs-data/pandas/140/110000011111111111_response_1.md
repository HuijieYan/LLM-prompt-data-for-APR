The error seems to be originating from the `_recast_datatimelike_result` function, where the DataFrame is modified. The error is likely caused by the incorrect indexing of the columns in the DataFrame.

In the given test case, the `df.groupby("a").apply` function is generating a KeyError: 0. This error is likely related to column indexing and handling of datetimelike objects within the DataFrame.

The bug is occurring due to the incorrect handling of object columns and object dtype within the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function to properly handle the object columns and datetimelike objects. Specifically, we need to ensure that the indexing of the columns and modification of datetimelike objects are done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for n in result.select_dtypes(include='datetime').columns:
        result[n] = result[n].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

    return result
```

In the revised function, we are using `select_dtypes` to specifically select columns with datetimelike objects. We then apply the `dt.strftime` method to format the datetime objects as strings for proper handling.

This updated function should resolve the issue and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
