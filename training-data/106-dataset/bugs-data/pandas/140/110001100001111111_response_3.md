The bug is likely located within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The error message suggests that the apply function returns a timeseries, and the presence of a datetime column in the dataframe triggers the error. This indicates that the bug may be related to the handling of datetime columns within the apply function.

The potential error in the function could be the way it handles datetime columns when applying operations to the dataframe. It seems that when date/time columns are involved, the function encounters problems, possibly due to incorrect data type handling or conversion within the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle datetime columns appropriately. This may involve checking for datetime columns and applying suitable conversion or handling when date/time columns are encountered.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In this corrected function, it first checks if the column dtype is object before attempting conversion, which prevents unnecessary conversion errors. It also applies the `maybe_convert_objects` function only to object dtype columns to ensure that the conversion is appropriate.
