The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop where `result.iloc[:, n] = converted`.

The bug occurs because the loop is trying to convert the date/time values in the DataFrame to numeric values, which is causing the KeyError: 0 error. This is happening because the loop is accessing the first column (0-indexed) without considering the possibility that it might not be a valid index after the conversion.

To fix the bug, we can modify the loop to only convert the date/time values to numeric if they are in fact date/time values, and handle the conversion gracefully.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the dtype of the column before trying to convert it to numeric. If it's a date/time dtype, then we can safely convert it, otherwise, we can skip the conversion.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for n in range(len(result.columns)):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
