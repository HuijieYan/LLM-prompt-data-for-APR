The error occurs when the `result` DataFrame is processed inside the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. This function identifies object columns and tries to convert them, but it seems to be encountering an issue with the process.

The error message indicates a `KeyError: 0` when trying to get an item from the DataFrame. This suggests that the conversion process might be affecting the DataFrame's index and causing a mismatch.

It appears that the error is related to handling datetime columns during the apply process. It might be related to the way the object columns are being processed, leading to a mismatch in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the conversion process for object columns is handled correctly and does not interfere with the DataFrame's integrity.

The corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is provided below:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [idx for idx, dtype in enumerate(result.dtypes) if is_object_dtype(dtype)]

    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we use `enumerate` to properly capture the index and dtype of the DataFrame. This ensures that the object columns are correctly identified and processed for conversion without causing any index mismatch.
