The error message indicates a KeyError being raised during the test. The test creates a DataFrame with columns 'a' and 'b', and then groups by column 'a' and applies a lambda function to create a new Series with index [42]. The error occurs during this process.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. It iterates through the DataFrame columns and tries to convert objects to numeric types, but it does not account for the index used in the `apply` function during the test case.

The bug occurs because the `apply` function creates a new Series with a specific index based on the lambda function provided. The `_recast_datetimelike_result` function assumes that the column indexes are standard integer values within the range of the number of columns, which is not the case in the test scenario. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access the specific index provided in the lambda function.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function to handle the non-standard index values created during the `apply` process by ensuring that it aligns and reindexes the DataFrame appropriately.

Below is the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )
        result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    # Reindex the result to align with the expected index
    result = result.reindex(columns=sorted(result.columns))

    return result
```
