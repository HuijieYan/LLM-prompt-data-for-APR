The error occurs when the `test_apply_datetime_issue` test case is executed, and it fails due to a KeyError in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The error is raised when trying to get the value for key 0.

The potential error location within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is when trying to access columns using their indexes, as identified in the line `result.iloc[:, n] = converted`.

The error occurred because the object columns identified based on dtype=None, and so the indexes the index of these object type columns couldn't be determined, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the behavior when object type columns are present.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    # Identify object columns
    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

    for col in obj_cols:
        result[col] = pd.to_numeric(result[col], errors='ignore')

    return result
```
