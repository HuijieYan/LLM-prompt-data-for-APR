The error occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The bug seems to be related to the data type handling when the function tries to reassign values to the `result` DataFrame using `result.iloc[:, n] = converted`. This leads to a KeyError when the function attempts to access and modify specific indices.

The bug occurs because the function tries to directly assign values to the DataFrame using integer indices. This can cause issues if the DataFrame columns have non-standard integer labels or if the indices are not aligned properly.

To fix this bug, you can convert the columns to be of standard integer labels so that the assignment operation in the loop works correctly.

Additionally, it's also good practice to modify the columns directly using `result.columns` to ensure that the assignments are performed in the correct columns.

The corrected function would be:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )
        
        result[result.columns[n]] = converted  # directly modifying column

    return result
```

By using `result[result.columns[n]] = converted`, the bug should be resolved, and the function should be able to handle the DataFrame correctly without causing any KeyError.
