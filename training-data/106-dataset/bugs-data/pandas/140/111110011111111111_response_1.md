The problem is occurring in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, and the error is related to the `KeyError: 0` message. The error seems to be triggered when calling the `result.iloc` method within a loop.

The reason for the bug is that the index used in `result.iloc` does not exist, which leads to the `KeyError: 0` message. This could be caused by an incorrect setup of the loop index or a change in the behavior of the code between different versions of pandas.

To fix this bug, we can use the `.iloc` method to access the object columns of the DataFrame and perform the data conversion without the need for a loop. This approach will avoid the potential KeyError that is currently occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time-like data in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking, which can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    
    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
    result[obj_cols] = result[obj_cols].apply(pd.to_datetime, errors='ignore')

    return result
```

By using the `select_dtypes` method to identify the object columns and then applying `pd.to_datetime` to these columns, we can avoid potential KeyErrors and correctly convert the datetimelike data.
