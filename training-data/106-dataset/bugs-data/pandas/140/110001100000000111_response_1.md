The issue seems to be related to a change in behavior between pandas 0.24.2 and 0.25.1 when using the `apply` function on a dataframe that has a datetime column. The error message `KeyError: 0` indicates that there might be an issue with the indexing within the `apply` function.

After analyzing the provided code, it seems that the bug is located in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The function is attempting to convert datetime-like columns in the result dataframe using the `maybe_convert_objects` function, but appears to have an issue with how it handles the columns.

The probable reason for the bug is a change in pandas' behavior when converting datetime-like columns. This could be due to an update in the `maybe_convert_objects` function or changes in the way datetime-like columns are handled in pandas 0.25.1 compared to 0.24.2.

To fix the bug, we can revise the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function to handle datetime-like columns more robustly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """

    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=['datetime']).columns

    for col in obj_cols:
        result[col] = result[col].astype('datetime64[ns]')

    return result
```

This revised function uses `select_dtypes` to select only the datetime-like columns and then converts their dtype to `datetime64[ns]`. This approach is more straightforward and should handle the datetime-like columns in a more predictable way, avoiding the KeyError issue.
