The error in the function `_recast_datetimelike_result` is likely occurring in the loop that iterates through the `obj_cols` and attempts to convert the values using `maybe_convert_objects`. The `result.iloc[:, n]` operation is trying to convert values based on the index `n`, but it seems that the index `n` is not being correctly assigned.

The error occurs because the function is incorrectly assuming that `result.columns` will always correspond to the index being used in the loop. However, when the "date" column is present, the index for the "object" dtype is not matching the index of the `obj_cols`, causing the conversion to fail.

To fix this error, a more reliable way of iterating through the DataFrame columns and handling the object dtype needs to be implemented. One approach could be to directly iterate through the DataFrame columns using a `for` loop, and check for object dtype for each column.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    
    result = result.copy()

    for col in result.columns:
        if is_object_dtype(result[col]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(result[col].values, convert_numeric=False)
            result[col] = converted

    return result
```

This corrected code iterates through each column of the DataFrame and checks for the object dtype, applying the conversion if necessary. This approach ensures that the correct columns are being converted and avoids the issue with incorrect indices.
