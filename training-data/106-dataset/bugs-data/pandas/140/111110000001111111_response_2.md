The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that is intended to convert object dtype columns to the appropriate type. The loop is not correctly handling this conversion and is resulting in the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that in pandas 0.25.1, the apply function returns a timeseries, and when there is a datetime column in the dataframe, it throws a KeyError: 0 error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the loop that converts object dtype columns to handle the conversion correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.construction import maybe_convert_objects
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_datetime=True
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. We have imported the necessary functions and classes from the pandas library.
2. The loop for converting object dtype columns has been modified to use `maybe_convert_objects` with `convert_datetime=True` to correctly handle the conversion of datetime columns.
3. The function now returns the modified DataFrame as expected.
