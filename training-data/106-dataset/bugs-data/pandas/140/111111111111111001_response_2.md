The test case `test_apply_datetime_issue` creates a DataFrame with a single column 'a' containing the value 'foo' and another column 'b' containing a datetime value. It then applies a lambda function to group the DataFrame by column 'a' and create a Series with the value 'spam' and index 42. The error message indicates a KeyError with a value of 0, which is likely related to the way the columns are indexed in the resulting DataFrame.

The potential error location within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is the process of handling the datetime-like columns in the input DataFrame `result`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function attempts to reassign values to specific columns using index locations (`iloc`). The process of handling datetime-like columns might be affecting the column indexing, leading to the KeyError in the test case.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the structure of the resulting DataFrame is preserved when processing the datetime-like columns. The steps to recast the datetime-like columns should not disrupt the indexing of the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    for col in result.columns:
        if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result[col]):
            result[col] = result[col].astype('object')

    return result
```

In the corrected function, the datetime-like columns are processed by iterating over the columns and checking if they are of datetime or timedelta type using `is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype`. If they are, the columns are converted to the 'object' data type to preserve their original structure and avoid potential indexing issues.
