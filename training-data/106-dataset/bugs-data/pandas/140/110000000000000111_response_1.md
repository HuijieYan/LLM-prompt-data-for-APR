The issue in the provided code is related to the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, which is supposed to handle datetime-like results. The issue description indicates that the error occurs when using the `apply` function on a DataFrame with a datetime column, and it is related to the changes in behavior between pandas 0.24.2 and 0.25.1.

The potential error location within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is the loop that attempts to convert object columns to numeric using `maybe_convert_objects`. This may conflict with datetime-like columns and cause unexpected behavior, leading to the error described in the issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle datetime-like columns correctly when trying to convert object columns to numeric.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to specifically exclude datetime-like columns from the conversion process, as these columns should be treated differently than regular object columns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx]) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `obj_cols` list comprehension filters out the datetime-like columns when identifying the object columns that need conversion. This allows the function to correctly handle datetime-like columns and avoid the error described in the issue.
