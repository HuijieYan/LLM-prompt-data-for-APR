The error occurs when the `result` DataFrame is passed to the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, which attempts to modify columns labeled with non-standard int values (e.g., 42) and causes a KeyError due to the mismatch in column labels.

The bug in the function `_recast_datetimelike_result` is that it assumes the standard integer column labels, which leads to the KeyError. 

To fix this bug, the function should iterate over the columns and modify only the data type of the columns containing datetime-like values. Additionally, for the given test case, it's important to address the handling of non-standard column labels, such as 42 in this case.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time-like data in the original, this function coerces dates
    to ensure that object dtype columns are appropriately handled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    for column in result.columns:
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(result[column]):
             result[column] = result[column].astype('object')
    
    return result
```

By iterating over each column in the DataFrame and checking if it contains datetime-like values, we ensure that only columns with datetime-like values are converted to objects, thereby addressing the KeyError issue.
