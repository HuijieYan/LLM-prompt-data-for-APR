The error message indicates that a KeyError is raised, which means that the index [0] does not exist in the result DataFrame when applying the lambda function. This error likely occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly in the block where `obj_cols` is determined and used to convert objects.

The bug occurs because the original code fails to properly identify the object columns in the result DataFrame when applying the lambda function. This leads to issues with indexing and converting object types, ultimately causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify and convert object columns in the result DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result[col])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result[col].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[col] = converted
    return result
```

By using the correct column indices (`col`) and handling object type conversion for each column, the bug should be fixed in the updated function.
