The error occurs in the `obj_cols` list comprehension within the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The error message indicates a `KeyError`, which suggests that there is an issue with how the columns are being accessed in this list comprehension.

The bug is likely due to the fact that the original code tries to use the index as a column label, but it should access the column labels directly instead.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way columns are accessed inside the list comprehension.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, is_object_dtype, maybe_convert_objects
import pandas as pd

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        result.columns[idx] for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result[col].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[col] = converted
    return result
```

In this corrected code:
- We use `result.columns[idx]` to access the column labels in the `obj_cols` list comprehension.
- Inside the loop, we use `col` to access the column label directly when converting the objects and updating the result.

This corrected code should resolve the KeyError issue and properly handle the datetimelike columns within the DataFrame.
