The error seems to occur when the `test_apply_datetime_issue` test case is being executed and the `df.groupby("a").apply(lambda x: pd.Series(["spam"], index=[42]))` line is throwing a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The function is supposed to recast the datetime-like result, but it seems to be causing the error with the `result.iloc[:, n] = converted` line.

The error occurs because the function attempts to access the converted values using the index of the DataFrame directly, which may lead to a KeyError if the index doesn't match the converted values.

To fix the bug, the function should create a new DataFrame with the converted values and then return it. This can be done by creating a new DataFrame using the converted values and the existing index and columns of the original DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )
        result[result.columns[n]] = converted

    return result
```

With this correction, the `result` DataFrame is modified to include the converted values for the datetime-like columns, and it returns the modified DataFrame. This should fix the bug and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
