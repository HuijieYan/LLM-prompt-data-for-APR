Potential error location: The error may occur at the line where the `maybe_convert_objects` function is called within the for loop.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may occur because the `maybe_convert_objects` function is not defined within the provided code or is not imported properly. This would result in a NameError when the function is called.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: One possible approach is to ensure that the `maybe_convert_objects` function is imported or defined within the code so that it can be called successfully.


```python
# Corrected function

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column

    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        # Replace this line with the appropriate function or method for converting objects
        converted = convert_objects(result.iloc[:, n].values)
