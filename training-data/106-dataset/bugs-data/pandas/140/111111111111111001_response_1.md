The error message 'KeyError: 0' suggests that the key '0' is not found. This issue is likely related to the problematic function `_recast_datetimelike_result`. 

The bug seems to be present in the way the `obj_cols` are being generated. The `obj_cols` variable is empty and, when used to iterate over `result`, it doesn't result in any changes. This causes issues with setting the `converted` values back into the `result.iloc[:, n]`.

The bug occurs because when defining `obj_cols`, the condition `is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])` results in an empty list, making the subsequent loop irrelevant.

To fix this issue, it is essential to correctly identify the object columns present in the dataframe.

One approach to fix this bug is to use the `select_dtypes` method to filter the DataFrame columns based on the data types and then proceed with the conversion for the filtered object columns. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    # Filter columns based on object data type
    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include=[np.object]).columns

    # Convert object columns
    for col in obj_cols:
        result[col] = maybe_convert_objects(result[col].values, convert_numeric=False)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, `select_dtypes` is used to identify the object columns in the dataframe. Then, the conversion is applied to the filtered object columns, resolving the bug.
