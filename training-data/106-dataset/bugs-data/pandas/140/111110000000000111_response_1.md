Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates through the obj_cols and tries to convert objects using `maybe_convert_objects`. This loop does not handle the case where the result's dtype is already datetime-like, which may cause issues in the provided test case.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop to convert objects using `maybe_convert_objects` does not account for datetime-like types, leading to a KeyError when applying the function in the provided test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for datetime-like types in the result's columns before trying to convert objects.
2. If a datetime-like type is found, skip the conversion process for that column.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype, is_datetime64_any_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    for n in obj_cols:
        if not is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )

            result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
