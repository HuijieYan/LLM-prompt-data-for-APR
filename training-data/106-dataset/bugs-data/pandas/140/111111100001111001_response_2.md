The error occurs in the for loop where the `result.iloc[:, n]` is being assigned to `converted`. It seems that the value is being assigned to the wrong index position.

The reason for the bug is that the loop is iterating over the `obj_cols` list which contains the index of columns with object dtype. The loop should assign the converted value to the same index in the original dataframe `result`, instead of assigning it to a fixed index position.

To fix this bug, we can modify the loop to correctly assign the converted values to the corresponding index in the `result` dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted  # assigning the converted value to the correct index

    return result
```

With this correction, the code will assign the converted values to the correct index positions in the `result` dataframe based on the `obj_cols` list.
