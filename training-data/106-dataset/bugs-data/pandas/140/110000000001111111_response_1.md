Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue is likely related to the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly in the loop where it tries to convert object types to datetime-like types.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the datetime-like columns when using the `apply()` function on a grouped DataFrame. This bug may have been introduced in a newer version of pandas (0.25.1) as a regression issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `result` DataFrame has any datetime-like columns before attempting to convert object types to datetime-like types.
2. Use more robust methods to convert object types to datetime-like types, especially when dealing with grouped DataFrames.
3. Debug the loop that converts object types to datetime-like types to ensure it is handling the data appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result):
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    if any(result.dtypes == 'datetime64[ns]'):
        result = result.copy()

        obj_cols = [
            idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
        ]

        for n in obj_cols:
            if is_object_dtype(result.iloc[:, n]):
                converted = pd.to_datetime(result.iloc[:, n], errors='coerce')
                result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result
```
