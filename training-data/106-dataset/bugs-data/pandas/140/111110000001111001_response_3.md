The potential error in the provided code is occurring within the for loop where it is trying to convert object dtypes in the DataFrame. The code is attempting to convert the object dtype to numeric using the `maybe_convert_objects` function, but it is not handling the conversion correctly, resulting in an error.

The reason for the bug is that the code is trying to convert object types to numeric without properly handling the conversion, resulting in an error when attempting to assign the converted values back to the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we can use the `pd.to_numeric` function to explicitly convert object types to numeric, which will handle the conversion properly and avoid the error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # Convert object dtypes to numeric
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = pd.to_numeric(
            result.iloc[:, n], errors='coerce'
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```
