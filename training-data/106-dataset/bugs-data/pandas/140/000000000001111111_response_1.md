Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_recast_datetimelike_result` function is intended to convert datetime-like objects in the DataFrame to a specific type. It seems that the bug might be occurring due to a mismatch in the way the conversion is being handled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify the logic for identifying datetime-like columns and ensure that the conversion is being applied correctly.
2. Check if the conversion is being applied to the correct subset of columns.
3. Handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the conversion process.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result[col])]

    for col in obj_cols:
        if result[col].dtype.name.startswith('datetime'):
            result[col] = result[col].astype('object')
    return result
```
