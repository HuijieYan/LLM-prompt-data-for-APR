The error message indicates that a KeyError is being raised when the `groupby.apply` function is called in the test case. This occurs within the `test_apply_datetime_issue` function. The error message traceback points to the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, particularly at the line `obj_cols = [...]`.

The error is likely occurring because the `result` DataFrame does not have columns with standard int values in the `obj_cols` list, and the subsequent indexing operation fails.

To fix this issue, the `obj_cols` generation process should be modified to ensure that the columns are selected properly. Additionally, the corrected function should handle the indexing properly, ensuring that it does not raise KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in result.select_dtypes(include='object').columns
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result[col].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result[col] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. We select the columns that have object dtype using `result.select_dtypes(include='object').columns` rather than iterating through all columns and checking their dtype.
2. In the for loop, we iterate through the column names directly rather than using numerical indices to access the columns, ensuring that the original issue with indexing is resolved.
