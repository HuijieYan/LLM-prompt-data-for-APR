After analyzing the error message and its relationship with the test case, it seems that the issue is originating from the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. The error message indicates a `KeyError: 0` which is likely being caused by accessing an index that does not exist.

The bug occurs when the `groupby.apply` function is used with a DataFrame containing a datetime column and different column labels. This triggers the error in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function, specifically in the obj_cols list comprehension.

To fix the bug, the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function needs to be modified to handle datetime columns and ensure that the column labels do not cause KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    # Iterate over columns and check if it's an object or datetime type
    for col in result.columns:
        if is_object_dtype(result[col]) or is_datetime64_any_dtype(result[col]):
            result[col] = maybe_convert_objects(result[col].values, convert_numeric=False)

    return result
```

This corrected code handles object and datetime types in the columns of the DataFrame and performs the necessary conversion to avoid the KeyError.
