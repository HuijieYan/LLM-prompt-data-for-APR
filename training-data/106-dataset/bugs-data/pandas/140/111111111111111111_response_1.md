The error occurs in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function which is called from the `df.groupby(['b']).apply`. The error is caused by the `obj_cols` list being empty and as a result, the loop that iterates through `obj_cols` to convert objects in the result does not execute. This leads to the result being returned as it is, causing the subsequent error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `obj_cols` list is not being populated correctly. This could be due to an issue in the logic used to identify the object columns. Additionally, the handling of `n` and `converted` variables is not clear in the provided code.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying object columns (`obj_cols`) needs to be reviewed. Additionally, the usage of `n` and `converted` variables needs to be properly implemented to ensure that object columns are being converted as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    result = result.copy()

    # Identify object columns
    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx, col in enumerate(result.columns) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[col])
    ]

    # Convert object columns
    for n in obj_cols:
        result.iloc[:, n] = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the logic for identifying object columns by using `enumerate` to loop through the columns and retrieve both the index and the column itself. Then, we update the object columns in the result using `maybe_convert_objects`.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the object columns are properly handled, resolving the KeyError issue in the test case.
