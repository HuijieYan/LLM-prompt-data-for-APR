The error is occurring in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function when trying to access the object types from the `result.dtypes` array. This is likely due to the input DataFrame `result` not having the expected structure or data type.

The bug is caused by accessing the `result.dtypes[idx]` without ensuring that the `idx` is a valid index for the `result.dtypes` array. This is leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we can first verify that the `obj_cols` list is not empty before trying to access the `result.dtypes` array. We can also combine the conversion step and assignment step for clarity and to avoid potential indexing issues.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have a date/time-like column in the original DataFrame, then coerce them as we are stacking. 
    This is necessary because the original DataFrame can easily have object dtypes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame
        The input DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Returns the modified DataFrame with possibly recast date/time-like columns.

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes GroupBy._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    if obj_cols:  # Ensure obj_cols is not empty before proceeding
        for n in obj_cols:
            converted = result.iloc[:, n].apply(lambda x: x if pd.notnull(x) else pd.NaT)
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result
```
