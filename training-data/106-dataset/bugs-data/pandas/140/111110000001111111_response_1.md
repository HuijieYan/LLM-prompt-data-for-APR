The bug seems to be occurring in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function due to the usage of `result.columns` and `result.dtypes`. The function is trying to convert object types to numeric types without considering the specific requirements for datetime-like columns.

The bug is likely occurring due to changes in the behavior of pandas from version 0.24.2 to 0.25.1. It seems that the presence of a datetime column in the dataframe is causing issues with the apply function, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle datetime-like columns properly. It should only try to convert object types to numeric types if they are not datetime-like columns. This can be achieved by checking the dtype of each column and performing the conversion only if it's not datetime-like.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype, is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx, col in enumerate(result.columns) 
        if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx]) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we use `is_datetime64_any_dtype` from `pandas.api.types` to check if a column is datetime-like. If it is, we skip the conversion, otherwise, we proceed with the conversion from object to numeric types. This should address the bug that was causing the KeyError in the apply function when using datetime columns.
