The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that iterates over obj_cols and converts the object dtype columns to numeric. The error may occur because in the given test case, the result dataframe only has one column which is identified as an object dtype column and is being converted to numeric. This can cause unexpected behavior and result in the KeyError: 0 error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the datetime column and its conversion properly, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of datetime columns and handle them separately from the object columns.
2. Ensure that the conversion of object columns to numeric does not lead to unexpected errors, especially in cases where there is only one column in the dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, is_object_dtype, maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if 'datetime' not in str(result.dtypes[n]):
            converted = maybe_convert_objects(
                result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
            )
            result.iloc[:, n] = converted

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to exclude the datetime columns from the conversion to numeric. This should prevent the unexpected behavior and errors that were encountered in the original function.
