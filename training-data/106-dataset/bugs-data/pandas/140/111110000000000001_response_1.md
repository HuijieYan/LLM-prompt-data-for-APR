The potential error in the provided code is that the function is attempting to modify the DataFrame 'result' using integer-location based indexing (iloc), which may not retain the changes in the original DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to modify the DataFrame 'result' using integer-location based indexing (iloc). However, when modifications are made using iloc, the changes may not be retained in the original DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we can use label-based indexing (loc) to modify the DataFrame 'result'. This will ensure that the changes are retained in the original DataFrame.


# Corrected function
```python
import pandas as pd

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : pd.DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = result.select_dtypes(include='object').columns

    for col in obj_cols:
        result[col] = pd.to_numeric(result[col], errors='coerce')

    return result
```
