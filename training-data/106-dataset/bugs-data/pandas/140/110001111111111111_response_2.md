The error occurs when the `result` DataFrame is processed in the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function. Specifically, the error is caused by the `obj_cols` list comprehension and the subsequent attempt to assign values to `result.iloc[:, n]`.

The error occurs because the `obj_cols` list contains the index `0`, and when trying to access `result.iloc[:, 0]`, it throws a `KeyError`, likely because the integer location indexing does not match any labels in the DataFrame.

The bug can be fixed by handling the datetime-like columns differently and not performing any operations that might lead to KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recast_datetimelike_result` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.strings.accessor import _RecodedMethods
from pandas.core.indexing import _iLocIndexer
from pandas.core.series import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        if isinstance(result.iloc[:, n], _RecodedMethods):
            # Skip if the column is a recoded string
            continue
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to skip the processing for recoded strings. This check ensures that the specific datetime-like columns that caused the issue are not processed in a way that would lead to a KeyError.
