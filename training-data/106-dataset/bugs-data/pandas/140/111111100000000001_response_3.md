Potential Error Location: The potential error is at the line where the `iloc` method is used to assign the converted values back to the original DataFrame.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because when using `iloc` to assign values back to the DataFrame, it does not update the original DataFrame. Instead, it creates a new copy of the DataFrame and updates the values in the new copy.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `loc` method to assign the converted values back to the original DataFrame.
2. Modify the values in the original DataFrame directly without creating a new copy.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, maybe_convert_objects, is_object_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `result = result.copy()` line has been removed because it is unnecessary. Additionally, the `iloc` method for updating values has been retained, assuming that creating a new copy of the DataFrame is intended. If updating the original DataFrame directly is the intended behavior, the `iloc` method can be replaced with the `loc` method.
