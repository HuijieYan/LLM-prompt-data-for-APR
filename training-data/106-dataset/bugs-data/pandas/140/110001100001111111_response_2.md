The potential error location within the problematic function is the for loop that goes through the object columns and attempts to convert the values to numeric.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the function attempts to convert the datetime-like values to numeric, it triggers a KeyError: 0 error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to skip converting the datetime-like values to numeric. This can be achieved by checking for datetime-like columns and excluding them from the conversion process.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
    """
    If we have date/time like in the original, then coerce dates
    as we are stacking can easily have object dtypes here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes Groupby._selected_obj has ndim==2 and at least one
    datetimelike column
    """
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [
        idx for idx in range(len(result.columns)) if is_object_dtype(result.dtypes[idx]) and not is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(result.dtypes[idx])
    ]

    # See GH#26285
    for n in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(
            result.iloc[:, n].values, convert_numeric=False
        )

        result.iloc[:, n] = converted
    return result
```

This corrected function now checks for datetime-like columns and skips converting them, which should resolve the KeyError: 0 error that was occurring.
