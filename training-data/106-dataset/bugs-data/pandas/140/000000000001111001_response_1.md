The bug in the given function is likely due to the incorrect way of iterating through the columns and modifying the values. The 'obj_cols' list is being populated with the index of columns where the dtype is an object. However, when it comes to modifying these columns, the function is trying to use the index directly without considering the possibility of non-consecutive or non-zero-based index values. This can lead to incorrect modifications in the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we should iterate through the columns using the column names directly, and then apply the conversion to each column.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype
from pandas.api.types import maybe_convert_objects

def _recast_datetimelike_result(result: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    result = result.copy()

    obj_cols = [col for col in result.columns if is_object_dtype(result[col])]

    for col in obj_cols:
        converted = maybe_convert_objects(result[col].values, convert_numeric=False)
        result[col] = converted

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the column names directly and then apply the conversion to each column using the column name. This approach is more reliable and should fix the bug in the original code.
