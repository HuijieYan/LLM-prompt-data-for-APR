The buggy function `_get_with` is a part of the Pandas library, and it seems to be used for indexing a Series object with a key. The error message from the test function indicates that the function is not raising a `ValueError` when it should.

The potential location of the bug is within the logic that handles the `ndarray` type key. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the multidimensional key (`nd3` in this case) and is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of multidimensional keys or not checking the number of dimensions properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the number of dimensions of the key and raise a `ValueError` if it does not match the expected dimension.
2. Handle multidimensional keys appropriately and provide meaningful error messages if the key is not compatible with the indexing operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim != 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")
    
    # existing logic
    # ...
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle multidimensional keys and raise a `ValueError` when the key is not suitable for indexing.
