The problematic function `_get_with` seems to be designed to handle different types of keys and access the data accordingly. However, it appears that the code is trying to handle multiple cases in the `if-else` ladder, which has made the function complicated and prone to errors. 

The presence of several condition checks, mixed with a nested hierarchy of `if-elif-else` statements, could lead to complexity and confusion. It appears that the code is trying to handle different data types, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc., which makes it difficult to follow and understand.

A possible approach to fixing this bug could involve refactoring the code to simplify the logic. For example, using a series of separate functions or methods for each type of key handling could enhance readability and maintainability.

Here's a simplified and refactored version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Handle other cases or raise an appropriate error
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In this refactored version, the code has been simplified by breaking down different key types into separate conditions and handling them appropriately. This can make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Also, it avoids nested conditionals and reduces complexity.

Overall, refactoring the complicated logic of the original function into simpler, separate functions or methods can lead to easier-to-understand code, which can help in debugging and maintaining the functionality in the future.
