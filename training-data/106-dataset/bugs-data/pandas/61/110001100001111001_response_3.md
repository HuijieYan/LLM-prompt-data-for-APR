The buggy function has a conditional statement at the beginning that checks the type of the input `key` and then takes different actions based on the type. The bug could be occurring due to incorrect handling or processing of the `key` variable within the function, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that all the conditional checks and the subsequent actions based on those checks are correctly handling the input `key` of the function. This may involve correcting the logic within the conditional statements and also addressing any potential issues related to the methods being called based on the type of `key`.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._slice(key)
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # Process based on the type of key
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
                indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
                return self.iloc[indexer]
            else:
                return self._get_values(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function now includes proper handling for different types of `key` and ensures that the appropriate methods are called based on the type of the input `key`.
