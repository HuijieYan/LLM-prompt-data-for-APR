The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the function under test is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

The potential error in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the handling of multidimensional keys. The function is trying to index a Series with a multidimensional key (nd3), and it should raise a `ValueError` according to the test case.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle the case of a multidimensional key appropriately, and it fails to raise the expected `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should include a check for multidimensional keys and raise a `ValueError` when such keys are encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, tuple) and any(isinstance(val, (list, np.ndarray)) for val in key):
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    # existing code for handling other cases

    # code for handling multidimensional keys
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    if isinstance(key, list) and any(isinstance(val, np.ndarray) and val.ndim > 1 for val in key):
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    # existing code for handling other cases
```

In this corrected version, the function specifically checks for multidimensional keys as numpy arrays or lists containing numpy arrays with more than one dimension. If such keys are encountered, it raises a `ValueError` as expected according to the test case.
