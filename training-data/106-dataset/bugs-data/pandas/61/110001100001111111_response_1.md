The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different scenarios based on the type of the `key` parameter, but its current implementation is causing errors.

Looking at the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the code block that handles a `tuple` type for the `key` parameter. It checks if the `key` is a tuple and then tries to call `self._get_values_tuple(key)`. The problem is that the logic inside the `if isinstance(key, tuple)` block is overly complex and confusing. The function tries to handle too many different scenarios within this block, which makes it error-prone.

To fix this, the logic inside the `if isinstance(key, tuple)` block should be refactored and simplified. It should be split into more manageable and understandable parts to handle different scenarios separately.

Here's the suggested corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # handle tuples
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle a 1-tuple
            if len(key) == 1:
                subkey = key[0]
                if isinstance(subkey, slice):
                    return self._get_values(subkey)
            raise
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
            return self.iloc[indexer]

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
            # [slice(0, 5, None)] will break if you convert to ndarray
            # e.g. as requested by np.median
            # FIXME: hack
            return self._get_values(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This refactored code separates the handling of tuples into a distinct and more readable block, reducing the complexity and making it easier to understand and maintain. This refactored code should help address the potential issues and improve the overall robustness of the function.
