Upon analyzing the problematic function `_get_with`, it seems that the bug occurs in the following block of code:

```python
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
```

The bug occurs because the code assumes that `key` is always an iterable, but it does not handle the case when `key` is not an iterable type.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `key` is not iterable, and if it's not, convert it to a list. Additionally, we can handle the case when `key` is an instance of `Index` separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

With this modification, we handle the case when `key` is not iterable by converting it to a list, and continue with the rest of the code as before.
