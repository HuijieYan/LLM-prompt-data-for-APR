The potential error in the code is that the function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of inputs (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) using multiple if-elif-else conditions. This can lead to confusion and make the code difficult to maintain and debug.

The bug occurs because the function tries to handle different key types separately, resulting in redundant and complicated implementation. The code also lacks proper error handling for some cases.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the implementation by using a single approach to handle all types of keys. We can use the `try-except` block to catch any errors and handle them consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    try:
        # Try to use loc for most of the key types
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, IndexError, ValueError):
        # If loc fails, try to handle other key types
        if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
            # Handle the dup indexing case
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
                # [slice(0, 5, None)] will break if you convert to ndarray,
                # e.g. as requested by np.median
                return self._get_values(key)
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code simplifies the implementation by using a single approach to handle different key types and provides proper error handling using the `try-except` block.
