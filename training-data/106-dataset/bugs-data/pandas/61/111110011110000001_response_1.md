The error message is indicating that the test case did not raise the expected `ValueError` when calling the `idxr[nd3]` method. The test case is designed to check the behavior of the `idxr` object when using an ndarray `nd3` with the `getitem` method. It's expected that this method should raise a `ValueError` under certain conditions, which is not currently happening.

The potential error in the provided code is within the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The `if` condition and related code might not be handling all the possible cases of the `key` parameter correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior in the test case.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to:
- Insufficient handling of different types of `key` parameters (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.).
- Incorrect assumptions about the structure and type of the `key` parameter, leading to inappropriate control flow within the method.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` method needs to be updated to appropriately handle different types of `key` parameters. This could involve restructuring the conditional branches and adding specific handling for different types of keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
                return self._get_values(key[0])
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
            return self.iloc[indexer]
        else:
            return self._get_values(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) and len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
        return self._get_values(key[0])

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, additional checks and handling have been added for different types of `key` parameters, ensuring that the method can appropriately handle various scenarios and provide the expected behavior without error.
