The potential error in the problematic function is in the logic to handle different types of keys. The code tries to handle different key types like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc. However, the handling of these different types of keys is not implemented correctly, leading to potential errors.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to refactor the logic for handling different key types, ensuring that each type is handled properly and gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    # handling DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    # handling tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
            return self._get_values(key[0])
        else:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # handling other types of keys
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```
