The error occurs in the method `_get_with` of the `Series` class. The method is intended to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists or arrays. However, the implementation has some issues, resulting in the failure of the test cases.

The error occurs because the logic of the `_get_with` method is not handling the multidimensional key `nd3` properly. It tries to index the `Series` object with a multidimensional array, causing the test to fail with a `ValueError` as expected.

To fix this, the method needs to be updated to handle multidimensional keys properly. It seems like the method should not accept multidimensional keys and raise an error if such keys are provided. However, this depends on the intended behavior of the method, which might need clarification from the original developer or the project's documentation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) and key.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")
    
    # rest of the method implementation
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, an additional check is added to prevent multidimensional keys from being used. If a multidimensional key is provided, a `ValueError` is raised, which aligns with the behavior expected by the test cases.
