The buggy function, `_get_with`, seems to incorrectly handle different data types for the `key` variable. It attempts to identify the `key` data type and then proceeds with different operations based on that. However, it seems like it is not performing the correct operations for each data type.

The function should handle different data types for `key` more gracefully, ensuring that appropriate operations are carried out based on the data type.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function can be as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    # handle dataframe
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    # handle tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if it's a 1-tuple, try to handle as a single value
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
                return self._get_values(key[0])
            raise
    # handle other types
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self._get_values(key)
    # handle index type
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(self.index, pd.IntervalIndex):
                indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
                return self.iloc[indexer]
            else:
                return self._get_values(key)
    # reindex for others
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected code will handle different data types for `key` more effectively and perform appropriate operations based on the data type.
