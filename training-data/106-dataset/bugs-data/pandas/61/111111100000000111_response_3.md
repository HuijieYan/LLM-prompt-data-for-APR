The potential error in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle all possible cases of the `key` parameter correctly. The function does not handle the case where `key` is a list, numpy array, Series, or Index effectively.

The bug occurs because the function tries to handle various types of input keys, but it does not cover all possible cases, leading to potential errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should handle all possible cases of the `key` parameter, including lists, numpy arrays, Series, and Index, to ensure that it can handle a wide range of input types correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
