The error message indicates that there was an issue when trying to access an array with the buggy function. The function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of input keys and return the appropriate data based on the key type. However, there are multiple issues with this function.

Based on the error messages and the test function, the bug likely occurs in the section of the function where it tries to handle different key types. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the key type and is encountering issues when trying to process the key.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Incorrect identification of key types leading to issues with processing the key.
2. Lack of proper error handling for different key types.

To fix the buggy function, it's important to accurately identify the key type and handle it appropriately. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle unexpected or invalid key types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.is_integer() or self.index.is_floating():
                return self.loc[key]
            elif isinstance(self.index, IntervalIndex):
                indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
                return self.iloc[indexer]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we have explicitly handled the different possible key types and their appropriate actions. Additionally, error handling for invalid key types has been implemented.
