The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect indexing or slicing of the Series `self` using the provided `key`. This error occurs because the code does not properly handle various types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, and specific data types.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the type of `key` and handle each type appropriately, including error handling for unsupported operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)  # Correctly handle slicing

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)  # Handle tuple indexing
        except ValueError:
            # Handle exceptions when accessing with a tuple
            if len(key) == 1:
                if isinstance(key[0], slice):
                    return self._get_values(key[0])  # Handle single slice within a tuple
                else:
                    return self.loc[key]  # Handle regular tuple indexing

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle indexing with lists, NumPy arrays, other Series objects, or Index objects
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)  # Handle reindexing for unsupported types
```

In the corrected code, each type of `key` is properly handled, and appropriate actions are taken based on the type of `key`. This should fix the bug and provide a more robust `_get_with` function.
