The provided test function tests the `getitem` functionality for 3-dimensional arrays, with a specific error message that is expected to be raised. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

After analyzing the provided function `_get_with`, it seems that the function may not handle the indexing of 3-dimensional arrays correctly. This is likely the cause of the failure in the test function and the error message.

The reason behind the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not have proper handling for 3-dimensional array indexing.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle the indexing of 3-dimensional arrays properly. It should check the dimensions of the index array and, if it is 3-dimensional, raise a `ValueError` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with a multidimensional key")

    # the rest of the original logic for handling other types of keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            # if we don't have a MultiIndex, we may still be able to handle
            #  a 1-tuple.  see test_1tuple_without_multiindex
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise

    # the rest of the original logic
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the indexing of 3-dimensional arrays and raise an appropriate `ValueError` when needed. This should resolve the issue with the failing test case.
