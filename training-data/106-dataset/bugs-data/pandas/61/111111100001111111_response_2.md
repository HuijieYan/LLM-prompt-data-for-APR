The problematic function `_get_with` seems to have issues with handling different types of keys (e.g., ndarray for indexing) and returning the appropriate data based on the type of key.

The potential error location could be the section where the code is trying to handle different types of keys. For example, when the key is an ndarray, the function needs to ensure that it is handled correctly and the appropriate values are returned.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the different types of keys properly. When the key is an ndarray, the function should be able to use the elements of the ndarray to index the Series and return the corresponding values.

One approach to fixing the bug is to implement a check for the type of key at the beginning of the function. Based on the type of key (e.g., ndarray, slice, etc.), the function should call the appropriate methods to retrieve the data.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self[key]
    # Handle other types of keys (e.g., slice, tuple, etc.)
    # ...
```

This code snippet ensures that when the key is an ndarray, it is used to directly index the Series and return the values. For other types of keys, the function should have appropriate handling to retrieve the data.
