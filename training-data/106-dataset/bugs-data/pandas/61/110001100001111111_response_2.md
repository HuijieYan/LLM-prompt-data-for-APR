The provided function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys and perform specific actions based on their types. However, the implementation is inconsistent and has multiple issues with type handling.

The function checks for the type of the `key` parameter and routes the execution to different methods (`_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, `_get_values`, etc.) based on the key type. However, the actual implementation is not correct, leading to potential errors.

Potential Bug Location:
- The main issue lies in the inconsistent handling of different key types and the `if-elif` block structure in the function.

Reasons for the Bug:
- The function's implementation does not cover all possible cases and does not handle various key types uniformly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a consistent approach to handle different key types. This might involve using a dictionary-based approach to map key types to corresponding actions.
2. Use proper exception handling to catch any unhandled key types and provide meaningful error messages.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                sub_key = key[0]
                if isinstance(sub_key, slice):
                    return self._slice(sub_key)
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self._get_values(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type for indexing the Series")
```

In this corrected implementation, all key types are handled uniformly with proper exception handling.
