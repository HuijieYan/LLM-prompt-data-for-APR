The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The function seems to be trying to handle slicing, tuples, and other index types.

Based on the input parameters and the expected values, it seems that the `_get_with` function is not properly handling the key type 'ndarray'. The function should handle this type of input key and return a Series accordingly.

The potential issue with the code seems to be in the handling of the key type 'ndarray'. The function does not have a specific case to handle the 'ndarray' input type, which results in the function not returning the expected value and type.

To fix the bug, we can add a case to the function to handle the 'ndarray' input type. We can use the numpy array operations to convert the ndarray to a list of values and then pass it to the appropriate method for indexing.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function can include a case for handling the 'ndarray' input type as shown below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1:
                key = key[0]
                if isinstance(key, slice):
                    return self._get_values(key)
            raise
    
    # Add a case to handle 'ndarray' input type
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        flattened_key = key.flatten()
        return self.loc[flattened_key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Rest of the existing logic 
    # ...
```

By adding a case to handle the 'ndarray' input type, we ensure that this input type is appropriately handled and the function returns the expected Series.
