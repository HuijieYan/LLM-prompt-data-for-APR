The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle all possible types of input for the 'key' parameter. The function is trying to determine the type of the 'key' parameter and perform different actions based on its type, but it is missing some cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called with certain types of input.

To fix the bug, we need to handle all possible types of input for the 'key' parameter and take appropriate actions based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the '_get_with' function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        try:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        except ValueError:
            if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], slice):
                return self._get_values(key[0])
            raise
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, I have added an additional condition to check if the 'key' parameter is of type pd.DataFrame, and raised a TypeError to indicate that indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported. I have also added a condition to directly handle cases where the 'key' parameter is a list, numpy array, Series, or Index, and used the 'loc' indexer to retrieve the values. For all other cases, the function falls back to reindexing the Series with the provided 'key' parameter.
