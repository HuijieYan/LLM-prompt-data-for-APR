The error occurs in the test function `test_getitem_ndarray_3d` where it is trying to test the behavior of the `idxr` when passed a 3-dimensional numpy array (`nd3`). The test is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function is not raising the expected error, leading to test failures.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where `idxr[nd3]` is being called. The function is expected to raise a `ValueError` when `nd3` is a 3-dimensional array, but it is not doing so.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the function is not correctly handling the case of a 3-dimensional array input for indexing.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the case when a 3-dimensional array is passed for indexing. It should raise a `ValueError` for this case to match the expectations in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim > 2:
        raise ValueError("Cannot index with multidimensional key")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding this check and raising a `ValueError` if the number of dimensions in the input array is greater than 2, the function will now behave as expected and the test cases should pass without errors.
