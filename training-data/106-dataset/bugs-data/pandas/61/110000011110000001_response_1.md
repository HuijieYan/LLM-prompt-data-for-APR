The function `_get_with` has multiple issues that may be causing the errors in the test cases. Some potential issues in the function include the handling of different key types and the indexing operations. The reason for the bug may be due to improper handling of multidimensional keys.

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to properly handle multidimensional keys by raising a ValueError when such keys are encountered. Additionally, the handling of different key types such as boolean, categorical, and datetime can be improved for consistency.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        raise ValueError("Tuple keys are not supported")

    if isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.MultiIndex)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing with DataFrame or MultiIndex is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

This updated code provides a clear and consistent approach to handling different types of keys, and properly raises errors for unsupported key types, including multidimensional keys, tuples, DataFrames, and MultiIndexes.
