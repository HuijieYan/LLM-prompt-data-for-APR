The error message indicates that the merge operation is failing due to incompatible merge keys between the left and right DataFrames. The error specifies that the merge keys have different types, which is causing the failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the extraction of merge keys from the left and right DataFrames, as indicated by the error message.

The bug occurred because the function was not checking the types of the merge keys from the left and right DataFrames before attempting the merge operation, leading to incompatible merge keys.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to include a type check for the merge keys from the left and right DataFrames. If the merge keys have different types, it should raise an error to indicate the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    # Check if the left and right keys are compatible
    left_key_type = type(left.index)
    right_key_type = type(right.index)
    if left_key_type != right_key_type:
        raise MergeError(f"Incompatible merge keys: {left_key_type} and {right_key_type} must be the same type")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

The modification includes the addition of a type check for the merge keys from the left and right DataFrames. If the types are different, it raises a MergeError to indicate the issue.
