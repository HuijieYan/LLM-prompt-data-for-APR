The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys, specifically the data types, in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `pd.merge_asof()` function.

The potential error location within the `_get_merge_keys` method is likely the comparison of data types when it validates the index types are the same. It is trying to compare the data types of the left and right keys, raising a `MergeError` when they are not the same type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the different data types of the left and right keys appropriately. It is assuming that the data types should be the same, leading to the error during the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function compares the data types of the left and right keys. This can involve implementing type checks and handling different data types separately.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Add type checks to handle different data types of left and right keys
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if lk.dtype != rk.dtype:
            if pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(lk.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
