The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_merge_keys` method, specifically in the logic that handles the comparison of data types of the left and right join keys.

The error occurs because the data type of the left index keys (dtype('<M8[ns]') representing datetime) and the data type of the right index keys (datetime64[ns, UTC]) are being compared, and they are not matching.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for data types needs to be adjusted to handle datetime indices with different timezones. This can be achieved by converting both the left and right index keys to the same timezone before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    # Existing code...

    # Convert the left and right index keys to the same timezone for comparison
    left_join_keys = [key.tz_convert(right.index.tz) for key in left_join_keys]
    right_join_keys = [key.tz_convert(right.index.tz) for key in right_join_keys]

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

With the corrected code, the left and right join keys are converted to the same timezone before comparison, ensuring that their data types match for a successful comparison.
