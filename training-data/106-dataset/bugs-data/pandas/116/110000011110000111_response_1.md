The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys and the expected merge keys' dtype should be the same type.

The potential error location is within the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `pd.merge_asof` function as indicated in the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the dtype of the merge keys is not the same, leading to the incompatible merge keys error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the merge keys' dtypes are the same type before merging.
2. Updating the `_get_merge_keys` method to handle the different types of merge keys properly and ensure their compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    # (remaining code for extracting merge keys not included)

    # updating the merge keys' dtypes to ensure compatibility
    left_keys = [pd.to_datetime(lk) if lk.dtype.kind == "M" else lk for lk in left_keys]
    right_keys = [pd.to_datetime(rk) if rk.dtype.kind == "M" else rk for rk in right_keys]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the merge keys are converted to the same datetime dtype to avoid incompatible merge key errors.
