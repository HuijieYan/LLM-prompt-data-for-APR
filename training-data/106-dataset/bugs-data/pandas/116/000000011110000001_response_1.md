The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof` function is called with the `left_index=True` and `right_on=["from_date"]`. This function is used to perform an asof merge on the provided DataFrames based on the index of the left DataFrame and the "from_date" column of the right DataFrame.

The issue lies within the `_get_merge_keys` function where it fails to handle the case when `left_index=True` and `right_on` is provided. Specifically, it fails to handle the different date-time types of the index and the "from_date" column, leading to the MergeError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `left_index=True` and `right_on` is provided. The date-time type compatibility between the index and the "from_date" column should be checked and handled accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    
    left, right = self.left, self.right
    
    # existing code...

    if _any(self.left_on) and _any(self.right_on):
        # existing code...
    elif _any(self.left_on) and self.right_on == [None] * len(self.right_on) and self.right.index.name in self.left_on:
        # If left_on references the right index, handle it separately
        idx_name = self.right.index.name
        left_keys = [left.index.values]
        right_keys = [right.index.values]
        join_names = [idx_name]

    # remaining code...

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This modification includes a new condition to handle the case when `left_index=True` and `right_on=None` (i.e., referring to the right index). It populates the `left_keys`, `right_keys`, and `join_names` accordingly.
