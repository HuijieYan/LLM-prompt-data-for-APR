The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof` function is called. The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys. The keys should have the same type, but they are of different types: `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

The bug is occurring within the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class in the `merge.py` file. The issue seems to be with mismatched data types when comparing the keys.

To fix the bug:
1. We can ensure that the left and right join keys have the same type before performing the comparison.
2. The keys may need to be converted to the same type if they are not already of the same type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = [self.left.index]
    right_keys = [self.right[self.right_on[0]]]  # Assuming there's only one column in right_on
    join_names = self.right_on

    # Convert both keys to the same type if necessary
    if not np.issubdtype(left_keys[0].dtype, right_keys[0].dtype):
        right_keys = [pd.to_datetime(right_keys[0])]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly set the left keys to be the index of the `left` DataFrame and the right keys to be the column specified in the `right_on` parameter. Then, before returning the keys, we check if they are of the same type. If they are not, we convert the right keys to the same type as the left keys using `pd.to_datetime`. This will ensure that the keys have the same type and will resolve the issue of incompatible merge keys.
