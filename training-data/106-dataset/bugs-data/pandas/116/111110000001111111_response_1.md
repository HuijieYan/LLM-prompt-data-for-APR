The bug appears in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_MergeOperation` class. It seems to be related to the handling of datetime indexes and columns when merging DataFrames.

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the case where one index is a timezone-aware datetime index and the other is a regular datetime index. The code is expecting both indexes to have the same dtype, and when they don't, it raises a `MergeError` due to incompatible merge keys.

To fix the bug:
1. The code needs to handle the case where one index is a timezone-aware datetime index and the other is a regular datetime index.
2. It also needs to ensure that the merge keys have the same type, irrespective of the presence or absence of timezone information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right
    for key, is_left in [(self.left_on, True), (self.right_on, False)]:
        key_arr = np.array(key)
        indexer, key = self._get_indexers([key_arr], is_left=is_left)

        if is_left:
            left_keys.append(key)
            join_names.append(None)
        else:
            right_keys.append(right.index.take(indexer))
            join_names.append(None)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

This corrected code should ensure that the merge keys are handled appropriately, regardless of the timezone information in the datetime indexes.
