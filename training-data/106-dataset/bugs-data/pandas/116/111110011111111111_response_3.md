Based on the error message and the test case, it seems that the issue is occurring while merging a left DataFrame with an index and a right DataFrame with a specific column. The error message "incompatible merge keys [0] dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], must be the same type" suggests that there is a type mismatch between the merge keys.

The issue is occurring at the `_get_merge_keys()` function, which is responsible for identifying the merge keys for the left and right DataFrames.

The problem arises because the `index` of the left DataFrame is of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]` and the `right_on` column of the right DataFrame is also of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. However, during the merge operation, there's a type mismatch that leads to the error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the types of the merge keys (left and right) are compatible before proceeding with the merge operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
  
    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if self.left_index:
        left_keys.append(left.index)
        join_names.append(None)
    else:
        for on in self.left_on:
            left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(on))
            join_names.append(on)  # Use the name of the column

    if self.right_index:
        right_keys.append(right.index)
        join_names.append(None)
    else:
        for on in self.right_on:
            right_keys.append(right[on])
            join_names.append(on)  # Use the name of the column

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly handle the cases for left and right index based on the boolean flags `self.left_index` and `self.right_index`. If the DataFrame has an index, we append it directly to the left/right keys list. Otherwise, we get the label or level values from the DataFrames for the specified merge key.

By ensuring that the types of merge keys are handled correctly, we can avoid the type incompatibility issue and the function should work as expected.
