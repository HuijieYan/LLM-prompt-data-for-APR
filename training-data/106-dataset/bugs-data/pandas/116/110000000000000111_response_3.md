The issue is with the `_get_merge_keys` method in the code.

At first glance, the error message "incompatible merge keys [0] dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], must be the same type" indicates that the function is failing to correctly handle timezone-aware datetime indexes.

Upon further examination, we can see that the function does not have parameters `left`, `right`, or `on` defined, which should be inputs and not comments, considering the error message. This could be the potential location of the bug.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function treats `left` and `right` as attributes rather than parameters. Therefore, it fails to process the inputs correctly, resulting in the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to accept the necessary parameters `left`, `right`, and `on` and use them to extract the keys for a merge properly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, on):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    is_lkey = lambda x: is_array_like(x) and len(x) == len(left)
    is_rkey = lambda x: is_array_like(x) and len(x) == len(right)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By modifying the function to accept `left`, `right`, and `on` as parameters and using these parameters appropriately throughout the function, we can ensure that it handles timezone-aware datetime indexes correctly.
