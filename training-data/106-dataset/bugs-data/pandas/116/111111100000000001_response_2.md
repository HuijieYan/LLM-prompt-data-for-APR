The error in this code may occur due to the use of the `_any` function without it being defined. This may result in a NameError when the function is called.

To fix this bug, you can define the `_any` function or replace its usage with the intended functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, on):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys
    """
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    is_lkey = lambda x: isinstance(x, (list, tuple)) and len(x) == len(left)
    is_rkey = lambda x: isinstance(x, (list, tuple)) and len(x) == len(right)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, I have changed the `_any` function to checks whether the input is a list or tuple and whether its length matches the input DataFrame. I have also removed the reference to `self.left_on` and `self.right_on` as method arguments since they were not provided as parameters to the method. If these variables are supposed to be attributes of the class, then they should be used as `self.left_on` and `self.right_on` throughout the method.
