Potential error location: The _get_merge_keys function seems to be the source of the problem, as it is responsible for merging the left and right dataframes based on specified keys.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message "incompatible merge keys [0] dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC], must be the same type" indicates that there is a mismatch in the data types of the merge keys.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the data types of merge keys from both left and right dataframes are consistent.
2. Allow for conversion of data types if necessary to make merge keys compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    for lk in self.left_on:
        left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(lk))
        join_names.append(lk)

    for rk in self.right_on:
        right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
        join_names.append(rk)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
