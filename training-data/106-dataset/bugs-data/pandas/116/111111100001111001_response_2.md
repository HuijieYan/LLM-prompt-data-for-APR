The bug occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_MergeOperation` class. This method is intended to return left_keys, right_keys, and join_names, but due to the presence of nested conditional statements and if-else conditions, there can be multiple break points where it may not return the expected outputs.

The causes of the bug could include:
1. Incorrect conditional checks using the `_any` function.
2. Mishandling of conditions for populating `left_keys` and `right_keys`.
3. Unnecessary complexity of conditional statements leading to redundant code.

To fix the bug, the nested conditional statements and if-else conditions need to be simplified and properly organized to ensure that the left_keys, right_keys, and join_names are populated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(self.left_on, self.right_on)):
        if lk is None:
            left_keys.append(self.left.index)
            join_names.append(self.left.index.name)
        else:
            left_keys.append(self.left[lk])

        if rk is None:
            right_keys.append(self.right.index)
            join_names.append(self.right.index.name)
        else:
            right_keys.append(self.right[rk])
        
    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code:
1. The nested conditional statements and lambda functions have been removed.
2. The code has been simplified to use a clearer approach for populating the left_keys and right_keys lists based on the left_on and right_on attributes.
3. The function now iterates over the left_on and right_on lists and checks for None values to populate the keys appropriately.

This should address the issues with the original buggy function and provide the expected output for the test cases mentioned.
