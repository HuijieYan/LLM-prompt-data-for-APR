The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof()` function is called with the `left_index=True` and `right_on=["from_date"]`. The bug seems to be within the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The error message indicates that there's an issue with incompatible merge keys related to the data type.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the different time zone information between the left and right merge keys. When working with time series data in different time zones, it's important to ensure that all timestamps have the same time zone information.

To fix this bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method needs to handle the time zone information properly and ensure that the merge keys have the same data type. This can be achieved by converting the merge keys to the same time zone and data type before performing the merge.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
from pandas.errors import MergeError
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype

def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = self.left.index
    right_keys = self.right[self.right_on[0]]

    # Ensure that both left and right keys are in the same time zone
    right_keys = right_keys.dt.tz_convert(left_keys.tz)

    # Ensure that both left and right keys have the same data type (datetime64[ns])
    if not is_datetime64_any_dtype(left_keys) or not is_datetime64_any_dtype(right_keys):
        raise MergeError("Merge keys must be of type datetime64[ns]")

    join_names = [self.right_on[0]]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

With this corrected code, the bug related to the incompatible merge keys with different data types and time zones should be resolved.
