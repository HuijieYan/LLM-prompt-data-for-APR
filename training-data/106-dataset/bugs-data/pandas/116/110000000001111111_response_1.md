The issue seems to be related to the `pd.merge_asof()` function not working correctly when merging DataFrames with timezone-aware indices. It also fails when merging a DataFrame with a datetime column of dtype `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. The error message indicates that the incompatible merge keys have different data types, with one being `datetime64[ns]` and the other being `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

The issue arises from the `_get_merge_keys()` method within the pandas library. The method fails to handle timezone-aware DateTimeIndex properly, leading to the incompatible merge keys error.

To fix this issue, the `_get_merge_keys()` method should be modified to handle timezone-aware indices and datetime columns correctly. The method should ensure that the merge keys have the same datatype before performing the merge operation.

Here is the corrected `_get_merge_keys()` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys, join_names
    """
    left_keys = self.left.index
    right_keys = self.right[self.right_on[0]]
    join_names = [self.right_on[0]]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected method, `left_keys` are set as the index of the left DataFrame, `right_keys` are set as the specified column from the right DataFrame, and `join_names` are set as the specified column name. This ensures that the merge keys have the same datatype and will resolve the incompatible merge keys error.

With this correction, the `pd.merge_asof()` function should work correctly when merging DataFrame with timezone-aware indices and datetime columns of datatype `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.
