The potential error location in the `self._get_merge_keys()` method where the merge keys are being determined.

The error occurred because the `left_join_keys` and `right_join_keys` generated by the `_get_merge_keys` method are of different types. Specifically, `left_join_keys` is of type `datetime64[ns]` while `right_join_keys` is of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. This inconsistency leads to a `MergeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `left_join_keys` and `right_join_keys` have the same type before returning them from the `_get_merge_keys` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    """
    Note: has side effects (copy/delete key columns)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left
    right
    on

    Returns
    -------
    left_keys, right_keys, join_names
    """
    left_keys = self.left.index
    right_keys = self.right["_get_label_or_level_values"](self.right_on[0])
    join_names = [self.right_on[0]]

    # Ensure that both left_keys and right_keys are of the same type
    if not left_keys.dtype == right_keys.dtype:
        right_keys = right_keys.astype(left_keys.dtype)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

With this correction, the bug should be resolved, and the merge keys will have consistent types, preventing the `MergeError` from occurring.
