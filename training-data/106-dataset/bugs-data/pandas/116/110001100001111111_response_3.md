The bug is occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The issue is due to the mismatch of datetime types between the left and right keys, causing the `MergeError` when merging.

The reason behind this bug is that when dealing with TZ-aware DateTimeIndex and DataFrame, there might be inconsistencies in the way the datetime types are handled, leading to the MergeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the datetime types are consistent between the left and right keys before merging. One possible approach is to convert datetime types to a consistent format to avoid the MergeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    left_keys = [
        left.index.values.astype('datetime64[ns]')
    ]

    if isinstance(self.right.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        right_keys = [
            self.right.index.values.astype('datetime64[ns]')
        ]
    else:
        right_keys = [self.right.index]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert the left and right index values to `datetime64[ns]` format to ensure consistency. This should address the mismatch issue and prevent the occurrence of the MergeError.
