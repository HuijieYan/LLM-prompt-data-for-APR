The error message indicates that there is an issue with incompatible merge keys. The error occurs when trying to merge two DataFrames `left` and `right` using `pd.merge_asof()` with `left_index=True` and `right_on=["from_date"]`.

The problem is within the `_get_merge_keys()` method of the `_MergeOperation` class. There is a mismatch in the data types of the merge keys, which causes the `MergeError`.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the left and right keys. The function should correctly handle the left and right keys and validate that they have the same data type. If the data types differ, it should raise a error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_merge_keys()` method to handle the keys correctly and ensure that they have the same data type.

Here's the corrected `_get_merge_keys()` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self, left, right, left_on, right_on):
    left_keys = left.index if left_on is None else left[left_on]
    right_keys = right[right_on]
    
    if not left_keys.dtype == right_keys.dtype:
        raise MergeError("Incompatible merge keys. Left and right keys must be the same type.")

    return left_keys, right_keys
```

In this corrected method, the merge keys are appropriately handled based on whether they are derived from the index or specified columns. Then, the data types of left and right keys are validated, and a `MergeError` is raised if they are not the same type.
