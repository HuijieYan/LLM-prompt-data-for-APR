The error is occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class which is called within the `pd.merge_asof` function. The error is related to the compatibility of merge keys' data types. It appears that the data type of the left and right keys are expected to match, but they are considered incompatible due to one being of type `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and the other being of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

The bug is occurring due to a mismatch between the data types of the keys. It seems that during the merge process, the data types of the keys are not being aligned, leading to the incompatibility issue.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the data types of the keys are aligned and compatible before performing the merge. This could involve standardizing the data types to a common format before the merge operation.

Here's the corrected `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
# Corrected _get_merge_keys method
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    # Your existing code goes here

    # Standardize data types
    left_keys = [key.astype('datetime64[ns]') if isinstance(key, pd.Series) else np.array(key, dtype='datetime64[ns]') for key in left_keys]
    right_keys = [key.astype('datetime64[ns]') if isinstance(key, pd.Series) else np.array(key, dtype='datetime64[ns]') for key in right_keys]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected method, after extracting the keys, a standardization step is performed to ensure that the data types of the keys are aligned and compatible. This is achieved by converting all keys to the `datetime64[ns]` data type. It ensures that the merge keys have the same data type and makes the merge operation compatible.
