The potential error in the given function is that it is not structured properly, and it seems to have some logical errors and potential bugs in its implementation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there are multiple logical conditions and nested if-else statements, which make it difficult to follow the flow of the code. This leads to potential bugs and errors that might not be easily identifiable.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the function and break down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions. This will help in identifying and fixing the issues step by step without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the code.

Another approach is to add more descriptive comments to the code to explain the purpose of each logical block and condition. This will help in understanding the code and identifying potential bugs more easily.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    if _any(self.left_on) and _any(self.right_on):
        for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
            if is_lkey(lk):
                left_keys.append(lk)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(lk))
            if is_rkey(rk):
                right_keys.append(rk)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
            join_names.append(None)  # what to do?

    elif _any(self.left_on):
        for k in self.left_on:
            if is_lkey(k):
                left_keys.append(k)
                join_names.append(None)
            else:
                left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(k))
                join_names.append(k)
        right_keys = [self.right.index._values]

    elif _any(self.right_on):
        for k in self.right_on:
            if is_rkey(k):
                right_keys.append(k)
                join_names.append(None)
            else:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(k))
                join_names.append(k)
        left_keys = [self.left.index.values]

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, the logical conditions and nested statements have been simplified to improve readability and maintainability. The logic for handling left_keys, right_keys, and join_names has been simplified and made more straightforward.
