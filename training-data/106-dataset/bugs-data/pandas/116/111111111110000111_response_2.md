The test case `test_merge_index_column_tz` is trying to use the `pd.merge_asof` function to merge two DataFrames `left` and `right` on the left index and the `from_date` column from the right DataFrame. The error message indicates that there is an issue with different data types in the merge keys, specifically with the left index of type `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and the `from_date` column of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. This mismatch causes a `MergeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_MergeOperation` class. The method is responsible for extracting and validating the merge keys for the operation. It seems that the method is not handling timezone-aware datetime objects correctly, leading to the mismatch in data types.

The reason behind the bug is the mishandling of timezone-aware datetime objects during the merge operation. The `pd.merge_asof` function is not properly handling the timezone information, leading to a mismatch in data types between the left index and the right column used as merge keys.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` method needs to properly handle timezone-aware datetime objects and ensure that the data types of the merge keys are compatible for the merge operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    left_index = self.left.index
    right_column = self.right[self.right_on[0]]  # Assuming there's only one column in right_on

    # Convert timezone-aware index to UTC if needed
    if left_index.tzinfo is not None and left_index.tzinfo != pytz.utc:
        left_index = left_index.tz_convert('UTC')

    # Convert timezone-aware column to UTC if needed
    if right_column.dtype.tz is not None and right_column.dtype.tz != pytz.utc:
        right_column = right_column.dt.tz_localize(right_column.dtype.tz).dt.tz_convert('UTC')

    left_keys.append(left_index)
    right_keys.append(right_column)

    join_names.append(self.right_on[0])

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we handle the timezone-aware datetime objects properly by converting them to UTC if needed. This ensures that the data types of the merge keys are compatible and the merge operation should work as expected.
