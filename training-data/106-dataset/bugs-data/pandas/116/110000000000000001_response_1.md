Potential error location: The error is likely to occur in the section of the code where the `left_keys` and `right_keys` lists are being populated based on the conditions specified in the function.

Reason for the bug: The bug could occur due to incorrect handling of the left and right keys based on the conditions specified in the code. There might be issues with populating the `left_keys` and `right_keys`, as well as the `join_names` lists based on the conditions.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the conditions for populating `left_keys` and `right_keys` based on the left and right keys provided.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    left_keys = []
    right_keys = []
    join_names = []
    right_drop = []
    left_drop = []

    left, right = self.left, self.right

    for lk, rk in zip(self.left_on, self.right_on):
        if is_lkey(lk):
            left_keys.append(lk)
            if is_rkey(rk):
                right_keys.append(rk)
                join_names.append(None)
            else:
                if rk is not None:
                    right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
                    join_names.append(rk)
                else:
                    right_keys.append(right.index)
                    join_names.append(right.index.name)
        else:
            if rk is not None:
                right_keys.append(right._get_label_or_level_values(rk))
            else:
                right_keys.append(right.index)
            if lk is not None and lk == rk:
                if len(left) > 0:
                    right_drop.append(rk)
                else:
                    left_drop.append(lk)
        if lk is not None:
            left_keys.append(left._get_label_or_level_values(lk))
            join_names.append(lk)
        else:
            left_keys.append(left.index)
            join_names.append(left.index.name)

    if left_drop:
        self.left = self.left._drop_labels_or_levels(left_drop)
    if right_drop:
        self.right = self.right._drop_labels_or_levels(right_drop)

    return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
