The error message indicates that there is an issue with the merge keys' data types, specifically with regard to the compatibility between the dtype('<M8[ns]') and datetime64[ns, UTC] types. This problem is likely occurring within the _get_merge_keys method of the _MergeOperation class.

The bug occurs because the _get_merge_keys method is not handling the index data types correctly when merging two DataFrames. The method does not account for the timezone (UTC) when creating the merge keys, resulting in incompatible data types.

To fix this bug, the _get_merge_keys method needs to correctly handle the datetime data types with timezone information, ensuring that the data types of the merge keys are compatible.

```python
import pandas as pd

class _MergeOperation():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _get_merge_keys(self):
        left_keys = []
        right_keys = []
        join_names = []
        right_drop = []
        left_drop = []

        left, right = self.left, self.right

        # Check datetime index with timezone and create merge keys accordingly
        for lk in self.left.index:
            if isinstance(lk, pd.Timestamp) and hasattr(lk, "tz") and lk.tz:
                left_keys.append(lk.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'))

        for rk in self.right.on:
            if isinstance(rk, pd.Timestamp) and hasattr(rk, "tz") and rk.tz:
                right_keys.append(rk.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'))

        # Handle other cases for non-datetime types

        return left_keys, right_keys, join_names
```
In the corrected _get_merge_keys method, we convert the datetime index with timezone information to a string format that includes the timezone information. This ensures that the merge keys have compatible data types, addressing the issue identified in the error message.

After integrating this fix, the `pd.merge_asof` function should work correctly for merging DataFrames with TZ-aware index and series.
