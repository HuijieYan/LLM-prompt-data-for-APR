The problem appears to be with the `_try_convert_to_date` function, specifically with the data type conversion and parsing logic.

The error occurs when trying to convert a bool array into a datetime object, resulting in a TypeError. This is likely due to an incorrect data type conversion within the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the data type conversion logic for boolean arrays, and ensure that the function returns the expected output format, which is a Series of boolean values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(data)
        return new_data, True
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected function, we are using `pd.to_datetime` to directly convert the input data to a datetime object, and returning the result along with a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful or not.

This should fix the problem with converting bool arrays to datetime objects and ensure that the function returns the expected output format.
