The issue appears to be related to the incorrect parsing of boolean values as timestamps using the `pd.read_json` function with `typ="series"`. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to be attempting to parse the data into a date column, which is not the expected behavior when parsing boolean values.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly attempts to coerce boolean values into date formats. This is evident from the fact that in both the provided test cases, the input `data` is a boolean series, and the function is incorrectly attempting to convert it into a date format. This is likely due to a misinterpretation of the data type within the function.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the data type of the input `data` and only proceed with date conversion if the data type is compatible with date formats. In the provided test cases, since the input data is of type `RangeIndex` and `bool` respectively, the function should return the input data as is without attempting any date conversion.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
                return new_data, True
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the input data based on its data type and not attempt any unnecessary date conversions. This should resolve the issue related to incorrect parsing of boolean values as timestamps.
