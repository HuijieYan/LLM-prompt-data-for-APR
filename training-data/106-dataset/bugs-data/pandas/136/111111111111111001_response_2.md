The error "MergeError: key must be integer, timestamp or float" is occurring due to the datatype comparison logic in the `_get_merge_keys` function. The function is incorrectly checking for the datatype of tolerance and index keys, which is resulting in the error.

The bug occurs because the function is performing incorrect datatypes comparison and validation for the tolerance value and the join keys.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the datatype validation for tolerance and index keys.
2. Ensure that tolerance and index keys are properly validated based on their expected datatypes (integer, timestamp, or float).
3. Refactor the logic to use appropriate methods from pandas to perform datatype validation.
4. Ensure that the error messages clearly communicate the reason for the datatype validation failure.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # Your updated logic for validating tolerance and index keys
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(lk.dtype):
            if self.tolerance is not None and not is_numeric(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be numeric for datetime or timedelta index")
        elif is_numeric_dtype(lk.dtype):
            if self.tolerance is not None and not is_numeric(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be numeric for numeric index")
        else:
            raise MergeError("index key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

It is essential to make adjustments according to the specific validation needed for the tolerance and index keys within the `_get_merge_keys` function.
