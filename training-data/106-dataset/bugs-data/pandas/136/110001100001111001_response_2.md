The error in the provided code is that the function `_get_merge_keys` is not properly handling various data types for the join keys and tolerance. The cases are not handled correctly and result in incompatible type errors.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the function to properly handle different data types and resolve the compatibility issues. We need to make sure that the tolerance and join keys have the same data type for comparison.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if self.tolerance is not None:
        lt = self.left.index if self.left_index else left_join_keys[-1]

        if lt.dtype != type(self.tolerance):
            raise MergeError("incompatible tolerance {}, must be compatible with type {}".format(type(self.tolerance), lt.dtype))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
