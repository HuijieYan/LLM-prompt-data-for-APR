This issue is related to the `pd.merge_asof` function, which throws a `MergeError` stating that "key must be integer, timestamp, or float" when trying to merge two DataFrames on an integer key with a specified tolerance.

The code provided is trying to merge `left` and `right` DataFrames on the `a` column with a tolerance of 10.

The error message indicates that the key used for merging must be of type `integer`, `timestamp`, or `float`.

Upon reviewing the code, the issue seems to be arising from the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `pd.merge_asof` function. This method is performing checks that, if the key is of int64 type, only then it's allowing the merge operation, which is not documented behavior.

To address this issue, the `_get_merge_keys` method should be modified to handle integer types other than int64 for the merge operation.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        # perform tolerance check for all integer types
        if is_integer_dtype(lt):
            if not is_integer(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be an integer")
            if self.tolerance < 0:
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the check for int64 type and added a generic tolerance check for all integer types. This should allow the merge operation to be performed on all integer types.

This should resolve the issue where the `pd.merge_asof` function required a specific int type without reflecting it in the error or documentation.
