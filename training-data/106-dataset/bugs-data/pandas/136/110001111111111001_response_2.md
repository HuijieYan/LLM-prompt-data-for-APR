The issue in the code seems to be related to the type of `self.tolerance` and the way it is validated within the `_get_merge_keys` method. The error message indicates that the tolerance must be an integer, timestamp, or float, and the current implementation does not handle this validation correctly.

The potential error location is within the part where tolerance is validated using its type. Depending on the data type of `lt`, different validations should be applied.

The bug occurs because the `self.tolerance` should be validated based on the type of `lt`, but the current implementation only checks for a few specific types. This causes the validation to fail when the tolerance doesn't match the expected types.

To fix this bug, we should update the tolerance validation logic based on the type of `lt` and handle the validation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:

        if self.left_index:
            lt = self.left.index
        else:
            lt = left_join_keys[-1]

        msg = "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat with type {lkdtype}".format(
            tolerance=type(self.tolerance), lkdtype=repr(lt.dtype)
        )

        if is_datetimelike(lt):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, (datetime.timedelta, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise MergeError(msg)
            if (isinstance(self.tolerance, pd.Timedelta) and self.tolerance.to_numpy() < 0) or (isinstance(self.tolerance, datetime.timedelta) and self.tolerance < datetime.timedelta(0)):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

        elif is_integer(lt):
            if not is_integer(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError(msg)
            if self.tolerance < 0:
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

        elif is_float(lt):
            if not is_number(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError(msg)
            if self.tolerance < 0:
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

        else:
            raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # ... (omitted code) ...

```

In this corrected code, the validation of `self.tolerance` has been updated to handle the different cases based on the type of `lt`. The correct checks are performed for datetime.timedelta, Timedelta, integers, and floats, ensuring that the tolerance is validated appropriately for the specific data type.
