The issue with the `_get_merge_keys` function is that it sets the tolerance as an integer and then checks its compatibility with the dtype of the join keys, which are arrays with different numerical types.

The error message "incompatible tolerance <class 'int'>, must be compat with type" suggests that the tolerance is expected to be compatible with the dtype of the join keys.

To fix this issue, the tolerance should be compared with the type of the join keys in a way that ensures compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        # Extract the dtype of the left join keys
        lt_dtype = left_join_keys[-1].dtype
        tolerance_type = type(self.tolerance)

        if tolerance_type == lt_dtype.type:
            # Tolerance type matches the dtype type
            pass
        elif tolerance_type == int and np.issubdtype(lt_dtype, np.integer):
            # Tolerance type is int and dtype is integer
            pass
        else:
            raise MergeError(f"incompatible tolerance {self.tolerance}, must be compatible with type {lt_dtype}")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
