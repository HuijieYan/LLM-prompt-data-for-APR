The bug occurs when the function is validating the tolerance. It checks whether the tolerance is compatible with the type of the index `lt`. If the type is `int64`, it raises an error. However, the input parameter `tolerance` is an integer, and it is not necessary to compare it with the index type.

To fix this bug, we can remove the portion of the code that validates the tolerance. This can be done by eliminating the code that references `self.tolerance` and `lt.dtype`. As a result, the function will not raise an error related to tolerance and type compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
