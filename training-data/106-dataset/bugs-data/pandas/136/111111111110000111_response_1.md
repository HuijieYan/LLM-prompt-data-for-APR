The error occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` function, specifically in the part where it checks for the data type of the join keys. The error message "key must be integer, timestamp or float" is misleading as the join keys are indeed integers but the function incorrectly expects them to be of type int64.

The bug occurs because the code uses the `is_int64_dtype` function to check for the integer type. This restricts the allowable integer types to int64 only.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the code to allow for all integer types as join keys, not just int64. This can be achieved by using a more generic check for integer types, instead of specifically checking for int64. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:

        if self.left_index:
            lt = self.left.index
        else:
            lt = left_join_keys[-1]

        msg = (
            "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat "
            "with type {lkdtype}".format(
                tolerance=type(self.tolerance), lkdtype=repr(lt.dtype)
            )
        )

        if is_datetimelike(lt) or lt.kind == 'i':
            if not (isinstance(self.tolerance, datetime.timedelta) or isinstance(self.tolerance, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise MergeError(msg)
            if self.tolerance < pd.Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

        else:
            raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

The corrected code now uses `lt.kind` to check if the join keys are of integer type, and allows for all types of integers to be used as join keys. Additionally, it checks for `pd.Timedelta` as an alternative to `datetime.timedelta` for the tolerance check.
