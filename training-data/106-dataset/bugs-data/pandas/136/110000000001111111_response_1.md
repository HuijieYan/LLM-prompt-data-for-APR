The bug occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class in the pandas library. The method is responsible for determining the keys to use for merging two DataFrames.

The error message "key must be integer, timestamp or float" is misleading because it suggests that the integer type used for merging is not valid, even though it should be valid.

The bug occurs because the method checks if the type of the key is `int64`, and if it's not, it raises an error. This check is overly restrictive because it should allow for merging on keys of any integer type.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to allow merging on keys of any integer type, not just `int64`. This will involve removing the checks for specific integer types.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if self.left_index:
            lt = self.left.index
        else:
            lt = left_join_keys[-1]

        msg = (
            "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat "
            "with type {lkdtype}".format(
                tolerance=type(self.tolerance), lkdtype=repr(lt.dtype)
            )
        )

        if not isinstance(self.tolerance, type(lt.dtype.type(0))):
            raise MergeError(msg)
        if self.tolerance < 0:
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
This corrected method removes the checks for specific integer types, allowing merging on keys of any integer type. This should resolve the issue and make the error message more accurate.
