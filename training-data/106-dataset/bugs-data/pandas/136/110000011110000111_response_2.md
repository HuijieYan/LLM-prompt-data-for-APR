Based on the error messages and the test case provided, the issue seems to be related to the merge_asof() function in pandas. The error message "key must be integer, timestamp, or float" is being raised even when the data used to merge on is a valid integer type. This is unexpected, and the expected behavior is for the merge to work with all types of integers.

The potential location of the error can be identified in the function _get_merge_keys(self) within the merge_asof() method of pandas/core/reshape/merge.py.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the function performs a check using is_int64_dtype(lt), which will return False for every type of int that isn't int64. This check causes the merge to fail for integer types other than int64.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the check in the _get_merge_keys(self) function to allow for all types of integers, not just int64. This means that the function should accept integers of all sizes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance; datetime.timedelta or Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if self.left_index:
            lt = self.left.index
        else:
            lt = left_join_keys[-1]
        
        if not is_integer(lt):
            raise MergeError("key must be integer")
        
        if self.tolerance < 0:
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle all types of integers as merge keys, addressing the issue raised in the bug report.
