The error occurs in the `_get_merge_keys` function in the `_AsOfMerge` class. The error message "key must be integer, timestamp or float" suggests that there is an issue with the tolerance or the types of columns involved in the merge.

The bug occurs because the tolerance for merging is an `int`, and it is being compared with the type of columns involved in the merge. As a result, when the tolerance is an integer and the column types are numeric, it throws an error.

To fix this, the tolerance needs to be appropriately compared with the types of columns involved in the merge, and if they are compatible, the merge can proceed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # Check if tolerance is applicable
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        # Check if the tolerance type is compatible with the column types
        if not self._is_tolerance_compatible(left_join_keys, right_join_keys, self.tolerance):
            raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # ... omitted code ...

def _is_tolerance_compatible(self, left_join_keys, right_join_keys, tolerance):
    # Determine if the tolerance is compatible with the column types
    valid_column_types = [np.integer, np.floating, np.datetime64]
    column_types = [type(left_join_keys[0][0]), type(right_join_keys[0][0]), type(tolerance)]
    return all(col_type in valid_column_types for col_type in column_types)
```

In this corrected code, a new method `_is_tolerance_compatible` is introduced to check if the tolerance is compatible with the column types involved in the merge. If it's not compatible, the function raises a `MergeError`.
