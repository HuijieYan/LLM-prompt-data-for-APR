The error occurs due to a check in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `AsOfMerge` class. This method is responsible for validating merge keys, tolerance, and index types.

The bug occurs because the method doesn't handle the case when the tolerance is an integer type properly. It raises a `MergeError` stating that the tolerance must be an integer, timestamp, or float, but in reality, the `tolerance` variable is an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the method to handle integer tolerance properly. We need to check whether the type of `tolerance` is integer and implement the validation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    if self.tolerance is not None and not (
        is_integer(self.tolerance)
        or is_float_dtype(self.tolerance)
        or is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(self.tolerance)
    ):
        raise MergeError("tolerance must be integer, float, timestamp, or timedelta")

    if self.left_index:
        # Validate left_index type compatibility
        lt = self.left.index
    else:
        lt = left_join_keys[-1]

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for the type of `tolerance` and appropriately raised a `MergeError` if it's not of the expected types. The other parts of the method remain unchanged.
