The issue description is:

```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
# Your code here
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = pd.Series([datetime.now()])
    with pd.option_context('use_inf_as_na', True):
        s.count()
Problem description
Previously with pandas v0.24.1, the above code works well,
however, after I upgrade the version to v0.25.3,
the above code raises an exception:
AttributeError: 'DatetimeArray' object has no attribute '_constructor'

It seems that something goes wrong when passing a DatetimeArray to _isna_old.
I think it is a bug introduced in some recent update.
