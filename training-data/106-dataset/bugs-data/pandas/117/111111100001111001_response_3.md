The bug seems to be located in the `_isna_old` function. It appears that the function is attempting to identify missing values, but due to some condition checks and unsupported data types, it fails to execute properly.

The bug likely occurs because the function does not handle the DatetimeArray type correctly. The function seems to handle various data types and classes, but it lacks specific handling for DatetimeArray.

To fix the bug, we should add support for the DatetimeArray type within the function. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to handle DatetimeArray instances appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _isna_old(obj):
    """
    Detect missing values, treating None, NaN, INF, -INF as null.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray or object value

    Returns
    -------
    boolean ndarray or boolean
    """
    if is_scalar(obj):
        return libmissing.checknull_old(obj)
    # hack (for now) because MI registers as ndarray
    elif isinstance(obj, ABCMultiIndex):
        raise NotImplementedError("isna is not defined for MultiIndex")
    elif isinstance(obj, type):
        return False
    elif isinstance(obj, (ABCSeries, np.ndarray, ABCIndexClass, DatetimeArray)):  # Add support for DatetimeArray
        return _isna_ndarraylike_old(obj)
    elif isinstance(obj, ABCGeneric):
        return obj._constructor(obj._data.isna(func=_isna_old))
    elif isinstance(obj, list):
        return _isna_ndarraylike_old(np.asarray(obj, dtype=object))
    elif hasattr(obj, "__array__"):
        return _isna_ndarraylike_old(np.asarray(obj))
    else:
        return obj is None
```

In this corrected code, we added `DatetimeArray` as one of the supported types. Now, the function should be able to handle DatetimeArray instances correctly.
