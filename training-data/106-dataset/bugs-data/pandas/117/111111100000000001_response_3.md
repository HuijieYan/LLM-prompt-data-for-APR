Potential Error: The function appears to be attempting to handle missing values such as None, NaN, INF, and -INF, but there are issues with the implementation and potential type errors.

Reason for Bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of object types and potential type errors within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for None, NaN, INF, and -INF explicitly and return the appropriate boolean value.
2. Handle different types of input objects consistently and appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _isna_old(obj):
    """
    Detect missing values, treating None, NaN, INF, -INF as null.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: ndarray or object value

    Returns
    -------
    boolean
    """
    if pd.isna(obj) or obj == np.inf or obj == -np.inf:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
