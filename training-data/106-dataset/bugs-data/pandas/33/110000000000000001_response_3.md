Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line "data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1" where the intention is to replace the masked values with the minimum value in the array minus 1.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is attempting to modify the array "data" by replacing the masked values with the minimum value minus 1, but it is not clear what the "_mask" attribute represents or if it is correctly implemented.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the "_mask" attribute is correctly implemented and represents the indexes of the masked values.
2. Ensure that the minimum value is not being used as a placeholder for masked values.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
