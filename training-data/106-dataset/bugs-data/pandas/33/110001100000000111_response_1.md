Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_values_for_argsort` function, as it is performing operations on the data related to integer arrays.

Reasons for the bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty integer arrays. The function `_values_for_argsort` is copying the data and then modifying it in a way that may lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with empty arrays.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We need to handle the edge case of empty arrays in a way that prevents errors and produces the expected behavior for the sorting operation.

```python
# Corrected function
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
