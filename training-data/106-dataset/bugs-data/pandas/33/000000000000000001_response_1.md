Potential Error:
The function is attempting to modify the 'data' array by setting values at the indices specified by 'self._mask' to the minimum value in the array minus 1. However, there is a possibility that 'self._mask' is not within the bounds of the 'data' array, leading to an error.

Reason for the Bug:
The error occurs because the function does not check whether 'self._mask' is within the bounds of the 'data' array before attempting to modify it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the indices specified by 'self._mask' to ensure they are within the bounds of the 'data' array before attempting to modify the array.
2. Use try-except blocks to handle any index-out-of-bounds errors that might occur.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if len(self._mask) > 0:
        mask_indices = np.where(self._mask)[0]
        mask_indices = mask_indices[mask_indices < len(data)]  # Ensure indices are within bounds
        if len(mask_indices) > 0:
            data[mask_indices] = data.min() - 1
    
    return data
```
