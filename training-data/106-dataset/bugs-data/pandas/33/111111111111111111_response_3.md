The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` function within the `IntegerArray` class. The function tries to set the minimum value of the data array to be `data.min() - 1` where `data` is an empty array. This results in a `ValueError` with the message "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity".

The reason behind this bug is that when the data array is empty, calling `min()` on it results in a `ValueError` because there is no minimum value in an empty array. The subsequent operation of setting the minimum value of the array to `data.min() - 1` then triggers the error.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the data array is empty. If it is, we can return an empty array without performing any operations. This will prevent the `ValueError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the data array is empty. If it is, the function will return the empty array without performing any operations, thus preventing the `ValueError` from occurring.
