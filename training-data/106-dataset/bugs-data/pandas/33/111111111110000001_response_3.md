The error message indicates a ValueError: "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity." This error occurs when trying to take the minimum of an empty array, which is not defined.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. Here, the code attempts to calculate the minimum value of `data` and subtracts 1 from it, which would give an invalid result if `data` is empty.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_values_for_argsort` function to check if the `data` array is empty before performing any operations on it. If the array is empty, we can return an empty array or handle it in an appropriate way.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
