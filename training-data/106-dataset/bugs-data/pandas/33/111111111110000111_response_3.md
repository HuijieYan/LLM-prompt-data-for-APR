The test case 'test_value_counts_empty' tries to create a Series with an empty array and a dtype of 'Int64' and then calls the 'value_counts' method on it. The error message indicates that the error occurs in the 'value_counts' method while trying to sort the empty array, leading to a ValueError due to a zero-size array to the reduction operation minimum which has no identity.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the '_values_for_argsort' method of the 'IntegerArray' class. The line 'data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1' tries to modify the 'data' array using the mask, but the issue arises when the 'data' array is empty.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the 'data' array is empty, calling 'data.min()' results in a ValueError due to a zero-size array to the reduction operation minimum which has no identity.

To fix the bug, we can handle the case when the 'data' array is empty by adding a condition to check for it and returning an empty array in such cases. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring when trying to access the minimum value of an empty array.

The corrected code for the '_values_for_argsort' method is as follows:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
