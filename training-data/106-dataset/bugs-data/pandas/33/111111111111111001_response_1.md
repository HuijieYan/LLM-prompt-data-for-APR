The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to a reduction operation minimum on a zero-size array. The error is most likely caused by attempting to find the minimum value of an empty array.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the array is empty before attempting to find the minimum value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

By adding a check for the length of the data array, we ensure that we don't perform the minimum value operation on an empty array, which should resolve the `ValueError` reported in the test case.
