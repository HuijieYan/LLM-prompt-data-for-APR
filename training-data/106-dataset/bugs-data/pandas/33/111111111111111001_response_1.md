The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. The error message indicates a "ValueError" with the message "zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity". This error occurs when trying to find the minimum of an empty array, which could be happening inside the `data.min()` call.

The potential error location is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` within the `_values_for_argsort` method.

To fix this bug, first, we need to handle the case when the `data` array is empty. We can add a check to ensure that the array is not empty before attempting to get the minimum value.

Here's the fixed code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(data) > 0:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

In the modified code, we added a check `if len(data) > 0:` to ensure that the `data` array is not empty before assigning the minimum value. If the array is empty, no assignment will be made, avoiding the "ValueError" mentioned in the error message.
