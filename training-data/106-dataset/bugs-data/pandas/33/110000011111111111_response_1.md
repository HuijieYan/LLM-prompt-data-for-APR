The bug is located in the `_values_for_argsort` method. The error message suggests that there is a ValueError due to a zero-size array being used in a reduction operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the input array is empty, the `data.min()` operation returns an error because it is trying to find the minimum value in an empty array, which is not possible.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_values_for_argsort` method to handle the case when the input array is empty by checking if the array is empty before performing the min operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

By adding a check for an empty array before performing the min operation, we can prevent the ValueError from occurring and handle the empty array case gracefully.
