The error is occurring when the `value_counts` method is called on an empty series, and it tries to sort the values using the `argsort` method. This `argsort` method is calling the `_values_for_argsort` method on an empty array, leading to the `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`.

The potential error location within the `_values_for_argsort` method is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. When the array `data` is empty, calling `data.min()` on an empty array results in the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if the array is empty, and if so, return the array as it is. Otherwise, perform the transformation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if len(data) == 0:  # check if the array is empty
        return data
    else:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With this modification, the function first checks if the array is empty, and if so, returns the array as it is without performing any transformation. This should resolve the issue when calling `value_counts` on an empty series.
