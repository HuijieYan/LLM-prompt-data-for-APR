The error message indicates that there is a "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity" occurring in the `_amin` function from the numpy library when the `data.min()` is called in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the buggy function.

The error occurs because when `data` is an empty array, calling `data.min()` will result in a ValueError because there is no minimum value to calculate in an empty array.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if the `data` array is empty before trying to find its minimum value. If it is empty, we can return an empty array directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    else:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```
