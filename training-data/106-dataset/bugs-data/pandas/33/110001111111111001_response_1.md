The error occurs during the execution of the test `test_value_counts_empty`, specifically when calling the `value_counts` method on the empty Series `s`. The error message indicates a ValueError related to a reduction operation minimum on a zero-size array.

The potential error location within the `_values_for_argsort` method is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`, where `data` is an empty array and `self._mask` is also an empty array.

The reason for the bug is that when `data` is an empty array and `self._mask` is also an empty array, the operation `data.min()` results in a ValueError because there is no minimum value in an empty array.

To fix the bug, a check can be added to ensure that there are elements in the array before trying to find the minimum value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
