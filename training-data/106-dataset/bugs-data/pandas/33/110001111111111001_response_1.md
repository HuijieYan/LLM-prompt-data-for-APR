The error message indicates that there is a "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity" occurring in the `_values_for_argsort` method within the `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` file. This method is called from the `argsort` method in the `pandas/core/arrays/base.py` file, which in turn is called from the `sort_values` method in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The error is triggered when trying to perform the minimum operation on an empty array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. It seems that this line is trying to set the minimum value of the data where the mask is True, but when the array is empty, this operation results in a ValueError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `data` array is empty, and when trying to perform a reduction operation like `data.min()`, it results in a ValueError because there is no identity (or default) value for an empty array.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `data` array is empty and avoid performing operations that rely on reductions (such as `min()`). We can achieve this by adding a check to see if the `data` array is empty, and return an empty array in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:  # Check if the data array is empty
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)  # Return an empty array with the same dtype
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

With this modification, the function will return an empty array with the same dtype as `self._data` when the `self._data` array is empty, effectively handling the zero-size array case and preventing the ValueError from occurring.
