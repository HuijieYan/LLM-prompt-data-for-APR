The error occurs at the point where the `data` array is modified in the `_values_for_argsort` method. The error message suggests that the minimum operation is being performed on an empty array, which is causing a ValueError.

The reason for this error is that when the `_values_for_argsort` method is called with an empty array and mask, the minimum value of the `data` array becomes -1, which causes issues during the sorting operation.

To fix this issue, we can check if the `data` array is empty before attempting to modify it. If it is empty, we can return an empty array without any modifications. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:  # Check if the array is empty
        return self._data  # Return the empty array without modifications

    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```
