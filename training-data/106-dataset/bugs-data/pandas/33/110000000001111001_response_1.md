The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to use the copy method on a custom class (self._data) which doesn't have a copy method. This can cause an AttributeError.

The buggy function is trying to make a copy of the data and then replace some elements based on a mask. However, the data is not a numpy array, so the copy method cannot be used in this context.

To fix this bug, we can first convert self._data and self._mask into numpy arrays before performing the operations. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = np.array(self._data)
    mask = np.array(self._mask)
    data[mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By converting self._data and self._mask into numpy arrays before using them, we ensure that the operations performed on them are valid and the function should work as intended.
