The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the input arrays are empty. When the input arrays are empty, the function does not return the expected result.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for the edge case where the input arrays are empty. This results in the function returning an array with no elements, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the input arrays are empty. If the input arrays are empty, we can return an empty array as the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```
