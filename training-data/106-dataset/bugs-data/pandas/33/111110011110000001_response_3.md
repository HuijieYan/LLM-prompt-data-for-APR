The error message is a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`. This error occurs when trying to find the minimum value of an empty array, which does not have a valid minimum value.

The potential error location within the `_values_for_argsort` function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line is trying to replace the missing values marked by the mask with an arbitrary value (`data.min() - 1`), assuming that the minimum value exists. 

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the `data` array is empty before using `data.min()`. If it is empty, we should handle this case separately to avoid the `ValueError`.

The corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function is as follows:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
