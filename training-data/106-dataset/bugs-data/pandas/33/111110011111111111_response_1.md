The error occurs in the function `_values_for_argsort` in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. 
The reason for the error is that when `self._mask` is an empty array, the `data[self._mask]` tries to perform an operation on an empty array, which leads to the ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the mask is non-empty before performing the operation. If the mask is non-empty, then the operation should be performed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
