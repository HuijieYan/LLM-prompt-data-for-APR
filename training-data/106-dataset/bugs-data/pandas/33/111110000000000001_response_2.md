Potential error location: 
The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is likely causing the bug. It appears that the intention is to replace the masked values in `data` with a placeholder value, but the current implementation is using `data.min() - 1` as the placeholder value.

Reason for the bug: 
Using `data.min() - 1` as the placeholder value may not be appropriate because it assumes that all the values in the array are positive. If the array contains negative values, this approach would not work correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Find the actual minimum value in `data` and use it as the placeholder value for masked values.
2. Use a large negative value as the placeholder value if `data` contains both positive and negative values.

Corrected code:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
