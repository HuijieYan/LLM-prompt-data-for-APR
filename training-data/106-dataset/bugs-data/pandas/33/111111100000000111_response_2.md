The issue stems from the `_values_for_argsort` function within the `IntegerArray` class. The function is attempting to transform the values for sorting, but there is an error in the way it handles the mask and data arrays.

The error occurs because the function tries to modify the `data` array based on the `_mask` array, but the operation `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` can lead to issues when the `_mask` array is empty or when it doesn't cover all the elements of the `data` array.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `_mask` array is empty or doesn't cover all elements of the `data` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if np.any(self._mask):
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

In the corrected code, we added a check `if np.any(self._mask):` to ensure that the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` operation is only performed if the `_mask` array contains some True values. This prevents the error that occurs when the `_mask` array is empty or doesn't cover all elements of the `data` array.
