The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `value_counts` method when called on a zero-size array with dtype "Int64". The bug seems to be present in the `_values_for_argsort` method, which is likely causing the ValueError when trying to perform minimum operation on an empty array.

It is likely that the issue is caused by the manipulation of values within the array `data` in the `_values_for_argsort` method. Specifically, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` seems to be problematic, as it is attempting to calculate the minimum value of an empty array.

To fix this bug, the `_values_for_argsort` method should be modified to handle the case of empty arrays appropriately. One possible approach would be to add a check for empty arrays in the `_values_for_argsort` method and return an empty array if the input array is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(data) == 0:
        return np.array([])
    else:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

By adding a check for empty arrays, the corrected method ensures that the minimum operation is not performed on an empty array, which should resolve the ValueError that was being encountered.
