1. The test case provided is attempting to use the value_counts function on an empty Series with dtype 'Int64'.

2. The potential error location within the code is the use of data.min() - 1, which could potentially cause issues with the 'Int64' data type.

3. The error occurs because the code is using the .min() method on an empty array, which returns NaN. Subsequently subtracting 1 from NaN results in NaN, which is incompatible with 'Int64' dtype.

4. To fix the bug, we can update the code to handle the case of an empty data array, and explicitly set the minimum value to a suitable default before using it to update the 'mask' values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if data.size > 0:
        min_val = data.min()
        data[self._mask] = min_val - 1
    else:
        data = np.array([])  # Handle the case of empty data array
    
    return data
```
