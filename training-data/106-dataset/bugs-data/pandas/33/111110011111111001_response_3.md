The error message is indicating a ValueError caused by a reduction operation on a zero-size array. This operation is likely caused by the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` inside the `_values_for_argsort` method.

The bug occurs because the `data` array is empty, and when trying to perform a reduction operation (`min()`), it results in a ValueError due to the zero-size array.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to check if the `data` array is empty before performing the `data.min()` operation. If the array is empty, we can handle it or return an empty array based on the specific use case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
