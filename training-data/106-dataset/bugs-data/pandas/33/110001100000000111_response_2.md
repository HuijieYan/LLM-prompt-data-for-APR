Potential Error:
The error is occurring because the `data` array is empty, and when trying to perform an operation on it, it's causing a ValueError.

Reasons for the Bug:
The current function does not handle the case where the input `data` array is empty. When the input array is empty, the code tries to perform an operation on it without checking for this condition, leading to the ValueError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty array if the input `data` is empty.
2. Handle the case where the input `data` array is empty by adding logic to control the flow of the function based on the size of the input data.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(data) == 0:  # Check for empty array
        return data  # Return empty array
    else:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

By adding a check for an empty array at the beginning of the function, we can prevent the operation from being performed on an empty array and avoid the ValueError.
