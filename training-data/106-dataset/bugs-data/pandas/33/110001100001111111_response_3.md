Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` line of the `_values_for_argsort` function. It seems that the function is trying to change the values of `data` based on the values of `self._mask`, which might be causing the error.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles zero-size arrays, specifically in the context of the `Int64` data type. When the input array is empty, the function attempts to modify the values of the array based on the mask, which leads to a ValueError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One approach to fix this bug is to add a condition to check if the input array is empty, and if so, return an empty array without any modifications. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring when the input array is of zero size.

Another approach could be to handle the empty array case by returning a default value or handling it in a way that is appropriate for the context of the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
