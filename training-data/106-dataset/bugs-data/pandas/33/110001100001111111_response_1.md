Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `value_counts` method when a zero-size Int64 array is passed.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function `_values_for_argsort` is supposed to return values for sorting, but it appears that it is modifying the input data in a way that causes an error when used in the `value_counts` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid modifying the input data in the `_values_for_argsort` function.
2. Ensure that the function returns the input data in a format that is compatible with other methods like `value_counts`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
