The issue seems to be related to the `value_counts` function for the `Int64` type. The `value_counts` function is likely related to the `_values_for_argsort` method, where the bug is located. The bug occurs because the method is trying to perform an operation on a zero-size array, causing a ValueError when used with the `value_counts` function.

To fix this bug, you can add a condition to check for an empty array before performing the operation that causes the error. If the array is empty, you can simply return an empty array to avoid the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method with the fix:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=int)
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

With this fix, the method will first check if the data array is empty, and if it is, it will return an empty array to avoid the ValueError when used with `value_counts` function.
