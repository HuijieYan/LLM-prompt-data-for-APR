The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` function of the `IntegerArray` class, particularly at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`.

The issue is caused by trying to calculate the minimum value of an empty array, which results in a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`.

To fix this bug, we need to check for empty arrays and handle them accordingly in the `_values_for_argsort` function. We can modify the function to first check if the data array is empty and return an empty array if it is, to avoid the `ValueError`.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    if data.size > 0:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding the check for empty arrays, we ensure that the minimum value calculation is performed only when the array is non-empty, thereby addressing the `ValueError` issue.
