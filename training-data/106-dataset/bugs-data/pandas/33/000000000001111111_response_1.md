The error occurs because when the input data is an empty array, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` tries to access the minimum value of an empty array, which leads to the "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction" error.

To fix this bug, you can add a condition to check if the data array is empty before attempting to perform any operations on it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if len(data) > 0:  # Check if data array is not empty
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    
    return data
```

This fix ensures that the statement `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is only executed if the data array is not empty, preventing the error from occurring.
