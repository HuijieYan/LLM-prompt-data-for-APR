Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` in the `_values_for_argsort` function. Since the `self._mask` is an empty boolean array, trying to subset `data` using this mask is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because when `self._mask` is an empty boolean array, there are no elements to replace with `data.min() - 1`. Therefore, performing the operation `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` on an empty array raises a ValueError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
A possible solution would be to check if the `self._mask` array is empty before attempting to perform the operation. If the mask is empty, the function should return the original `data` array without any modifications.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._mask) == 0:
        return self._data
    else:
        data = self._data.copy()
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `self._mask` array is empty. If it is, we simply return the original `self._data` array. Otherwise, we perform the required operation on the `data` array. This fix ensures that the function returns a valid array in both cases, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
