The buggy function `_values_for_argsort` attempts to return transformed values for sorting by copying the `_data`, setting masked values to a very low value, and then returning the transformed data. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line is causing the issue because it tries to assign a value to `data` using the mask array, which might not align with the shape of `data`.

The bug occurs because it seems that the mask array and the data array might not have the same shape. As a result, the assignment `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` may produce unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we can use boolean indexing to update the values in the `data` array based on the mask. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = np.min(data) - 1
    return data
```

In the corrected code, we use boolean indexing (`data[self._mask]`) to update the values in the `data` array based on the mask, and then return the transformed data. This approach ensures that the shape of the mask and the data array are aligned, and the assignment produces the expected result.
