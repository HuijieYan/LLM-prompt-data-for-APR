The error is occurring in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. The error message indicates a "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity" which implies that the `data.min()` operation is being performed on an empty array.

The bug in the `_values_for_argsort` method is that it does not handle the case when the input data array is empty. This results in an error when trying to calculate the minimum value of an empty array.

To fix this bug, a check should be added to handle the case when the input data array is empty. If the array is empty, the method should return an empty array without performing any operations.

Here's the corrected function for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data  # Return empty array if input data is empty

    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```
