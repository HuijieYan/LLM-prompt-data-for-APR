The buggy function `_values_for_argsort` is trying to return the values for sorting by replacing the masked (missing) values with the minimum value of the data array minus 1. However, the bug in the code is that it does not handle the case when the data array is empty.

Potential error location: 
The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is causing the bug because when `self._data` is empty, the `data.min()` will return an error.

Reason behind the bug:
The buggy function does not handle the case when the data array is empty. When the data array is empty, trying to access the minimum value of the array will result in an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to add a condition to check if the data array is empty and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the data array is empty. If it is, we return an empty array of the same dtype. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic to replace the masked values.
