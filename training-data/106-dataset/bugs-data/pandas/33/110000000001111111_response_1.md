The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line seems to be trying to replace the values in `data` with the minimum value - 1 where `self._mask` is True. However, due to the specific input values provided, this line is causing the issue because the input arrays are empty.

The bug occurs because when the input arrays `self._data` and `self._mask` are empty, the operation `data[self._mask]` will also result in an empty array. As a result, attempting to assign a value to this empty array leads to the error.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the input arrays are not empty before performing the operation that causes the error.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([])
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    if len(self._mask) > 0:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

With this modification, we check if the input array `self._data` is empty. If it is, we return an empty array. Additionally, we only perform the operation `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` if the length of `self._mask` is greater than 0, ensuring that the operation is only performed when the mask array is not empty.
