Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` line in the `_values_for_argsort` method. It looks like the intention is to replace masked values with the minimum value in the array decreased by 1.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty arrays. When the input data is an empty array, the `data.min()` returns `np.inf`, which then leads to the error when trying to subtract 1 from it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the array is empty before trying to perform any operations on it. If it's empty, handle this case separately to avoid the error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
