The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. 

The error likely occurs because `self._mask` is likely an empty boolean array, and using an empty boolean array as a mask to index another array does not work as intended. This can result in unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if `self._mask` is non-empty before applying it as a mask to `data`. Additionally, we can use the `np.where` function to conditionally apply the mask.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        data = np.where(self._mask, data.min() - 1, data)
    return data
```
