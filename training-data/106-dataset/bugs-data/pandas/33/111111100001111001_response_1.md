The buggy function `_values_for_argsort` is supposed to return the values for sorting, but it has a bug in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. The buggy code sets the values at the masked positions to the minimum value in the `data` array minus 1, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to handle the missing values represented by the mask, but it is not handling them properly. Instead of setting the masked values to a specific value, the correct approach should be to sort the non-masked values and maintain the ordering with the masked values.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to sort the non-masked values and leave the masked values unchanged.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = np.nan  # Set the masked values to NaN
    return data
```

In the corrected code, the masked values are set to `np.nan` instead of the minimum value minus 1. This allows the non-masked values to be sorted properly while maintaining the ordering with the masked values.
