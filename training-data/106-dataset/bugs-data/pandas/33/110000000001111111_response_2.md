The issue seems to be related to using an empty or zero-sized Int64 array with the `value_counts` function in pandas. The error message "ValueError: zero-size array to reduction" indicates that there is an attempt to perform a reduction operation on a zero-sized array, which is not allowed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. It seems that the intention of this line is to replace the masked values in the `data` array with a value that is lower than the minimum value of the array.

The bug occurs because when the input array is empty, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` will result in a zero-sized array, and when a reduction operation is performed on this zero-sized array, it raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the case where the input array is empty and avoid performing unnecessary operations that lead to a zero-sized array.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

In the corrected function, we added a check for the length of `self._data`. If the length is 0, we return an empty array with the same dtype as `self._data`. This will prevent the `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` line from causing a zero-sized array when the input is empty, therefore avoiding the ValueError.
