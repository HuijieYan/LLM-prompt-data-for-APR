Potential Error Location:
The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is likely causing the error. It seems to be trying to identify the minimum value in the data array and replace the corresponding masked values with that minimum value minus 1.

Reasons for the Bug:
The buggy code is attempting to modify the 'data' array using a masked array ('self._mask') without properly handling the dimensions or alignment between the two arrays, leading to a potential mismatch error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using direct assignment, use numpy's boolean indexing to modify the 'data' array based on the mask provided by 'self._mask'.
2. Ensure that the dimensions of the 'data' array and the mask align properly to avoid errors related to mismatched shapes.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data[self._mask].min() - 1
    return data
```
In the corrected code, the line `data[self._mask] = data[self._mask].min() - 1` replaces the masked values with the minimum value of the masked values in the 'data' array reduced by 1. This approach ensures correct alignment and dimensionality of the array modifications.
