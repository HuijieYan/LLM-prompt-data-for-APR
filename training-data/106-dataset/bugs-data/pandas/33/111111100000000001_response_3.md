Potential error location: 

The error occurs in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` of the `_values_for_argsort` function. It seems that the intention is to replace the missing values in the `data` array with a value that would not affect sorting, but the current implementation is incorrect.

Reasons behind the bug:

The current implementation of the function is attempting to replace missing values in the `data` array with `data.min() - 1`, assuming that `data.min()` will return the minimum value in the `data` array. However, this assumption may not always be correct, especially if there are missing values (NA) present in the array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use the `np.nanmin` function from NumPy to get the minimum value in the array while ignoring any NA values.
2. Replace the missing values with a value that is outside the range of valid values in the `data` array, ensuring that it would not affect the sorting.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (other code)

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
