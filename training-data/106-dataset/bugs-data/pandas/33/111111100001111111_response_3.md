Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the `_values_for_argsort` function where it is trying to manipulate the `data` array based on the `_mask` values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because when the `_data` array is empty and `_mask` is also empty, the code tries to perform an operation that results in a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction` error. This is because the minimum value of an empty array does not exist, and the code attempts to subtract 1 from it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the `_data` array is empty and handle this edge case separately. If the array is empty, the function should return an empty array without performing any operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
