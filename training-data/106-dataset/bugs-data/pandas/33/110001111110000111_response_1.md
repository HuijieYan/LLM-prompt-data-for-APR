The error message indicates a ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity. This suggests that there is an issue with the minimum operation being performed on an empty array, resulting in this error.

It seems that the issue is occurring in the _values_for_argsort method of the integer.py file. The line data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1 is likely causing the error when the array data is empty.

The bug occurs because when the array is empty, data.min() returns an empty array, and subtracting 1 from an empty array leads to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to handle the case when the array is empty and return an empty array in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the _values_for_argsort method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    See Also
    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

With this check in place, when the array is empty, the method will return an empty array, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
