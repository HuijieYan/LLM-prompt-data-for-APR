The error occurs in the `_values_for_argsort` method of the `IntegerArray` class. The line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is causing the error because it tries to apply the `min` function to an empty array, which results in a `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if the `data` array is empty before attempting to calculate `data.min()`. If it is empty, we can simply return the empty `data` array. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    --------
    ExtensionArray.argsort
    """
    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return self._data
    data = self._data.copy()
    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```

By adding the check for the empty `data` array, we prevent the attempt to calculate the minimum of an empty array, thus avoiding the `ValueError` mentioned in the bug report.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the bug report.
