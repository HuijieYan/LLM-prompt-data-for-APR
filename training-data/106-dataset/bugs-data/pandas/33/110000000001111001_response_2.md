Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. 

Reason for the bug:
The buggy function is trying to modify the `data` array based on the values in the `self._mask` array. However, the data types of the arrays `data` and `self._mask` are not aligned, which can cause issues when attempting to assign values to `data` based on the boolean indexing provided by `self._mask`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data type of `self._mask` is aligned with the data type of `data`, and then perform the boolean indexing.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    return data
