Potential error location: 
The potential error lies in the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` where the intention seems to be setting the values in the `data` array to a lower bound value when the corresponding entry in the `_mask` array is True.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `self._data` and `self._mask` arrays have different lengths, which would lead to a broadcasting error when attempting to perform operations on them together. 
2. It seems like the minimum value in the `data` array is being assigned to all the True entries in the `_mask` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `self._data` and `self._mask` arrays have the same length. If they don't, either resize `self._data` to match the length of `self._mask`, or vice versa.
2. Use boolean indexing to set the values in the `data` array to a lower bound value where the `_mask` is True.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    data[self._mask] = np.min(data[~self._mask]) - 1
    return data
