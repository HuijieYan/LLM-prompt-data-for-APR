The potential error in the function `_values_for_argsort` is the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1`. This line is trying to modify the `data` array using the `_mask` boolean array, which might not have the same length as the `data` array.

The buggy function is trying to replace the missing values in `data` with the minimum value in `data` minus 1. However, since the length of `data` and `_mask` might not match, this operation can lead to unexpected results or errors.

To fix this bug, we can use boolean indexing to only modify the values in `data` where `_mask` is `True`. This will ensure that only the missing values in `data` are replaced with the minimum value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.
