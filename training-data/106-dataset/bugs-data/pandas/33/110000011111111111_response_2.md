The error message indicates that a zero-size array is causing a ValueError during the reduction operation. This happens specifically in the `_values_for_argsort` method, where the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` is likely causing the issue. This is because, if the `self._mask` array is empty (zero-size), it will try to perform a reduction operation on an empty array, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this issue, a check should be added to ensure that the `self._mask` array is not empty before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_values_for_argsort` method:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
        return data
    else:
        return np.array([], dtype=self._data.dtype)
```
