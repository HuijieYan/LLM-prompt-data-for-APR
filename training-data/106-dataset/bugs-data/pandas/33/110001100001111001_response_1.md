Potential error location: The error may be occurring at the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` where it seems like the intention is to replace certain elements in `data` with the minimum value - 1 based on the boolean mask `self._mask`.

Reason for the bug: Without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of this function and the usage of `self._mask`. However, it seems like the intention is to replace certain elements in `data` with a new value based on the mask.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. It seems like the intention is to replace the elements in `data` where `self._mask` is True. We can achieve this using boolean indexing.

2. It's also important to handle the case when `self._data` is empty, to avoid errors related to `data.min()`.

3. It's unclear what the intended behavior is when `self._data` and `self._mask` are both empty, so this may need to be clarified or handled in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    if len(self._data) == 0:
        return np.array([], dtype=int)
    
    data = self._data.copy()
    
    if len(self._mask) > 0:
        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    
    return data
```
