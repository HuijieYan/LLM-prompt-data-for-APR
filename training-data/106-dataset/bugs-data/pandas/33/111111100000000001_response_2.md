The potential error in the `_values_for_argsort` function is that it is trying to modify the data array in place and then return the updated array. 

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to modify the data array in place, which can cause unexpected behavior in the original array. It is better to create a copy of the data array and modify the copy instead.

To fix the bug, we need to create a copy of the data array and then modify the copy without affecting the original data array.

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

    data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
