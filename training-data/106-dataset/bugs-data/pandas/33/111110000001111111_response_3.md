The error is likely occurring because when the `value_counts` method is called on a Series with dtype='Int64' and empty, it tries to perform a reduction operation on a zero-sized array, which leads to a ValueError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_values_for_argsort` method because it is manipulating the data array in a way that may cause unexpected behavior, especially with empty arrays.

The bug occurs because when the `_mask` array is empty, the line `data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1` modifies the empty `data` array, causing unexpected behavior later.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to handle the case when the `_mask` array is empty and avoid modifying the `data` array in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _values_for_argsort(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return values for sorting.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The transformed values should maintain the ordering between values
        within the array.

        data[self._mask] = data.min() - 1
    return data
```
