The error occurs when trying to cast float64 values to int64, which is not possible according to the 'safe' casting rule. The error is raised in the `safe_cast` function while trying to convert a float64 array to an int64 array.

The bug is occurring due to the attempt to convert float values to integer values, which is not a safe operation. The buggy function is attempting to apply the `safe_cast` method to convert float values to integers, which is not feasible.

To fix this issue, the function can be updated to handle both integer and float values, or use a different approach for the data conversion.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        if alt is None:
            agg_blocks, agg_items = self.grouper.aggregate_blocks(data, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            agg_blocks, agg_items = self.grouper.aggregate_blocks(data, alt, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

It's important to note that this correction assumes that the logic of the `grouper.aggregate_blocks()` method is correctly implemented to handle both integer and float values.
