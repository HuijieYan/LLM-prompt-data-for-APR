The bug seems to be related to the `DataFrame` `dtype` used in the example. The code seems well structured and comprehensive, but it seems to cause an error when using the `mean`, `median`, or `std` methods with a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

The issue might be related to how the `DataFrame` `_cython_agg_blocks` method handles various data types, especially the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The error might occur due to a mismatch or misinterpretation of the data types when trying to calculate the mean, median, or standard deviation within the grouping.

To fix the bug, it would be essential to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` method handles nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly when performing aggregation operations such as mean, median, or standard deviation.

Here's a possible approach to fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... omitted code ...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate().convert_to_block_manager()
    # ... omitted code ...
```

In this approach, when retrieving the data to aggregate, we explicitly convert it to a `BlockManager` to ensure that the data type is handled consistently across different operations.

This fix should help resolve the reported issue with aggregating nullable integers using the `mean`, `median`, or `std` methods on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
