The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting array types from `float64` to `int64` in the function `_cython_agg_blocks`. This error occurs when trying to aggregate nullable integer values using functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

The issue occurs because nullable integers are stored as `float64`, and when trying to cast them to `int64` using the `astype` method, it fails because there can be a loss of information when converting floating-point numbers to integers.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integers appropriately. We can check the datatype of the values and cast them to `float64` before performing the aggregation. This way, we avoid the issue of trying to cast `float64` to `int64`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # omitted code...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # check for nullable integers and convert them to float64
    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.dtype == "Int64":
            block = block.astype("float64")
        result = block.agg(how)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # omitted code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly cast nullable integer values to `float64` before performing the aggregation. This approach avoids the issue of trying to cast `float64` to `int64`, thereby fixing the bug.
