The error is occurring due to the casting of float values to integer values, which isn't allowed according to the rule 'safe'. This is happening in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method when the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function tries to cast float values to integers.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle the downcasting of float values to integers differently. The method should be modified to cast float values to integers only if they are equivalent, i.e., the float values must be equivalent to the integers. If they are not equivalent, then the method should handle this situation differently, such as returning an error or explicitly converting the float values to a valid type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.dtype == np.int64 and result.dtype == np.float64:
                raise TypeError("Cannot cast non-equivalent float64 to int64")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            # Existing code...

    # Existing code...
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we are adding a check to ensure that if the original dtype is `np.int64` and the result dtype is `np.float64`, then raise a `TypeError` to indicate that the non-equivalent casting is not allowed. This prevents the problematic casting and addresses the issue.
