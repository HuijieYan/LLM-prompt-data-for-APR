The test case is attempting to test the aggregation functions `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrame with nullable integer data. The error message indicates a type casting issue when attempting to cast float values to integer values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the data type of the values when performing aggregation operations.

The error occurs because the `safe_cast` function is trying to cast float values to integer values, which is not possible without potential data loss.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle nullable integer data and floating-point data separately during aggregation operations, and perform the appropriate type casting when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, considering the handling of nullable integer data and floating-point data separately:

```python
# Updated function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged

    # Check for nullable integer data
    is_nullable_integer = all(isinstance(col, pd.Int64Dtype) for col in data.dtypes)

    if numeric_only and not is_nullable_integer:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=["number"])

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

In this correction, we explicitly handle the nullable integer data separately from other numeric data, ensuring that type casting during aggregation operations does not lead to type conflicts and potential data loss.
