The error is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` datatype. The issue seems to be related to the internal handling of the datatype conversion during the aggregation process.

The error seems related to the casting of array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'. This implies that during the aggregation process, there's an attempt to convert float64 values to int64, which is not allowed due to the nullable integer data type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block where the datatype conversion or casting operation occurs, specifically when handling the result of the aggregation and performing data type checks.

To fix this bug, there are a few potential approaches:
1. Modify the datatype handling logic to handle nullable integer types appropriately during the aggregation process.
2. Add checks to identify the datatype of the values being aggregated and ensure that the appropriate casting rules are applied for nullable integer types.
3. Ensure that the result of the aggregation operation is compatible with nullable integer types to avoid casting errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for idx, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        result = block.values
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype.kind == 'f':
            # Convert float values to float dtype which can handle NaN
            result = result.astype('float')

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(np.array([idx], dtype='int'))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we handle the datatype conversion within the loop by checking if the result is of float type and then converting it to the appropriate float data type that can handle NaN. This ensures that the casting operation aligns with the nullable integer datatype and avoids the TypeError caused by the incompatible casting of float to int in the original code.
