The error occurs when the buggy function tries to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, resulting in a TypeError. The bug is likely caused by the buggy function not handling the nullable integer data type correctly when calculating the mean, median, or variance of each group.

To fix the bug, the function needs to appropriately handle the nullable integer data type by using safe casting to handle non-equivalent float64 to int64 conversions. It should also ensure that the calculations are being performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... (omitting some lines for brevity) ...

    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
        safe_cast(block.values, np.dtype('float64'), copy=False), dtype='Int64')
    # continue with other operations

    # ... (remaining code for the function) ...
```

In the corrected code, `safe_cast` is used to perform the appropriate casting from float64 to Int64 data type. This ensures that non-equivalent values are handled properly, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

After applying the above fix, the function should be able to handle the nullable integer data type correctly when aggregating using mean, median, or variance.

The bug should be resolved with this fix.
