The error is occurring because the mean function does not support nullable integers when applied to a DataFrameGroupBy object. This is likely due to a bug in the way that the mean function handles nullable integers.

To fix the bug, the _cython_agg_blocks function needs to be updated to handle nullable integers correctly when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy object. This may involve checking the dtype of the columns being aggregated and handling nullable integers as a special case.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # If numeric_only is True, get only numeric data
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Other variable initialization
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Loop through the blocks in the data
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Processing for calculating the result based on the how parameter
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # Handling of Nullable integers as a special case 
        if pd.api.types.is_nullable_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = result.astype('Int64')
        
        # Creating the aggregated block and appending to the list
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code for handling results and returning aggregated blocks and items
```

The corrected code handles nullable integers as a special case when calling the mean function within the _cython_agg_blocks function. This should address the TypeError that occurs when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
