The error occurs when calling functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping when using the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The issue does not occur when using the regular `int64` data type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the actual computation of aggregation (mean, median, var) takes place. This error occurs because the floating-point values returned by the `mean` aggregation operation do not match the nullable integer data type, causing a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the nullable integer data type conversion to floating-point values explicitly before performing the aggregation operation.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... omitted code ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    data = data.astype('float64')  # Ensure data is of type float64 for aggregation

    # ... remaining code ...
```

By explicitly converting the `data` to type `float64` before performing the aggregation, this will avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when applying aggregations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on nullable integer data types.
