The error occurs when the `safe_cast` function tries to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. This occurs because the values in the DataFrame have been inferred as 'float64' rather than 'int64'. The error originates in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy object, specifically when it's called with the "mean", "median", or "var" functions. These functions try to convert floating point values to integer values, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the DataFrame should be explicitly cast to the correct dtype at an earlier stage to ensure that the data is treated as integers. This can be done using the `astype()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False).astype(int)  # Explicitly cast to int

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # ... remaining code ...
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By adding the `.astype(int)` to the `data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)`, the bug should be fixed as it ensures the data is treated as integers rather than as floats.
