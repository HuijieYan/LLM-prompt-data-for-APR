The bug seems to be caused by an error in the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the values from float64 to int64, causing a TypeError.

The use of `dtype='Int64'` in the DataFrame creation suggests that the bug may be related to how nullable integer data types are being handled during aggregation operations. It appears that the implementation does not handle nullable integer data types correctly during the `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation operations.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregation operations. This may involve implementing custom logic to handle the conversion and computation of mean, median, and variance operations for nullable integer data types.

Additionally, ensuring that the dtype handling for nullable integer data types is consistent across different aggregation operations should be considered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    # New code to handle nullable integer data types
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if data._is_integer_dtype() and is_extension_array_dtype(data.dtype):
        if how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
            # Perform custom handling for nullable integer data types
            result = _handle_nullable_integer_aggregation(data, how, alt)
            return result

    # ... (remaining code for other data types and operations)
``` 

In the corrected code, we check if the data is of nullable integer type using `data._is_integer_dtype()` and `is_extension_array_dtype(data.dtype)` and then handle the aggregation operations for mean, median, and variance accordingly.

Moreover, since the `_handle_nullable_integer_aggregation` function is a hypothetical function, it will need to be implemented separately to perform the necessary aggregation operations for nullable integer data types.

It is important to note that the `_handle_nullable_integer_aggregation` function needs to ensure that the conversion from float64 to int64 for nullable integer data types is handled appropriately to avoid the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
