The problem is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with the dtype set to Int64. This results in a TypeError. The issue is reproducible with other functions like median and std as well.

The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy object. The issue is most likely due to the handling of the Int64 type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. The method is supposed to handle aggregation of numeric data, but it seems to be failing when the data type is Int64.

To fix the bug, the handling of the Int64 data type needs to be adjusted in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. Specifically, the method should include a check or a conversion step to ensure that the Int64 data type is properly handled during aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... previous code ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Check for Int64 data type and handle it accordingly
    if data.dtypes.eq('Int64').any():
        data = data.astype('float64')  # Convert Int64 to float64 for aggregation

    # ... rest of the code ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the data contains the Int64 data type. If it does, we convert the data to float64 type to ensure proper handling during aggregation operations.

By making this adjustment, the issue with calling aggregation functions on Int64 data type within the DataFrameGroupBy object should be resolved.
