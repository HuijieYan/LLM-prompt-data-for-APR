The potential error in the given code is that the `agg_block` might not be initialized within the loop where it is being used. This could lead to errors when `agg_block` is appended to `agg_blocks` outside the loop.

The potential issue in the code is that the `agg_block` is being used regardless of whether a valid result is obtained or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior and could potentially cause runtime errors.

To fix this issue, we can initialize `agg_block` as `None` before the loop and then assign the result of the aggregation operation to `agg_block` within the loop. Then, we can check if `agg_block` is not `None` before appending it to `agg_blocks`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code ...

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code ...

        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # existing code ...

            if result is not no_result:
                # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    # existing code ...

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # existing code ...

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # existing code ...

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
