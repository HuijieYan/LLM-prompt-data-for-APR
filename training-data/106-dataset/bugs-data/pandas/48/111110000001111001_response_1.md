The potential issue with the _cython_agg_blocks function is that there is no implementation for the function 'self.grouper.aggregate'. This function takes the block values and aggregates them based on the provided parameters. Since 'self.grouper' appears to be a BaseGrouper object, there is likely a method associated with this object that needs to be called instead of calling it directly.

To fix the bug, we need to identify the correct method or function associated with 'self.grouper' to perform the aggregation on the block values.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if how == 'mean':
            result, _ = self.grouper._cython_mean_agg(block.values, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        elif how == 'median':
            result, _ = self.grouper._cython_median_agg(block.values, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        elif how == 'var':
            result, _ = self.grouper._cython_var_agg(block.values, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, I assumed that the BaseGrouper object has specific methods like _cython_mean_agg, _cython_median_agg, and _cython_var_agg to perform the aggregation based on the 'how' parameter provided to the _cython_agg_blocks function. I used these methods to calculate the 'result' values based on different aggregation operations. Make sure to replace these method names with the correct ones present in the BaseGrouper object.
