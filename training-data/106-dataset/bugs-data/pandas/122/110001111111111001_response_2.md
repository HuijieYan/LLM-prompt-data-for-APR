The error occurs because the `equals` method is not comparing the DataFrames correctly. The `equals` method should return True if the two DataFrames have the same shape and elements. In the given testcase, df1 and df2 have different elements, so the assertion fails.

The bug in the implementation of the `equals` method is that it is not handling the comparison of the DataFrames correctly. It is trying to compare the axes, then consolidating the axes and blocks, and finally comparing the blocks using a non-existent `equals` method of the block.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should be modified to compare the DataFrames directly, without involving the `axes` and `blocks`. This can be achieved using the `values` attribute of the DataFrames, which returns a NumPy array representation of the DataFrame data.

The corrected implementation of the `equals` method is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    return (self.index.equals(other.index) and
            self.columns.equals(other.columns) and
            (self.values == other.values).all())
```

This implementation directly compares the index, columns, and values of the DataFrames and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise.

After making this change, the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
