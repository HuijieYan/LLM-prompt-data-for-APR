The potential error in the `equals` method is the missing `self` parameter in the `canonicalize` nested function. This causes a NameError when trying to access attributes of the `self` object within the `canonicalize` function. The error occurs because the `canonicalize` nested function does not have access to the attributes of the `BlockManager` class.

To fix this issue, the `canonicalize` function should be defined as a separate method within the `BlockManager` class so that it has access to the attributes of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return self._blocks_equal(other)

def _blocks_equal(self, other):
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `equals` method now calls a separate `_blocks_equal` method to handle the comparison of the blocks. The `canonicalize` nested function has been converted to an inner function within the `_blocks_equal` method, and it now has access to the attributes of the `BlockManager` class. This resolves the NameError issue and ensures that the comparison of blocks can be performed correctly.
