The error occurs in the `equals` function, specifically in the comparison of blocks. It seems that the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is not properly handling the order of the blocks.

The reason for the bug is that the original code doesn't handle the order of the blocks properly when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. Due to this, identical blocks with different locations are not being compared correctly and leading to a wrong result.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to sort the blocks based on their type name and manager locations to properly canonicalize the order before comparing them. This should ensure that even if block locations are different, the comparison would take into account the actual content of the blocks.

The corrected code for the `equals` function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on type name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the block order is properly canonicalized before the comparison. This should resolve the issue and make sure that the comparison of identical blocks with different locations returns the correct result.
