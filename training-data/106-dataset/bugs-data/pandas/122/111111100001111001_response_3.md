The "canonicalize" function is defined twice inside the "BlockManager" class. The first definition is outside of a function in the class, and the second one is inside the function "equals". This results in the outer "canonicalize" function being shadowed by the inner one, and it's the inner one that is used.

This can lead to unexpected results and possibly incorrect behavior, as the wrong function might be invoked when "canonicalize" is called.

To fix this bug, the inner "canonicalize" function should be given a different name, or the outer one should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the "equals" function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the "canonicalize" function inside "equals" has been renamed to "canonicalize_block" to avoid conflicts with the outer function.
