Potential error location: the function is comparing the consolidated inplace blocks instead of the original ones, which can lead to incorrect comparisons.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The original and consolidated inplace blocks are being compared, but the expected behavior is to compare the original blocks.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix this issue, we should compare the original blocks instead of the consolidated inplace blocks.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self_consolidated = self.copy()
    self_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    other_consolidated = other.copy()
    other_consolidated._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_consolidated.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
