The bug in the given function is due to an AttributeError. The function calls the 'equals' method on the axes, blocks, and block objects. However, based on the provided information, it seems that there is no method called 'equals' for these objects. Therefore, the AttributeError is expected to occur when the function tries to execute these statements.

To fix the bug:
1. The function should compare the axes and blocks directly without relying on the 'equals' method.
2. To compare the 'BlockManager' objects, custom comparison logic should be implemented to compare the internal details of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Custom comparison logic for comparing blocks
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        # Replace the custom comparison logic with the appropriate logic
        if self.blocks[i] != other.blocks[i]:
            return False

    return True
```
