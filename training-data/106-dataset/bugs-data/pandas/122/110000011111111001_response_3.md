The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The test is asserting that the two dataframes are not equal. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, causing the test to fail.

The issue in the `equals` method is likely caused by the comparison of the blocks within the dataframes. The sorting of the blocks and the comparison logic within the `equals` method may be faulty, leading to incorrect comparisons and the method returning `True` instead of `False`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic and the sorting of the blocks need to be corrected. It's important to ensure that the correct order and type of blocks are being compared between the two dataframes.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, I've updated the sorting of the blocks to utilize the block type name and `mgr_locs` as the sorting key. Additionally, the comparison logic between the sorted blocks has been preserved. These changes should ensure that the `equals` method returns the correct result when comparing the two dataframes.
