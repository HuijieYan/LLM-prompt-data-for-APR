## Analysis
The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal()` compares two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, using the `equals` method. The expected outcome is `False`, but it failed due to an assertion error.

## Error Location
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is the likely location of the bug.

## Reasons for Bug
The bug occurs because the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two DataFrames. It fails to check the equality of the contents of the blocks within the DataFrames, resulting in an incorrect return value.

## Possible Approaches
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the contents of the blocks within the DataFrames. The comparison should take into account the order of the blocks, type names, and manager locations.

## Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = [self._xmgr.blocks.get(b.lookup(b.mgr_locs)) for b in self._xmgr.blocks]
    other_blocks = [other._xmgr.blocks.get(b.lookup(b.mgr_locs)) for b in other._xmgr.blocks]
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda b: (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array))
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda b: (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.as_array))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code now correctly compares the contents of the blocks within the DataFrames. This should resolve the issue with the `equals` method incorrectly returning `True`.
