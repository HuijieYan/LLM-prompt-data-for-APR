1. The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False, but it's currently returning True, which is causing the test to fail.

2. The potential error location is within the `equals` method itself, where the comparison of the two DataFrames is taking place. 

3. The bug is occurring because the `equals` method is not correctly handling the comparison of the DataFrames. It seems to be comparing the internal structure of the DataFrames without properly considering the ordering of the columns.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `equals` method to compare the DataFrames based on their column values rather than their internal structures. This could involve iterating through each column and comparing the values directly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if len(self.columns) != len(other.columns):
        return False
    for col1, col2 in zip(self.columns, other.columns):
        if not (self[col1] == other[col2]).all():
            return False
    return True
```

In this corrected code, we are comparing the DataFrames based on their columns and their respective values. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data rather than internal structures or ordering. This should resolve the issue identified in the test case.
