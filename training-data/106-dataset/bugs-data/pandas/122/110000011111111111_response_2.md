The error in the equals method is caused by incorrect comparison of the blocks in the two BlockManagers. The bug causes the method to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` for the test provided.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic used to compare the blocks in the two BlockManagers. We should compare the blocks in a way that takes into account their contents and not just their positions within the BlockManager.

The corrected code for the equals method is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort the blocks before comparing
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
