Potential error location: 
The if statement `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))` is attempting to call the `equals` method on `ax1` and `ax2` objects. However, there's no guarantee that the `equals` method exists for these objects.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the `equals` method exists for `ax1` and `ax2` objects without checking for its existence. This can lead to a AttributeError if the method does not exist for the objects.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can modify the code to use a different method to compare `ax1` and `ax2` objects, such as `==` for comparing equality.

Corrected code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1 == ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
