The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is comparing two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The expected outcome is `False`, indicating that the two dataframes are not equal.

The error message states that the comparison `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` resulted in `assert True is False`, which means that the `equals` method incorrectly returned `True` instead of `False`.

Upon reviewing the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class, the bug seems to be in the conditional logic and the sorting of the blocks for comparison. It also seems that the data types and locations of the blocks are not being handled properly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug in the `equals` method, the comparison logic and block sorting need to be modified. The bug seems to be related to the canonicalization of block order and the comparison between the blocks. Additionally, the handling of data types and locations should be improved for accurate comparison.

Here's the corrected `equals` method with the bug fixed:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on dtype and locations for accurate comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._block_type, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to use the `_block_type` attribute for distinguishing block types. Additionally, the data locations are being used for sorting the blocks.

After applying these fixes, the `equals` method should accurately compare the dataframes `self` and `other`, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
