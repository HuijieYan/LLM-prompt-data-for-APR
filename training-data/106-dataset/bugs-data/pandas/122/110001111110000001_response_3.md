The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `equals` function is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is most likely in the comparison of the blocks between `self` and `other`. The `canonicalize` function may also have a potential issue.

The bug is occurring because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly determining the block order based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. This ultimately leads to the incorrect comparison of the blocks between `self` and `other`.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly determine the block order based on the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block. Additionally, the comparison of the blocks between `self` and `other` should be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple with the block's type name and `mgr_locs` as a tuple. This should correctly determine the block order. Additionally, the comparison of the sorted blocks between `self` and `other` has been fixed for accurate comparison.
