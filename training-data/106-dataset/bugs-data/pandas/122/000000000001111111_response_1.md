The buggy function is the `equals` method, which should compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. However, the current implementation has a few issues. 

Firstly, the method incorrectly compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects before consolidating them. This can lead to false positives if the blocks are identical but located in different positions.

Secondly, the method sorts and compares the blocks based on the block type and their positions, which can also lead to false positives if the blocks are identical but positioned differently.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should compare the blocks directly without sorting or consolidating them. This will ensure that the method correctly checks for the equality of the underlying data blocks.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
        return False
    
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    
    if self.axes != other.axes:
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False
    
    return True
```
