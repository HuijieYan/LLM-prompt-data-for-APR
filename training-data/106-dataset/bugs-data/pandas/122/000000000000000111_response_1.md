Potential error location: The function is comparing the blocks of two DataFrames using the equals() method, but it is not accounting for the possibility of the same blocks having different locations, which can result in incorrect comparison results.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where blocks are identical but have different locations.

Approach to fixing the bug: The function needs to consider the possibility of blocks having different locations when comparing them. One approach could be to sort the blocks based on their type name and locations before comparing them.

```python
# Corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
