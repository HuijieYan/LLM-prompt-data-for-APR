Potential Error Location: The potential error location is in the condition `if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes))`. The `equals` method is being called on `ax1` and `ax2`, but it is likely that `ax1` and `ax2` are not objects that have an `equals` method, leading to the error.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug occurs because the code is assuming that the objects in `self_axes` and `other_axes` have an `equals` method, but this may not be the case. Without this method, the comparison will fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check that `ax1` and `ax2` have an `equals` method before calling it.
2. If the objects do not have an `equals` method, consider using another appropriate method for comparison.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(hasattr(ax1, 'equals') and ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
