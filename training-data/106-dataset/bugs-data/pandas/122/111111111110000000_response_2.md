The bug in the 'equals' function is that there is another function with the same name defined within the 'BlockManager' class. This is causing the wrong function to be called when trying to compare two DataFrames using the 'equals' method.

To fix this, the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class needs to be renamed to something else, and the 'equals' function needs to be corrected with the necessary parameters and logic for comparing DataFrames.

The corrected 'equals' function should look like this:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the necessary parameters and logic for comparing DataFrames.

Additionally, the 'equals' method within the 'BlockManager' class needs to be renamed to avoid conflicts.
