Potential Error Location:
The error is likely to be in the 'equals' function as indicated by the error message, which mentions the 'equals' method of the dataframe class.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison between the two dataframes. It could be that the comparison is not being performed correctly due to a bug in the 'equals' method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of axes and blocks is performed correctly.
2. Check for any inconsistencies in the sorting and comparison of blocks.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        return False
    
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks, other_blocks = self._consolidate().blocks, other._consolidate().blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._is_categorical, type(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
