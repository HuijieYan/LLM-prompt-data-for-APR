Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `equals` method being called on the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2`.

Reason for Bug: The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `equals` method. It is not handling the comparison between the two DataFrames correctly, which is causing the assertion error in the test function.

Possible Fix: The `equals` method should compare the columns and values of the two DataFrames to determine if they are equal. This can be achieved by sorting and comparing the blocks of the two DataFrames in the corrected implementation.

Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
