The buggy function in this case is the `equals` function. The function seems to compare two DataFrames but due to an incorrect implementation, it fails to do so and results in an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the comparison of DataFrames with different data types in corresponding columns. Specifically, in the given test case, df1 has column 'a' as integer type and column 'b' as string type, while df2 has column 'a' as string type and column 'b' as integer type. This causes the comparison to fail, which leads to the assertion error.

To fix this issue, the comparison logic needs to be updated to handle cases where the columns have different data types. One way to approach this is to convert the data types of corresponding columns so that they match and then perform the comparison.

The corrected function for the `equals` method is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparing block values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        self_block = self_blocks[i]
        other_block = other_blocks[i]
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

This updated function compares the blocks directly, handling cases where the columns have different data types. It loops through each block and compares them individually, ensuring that the comparison is done accurately.
