The function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects along their axes and blocks. It checks if their axes are of the same length and if the blocks in each `BlockManager` are equal after being sorted. The function then consolidates the blocks and returns the result of the comparison.

Given the expected output for the test case, it seems that the comparison logic for the blocks and axes is faulty. The function needs to compare the axes correctly and then sort and compare the blocks based on the dtype and mgr_locs. 

The bug occurs because:
1. The comparison logic is incorrect – the function attempts to compare `Block` objects directly, but it should compare them based on their dtype and mgr_locs, which represent the block type and memory locations, respectively.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the comparison logic for the axes – the function should check if the axes are equal based on their values.
2. Sort and compare the blocks based on their `dtype` and `mgr_locs`.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
