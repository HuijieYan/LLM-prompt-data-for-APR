The `equals` method is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects. The error message from the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` indicates that the comparison is not returning the expected value.

The potential error in the `equals` method is related to the implementation of comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It seems that the implementation around sorting and comparing these blocks is causing the issue, resulting in the comparison not returning the expected value.

The bug appears to be because of the inaccurate implementation of sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, and the subsequent comparison. This is leading to the method not performing the comparison correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be revisited. The sorting and comparison logic using the `canonicalize` function should be thoroughly reviewed, and the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` should be performed correctly. Additionally, it might be necessary to adjust the sorting or comparison to make the behavior coherent with the expected functionality of the `equals` method.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly for equality
    for block1, block2 in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        # Ensure the blocks are of the same type
        if type(block1) != type(block2):
            return False
        # Check if the blocks are equal
        if not block1.equals(block2):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, the `equals` method iterates through the blocks directly and checks for equality between corresponding blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This ensures that the comparison is done in a straightforward manner, addressing the potential issues with the previous sorting and comparison logic.
