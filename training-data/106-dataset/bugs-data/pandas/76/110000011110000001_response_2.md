The error message indicates an OverflowError, specifically "OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long". This likely means that the value "31900441201190696999" in the test data is too large to be converted to an integer in Python.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the coercion of data to "int64" or "int". When trying to coerce data to "int64", it seems that the function does not handle cases where the input data is a string representation of a number that is too large to be converted to an integer.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not consider cases where the input data is a string representation of a very large number that cannot be coerced into an integer or int64 without causing an overflow in Python.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_try_convert_data` function to handle the case where the input data is a string representation of a number that is too large to be converted to an integer. This could involve checking the length of the input data, and if it is a string representation of a number and its length is greater than the maximum length of an integer, then returning the original data without coercion.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False
    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try coercing object dtype to int
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            if (new_data == data).all():
                data = new_data
                result = True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, we added a specific attempt to coerce object dtype to "int64" and handle any possible ValueError or OverflowError that might occur during the conversion. This addresses the issue of large numbers represented as strings being coerced into integers.
