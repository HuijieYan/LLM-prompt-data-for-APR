The test case `test_frame_int_overflow` is aimed at testing the conversion of a JSON object into a Pandas DataFrame. The JSON object has a column with a string value that represents a large integer, and another column with a string value that is not a valid integer.

The error message indicates that there is an `OverflowError` due to Python integer being too large to convert to a C long. This error occurs during the process of attempting to convert the string representing a large integer to an integer type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section where it tries to coerce string data into integer data types. The code attempts to convert string data directly to 'int64' without handling large integer values, leading to an overflow error.

To fix the issue, a try-except block should be added to handle the conversion of the large integer string without causing an overflow. Additionally, a check for non-integer string values should be implemented to prevent potential conversion errors.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like column by inferring dtype.
    """

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    try:
        # try to convert data to int64
        new_data = data.astype('int64')
        return new_data, True
    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
        pass

    return data, result
```

In this corrected code, a try-except block is added for converting the data directly to 'int64'. This allows for handling large integer values without causing an overflow error. Additionally, the function checks for non-integer string values, and if an error occurs during the conversion, it falls back to returning the original data.
