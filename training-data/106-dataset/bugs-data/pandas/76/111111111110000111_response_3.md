The error message indicates that there is an OverflowError due to a Python int being too large to convert to a C long. This means that when trying to convert a very large number string to an integer, it exceeds the maximum size for an integer in Python.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it tries to convert the data to an integer.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to convert a very large number string to an integer without taking into account the possibility of overflow.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the conversion of large number strings to integers by using a data type that can accommodate larger numbers such as 'int64' or 'float64'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if len(data) and (data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object"):
        # coerce ints if we can
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            if (new_data == data).all():
                data = new_data
                result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, I've added a try-except block to handle the potential OverflowError when converting large number strings to integers. Instead of directly converting to "int64", I've used a try-except block to catch any potential OverflowError and handle it gracefully.
