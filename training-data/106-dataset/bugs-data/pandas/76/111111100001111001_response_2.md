The function `_try_convert_data` is intended to be used for trying to parse an array-like object into a column by inferring its data type. The function is also supposed to check for date conversion if specified and then apply various coercions based on the input data type.

Looking at the function and the provided test cases, it seems that there is an issue with the `convert_dates` option. Firstly, there is no handling of the `convert_dates` option which is passed as an argument into the function. The variable `convert_dates` is checked upon, but there is no handling based on its state.

Additionally, the `self._try_convert_to_date()` function is called without any handling for its result. The result of this call should be checked and used accordingly, but in the code provided, it is not.

To fix the issues mentioned, the following changes should be implemented:
1. Check `convert_dates` and call `_try_convert_to_date` only if `convert_dates` is `True`.
2. Handle the result from the call to `_try_convert_to_date`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse an array-like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """
    result = False

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            # dtype to force
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, convert_result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if convert_result:
            return new_data, True
        result = result or convert_result  # Update result based on the conversion result

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try float
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
    
    # Remaining code to coerce data types should follow
    # ...
    
    return data, result
```

The corrected code now checks for the `convert_dates` option and handles the result of the call to `_try_convert_to_date` appropriately. It keeps track of the conversion result in the `result` variable, ensuring that the final result indicates if any conversions were successful.
