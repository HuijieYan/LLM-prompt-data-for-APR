Issue:
The function `_try_convert_to_date` is a part of the `Parser` class. When it is called from the function `_try_convert_data`, the result of the date conversion is not being returned correctly. This results in a failure to return the correct variable values.

Correction:
To resolve this issue, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should return the result correctly and the `_try_convert_data` function should be updated to correctly handle the returned result.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, result

    # ... omitted code ...
```

By explicitly returning the `new_data` and `result` from the `_try_convert_to_date` function, we ensure that the correct values are returned and handled in the `_try_convert_data` function.

This correction will ensure that the correct variable values are returned and handled appropriately in the `_try_convert_data` function.
