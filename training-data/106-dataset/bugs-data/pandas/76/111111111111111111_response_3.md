The error message indicates an OverflowError, specifically "OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long", which suggests that the bug is related to the conversion of large numbers in the input data.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of data to type "int64" using the `astype` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when attempting to convert very large numbers to "int64", Python attempts to convert them to regular integers first, which may cause overflow errors due to the size of the numbers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_try_convert_data` function to handle large numbers differently. Instead of attempting to convert large numbers to "int64", we can choose to keep them as objects (strings) to avoid overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            # dtype to force
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    # deal with large numbers by keeping them as objects
    if data.dtype == "int64" and any(abs(x) > 9223372036854775807 for x in data):
        return data, False

    # handle other cases
    result = False
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("float64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
    
    if data.dtype.kind == "f":
        if data.dtype != "float64":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("float64")
                return new_data, True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
    
    if len(data) and (data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object"):
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            if (new_data == data).all():
                return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
    
    if data.dtype == "int":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            return new_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In this corrected code, large numbers are explicitly checked, and if they exceed the range of "int64", they are returned as objects without attempting to convert them, thereby avoiding overflow errors.
