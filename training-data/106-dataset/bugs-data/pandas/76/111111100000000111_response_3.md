Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_try_convert_data` method, specifically in the section where it attempts to coerce large numbers to float or int.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the conversion of large number strings to float or int. This is causing an overflow error as the numbers are too big to be represented accurately as floats.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of attempting to directly convert the large number strings to float or int, the code should handle these cases differently, such as converting the strings to scientific notation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try float
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
            if not new_data.isnull().all():
                return new_data, True
        except ValueError:
            pass

    return data, False
```

In this corrected code, the attempt to coerce the large number strings to float or int has been replaced with `pd.to_numeric` method, which will handle the conversion to float using scientific notation for large numbers. This should address the overflow error when dealing with big number strings.
