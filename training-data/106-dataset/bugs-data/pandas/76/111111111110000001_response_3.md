The error is occurring due to an attempt to convert a very large number to an integer. This is causing an overflow error because the number is too large to be represented as an integer in Python.

The potential error location within the function is in the block of code where it attempts to coerce integers to 64-bit integers. It does this by using `data.astype("int64")`. If the data contains a very large number, this conversion can cause an overflow error.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if the `data` in question can be safely converted to an integer, and if it can't, simply skip the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (previous code) ...

    # don't try to coerce, unless a force conversion
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype:
            return data, False
        elif self.dtype is True:
            pass
        else:
            # dtype to force
            dtype = (
                self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            )
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try float
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    if data.dtype.kind == "f":
        if data.dtype != "float64":
            # coerce floats to 64
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
    
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # check if data can be safely converted to int
    if data.dtype == "int" and (data <= np.iinfo(np.int64).max).all() and (data >= np.iinfo(np.int64).min).all():
        try:
            data = data.astype("int64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, we added a check before attempting to convert the data to `int64` to ensure that the data does not exceed the maximum and minimum values that can be safely represented as an integer. If the data falls within the safe range, only then the conversion to `int64` is attempted.
