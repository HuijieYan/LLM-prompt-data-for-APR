The potential error in the problematic function is the use of `data.dtype` without checking if `data` is a numpy array. This can lead to an AttributeError if `data` is not a numpy array.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `data` is indeed a numpy array before accessing its `dtype`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
        """
        
        if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
            data = np.array(data)

        # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

By adding the check `if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray): data = np.array(data)`, we ensure that `data` is converted to a numpy array before accessing its `dtype`, preventing any potential AttributeError.
