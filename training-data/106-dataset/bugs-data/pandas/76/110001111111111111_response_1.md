The issue is occurring while trying to convert a large number in a JSON string to a dataframe using the `read_json` function. The problem seems to be related to the data type conversion of the large number.

The error occurs in the `_try_convert_data` function, specifically in the part where it tries to convert the data to `int64` using `data.astype("int64")`. The error message indicates an overflow error when converting the large number string to an integer.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is attempting to directly convert the large number string to an integer without considering the possibility of overflow.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_data` function to handle the conversion of large number strings to avoid overflow errors.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# relative function's signature in this file
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the updated function
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try converting to float
        try:
            numeric_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
            if not np.isnan(numeric_data).all():
                return numeric_data, True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    return data, result
```

In the updated code, I have used `pd.to_numeric` to convert the data to numeric values with error handling in case of large numbers. This should prevent any overflow errors when attempting to convert large number strings to integers.

After applying this fix, the `read_json` function should be able to handle large number strings in the JSON and return the expected dataframe without overflow errors.
