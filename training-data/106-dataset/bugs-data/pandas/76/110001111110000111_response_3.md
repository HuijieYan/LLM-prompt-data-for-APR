The error message indicates an OverflowError due to a Python int that is too large to convert to C long. This error occurs when trying to convert a string representing a very large number to an integer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the code segment where it attempts to convert the data to int64:

```python
new_data = data.astype("int64")
```

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the input data is a string representing a large number, causing an integer overflow when trying to convert it to int64.

To fix the bug, we can modify the _try_convert_data function to handle the case where the input data is a string representing a large number by converting it to a float instead of an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """
    
    # ... (other code)
    
    if data.dtype == "object":

        # try float
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

        # convert large number strings to float
        try:
            data = data.astype(float)
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # ... (other code)

    return data, result
```

By handling the conversion of large number strings to float, the corrected function should now be able to parse the JSON input containing big number strings without causing an overflow error.
