The error message indicates an "OverflowError" due to the attempt to convert a Python int to a C long, which implies that the integer value is too large.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location is the conversion of the data to "int64" in the '_try_convert_data' function. The large integer value in the JSON input is causing an overflow error when attempting this conversion.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to convert the large integer value to "int64" directly without considering the possibility of an overflow. Additionally, since the method is inferring the data type, it's not handling large integer values appropriately.

One possible approach to fixing this bug could be to handle large integers using a different data type or a custom handling mechanism to prevent overflow errors. This can be achieved by checking the size of the integer value and conditionally converting it to a suitable type (e.g., 'float' or 'object') if it exceeds the range of "int64".

The corrected code for the '_try_convert_data' function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    if use_dtypes:
        if not self.dtype or self.dtype is True:
            return data, False
        else:
            dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            if dtype is not None:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    return data.astype(dtype), True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    return data, False
    
    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True
    
    result = False
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
        return data, result
```

This code removes the direct conversion to "int64" and instead handles large integers within the "object" data type, preventing overflow errors.
