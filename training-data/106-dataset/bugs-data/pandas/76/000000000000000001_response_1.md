Potential error location: The function is trying to convert data to a specific data type based on the information provided in the 'dtype' attribute. However, there are some inconsistencies and potential errors in the conversion process.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of data types and errors not being properly caught during the conversion process. Additionally, there are some redundancies and unnecessary checks in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the 'dtype' attribute is properly defined and handled.
2. Use exception handling to catch errors during data type conversion and provide appropriate fallbacks.
3. Remove redundant and unnecessary checks to simplify the function.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_data method:

```python
import numpy as np

class ClassName:
    # corrected _try_convert_data method
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        result = False

        if use_dtypes and self.dtype:
            dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            try:
                dtype = np.dtype(dtype)  # try to convert dtype
                data = data.astype(dtype)
                return data, True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        if convert_dates:
            new_data, converted = self._try_convert_to_date(data)  # assuming _try_convert_to_date exists
            if converted:
                return new_data, True

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        if data.dtype.kind == "f" and data.dtype != "float64":
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        if len(data) and (data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object"):
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
                if (new_data == data).all():
                    data = new_data
                    result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        if data.dtype == "int":
            try:
                data = data.astype("int64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        return data, result
```

In the corrected code:
- We've handled the 'dtype' attribute more effectively by using a try-except block to catch errors during data type conversion.
- We've removed unnecessary checks and simplified the logic to handle conversions more efficiently.
