The potential error in the provided code is likely to be in the section where the data type conversions are being attempted. The code seems to have multiple try-except blocks to handle different data type conversions, but it might be prone to errors due to inconsistent handling of data types and conversion attempts.

The bug is likely occurring because of inconsistent handling of data types and conversion attempts. The code is trying to handle different data type conversions but might not be covering all possible cases. Additionally, the code is not handling exceptions in a consistent manner.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the function to have a more structured approach to data type conversion. It would be beneficial to handle the data type conversions in a more explicit manner and include comprehensive error handling for different cases of data type conversion.

Here's the corrected function for the problematic section:

```python
# Class declaration containing the buggy function
class Parser():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Signature of a relative function in this class
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # Correction for the buggy function
    def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
        """

        result = False

        if use_dtypes and self.dtype:
            dtype = self.dtype.get(name) if isinstance(self.dtype, dict) else self.dtype
            if dtype:
                try:
                    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
                    data = data.astype(dtype)
                    result = True
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    pass

        if convert_dates:
            new_data, date_conversion_result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
            if date_conversion_result:
                return new_data, True

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                data = data.astype("float64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
            else:
                if data.dtype.kind == "f":
                    if data.dtype != "float64":
                        try:
                            data = data.astype("float64")
                            result = True
                        except (TypeError, ValueError):
                            pass

        if len(data) and (data.dtype == "float" or data.dtype == "object"):
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
                if (new_data == data).all():
                    data = new_data
                    result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        if data.dtype == "int":
            try:
                data = data.astype("int64")
                result = True
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        return data, result
```

In the corrected function, the data type conversions are structured in a more systematic manner, and consistent error handling is applied throughout the function. This should help in resolving the potential errors and improving the reliability of the data type conversion process.
