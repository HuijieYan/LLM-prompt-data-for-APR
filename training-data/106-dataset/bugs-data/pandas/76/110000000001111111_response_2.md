The bug seems to be occurring when the function is unable to parse a big number string from the JSON data. This results in incorrect data being returned or an error.

The potential error location within the function is in the section where it tries to coerce the data into different types, including converting big number strings to floats or integers.

The reason behind the bug is that when the big number strings are encountered, the function fails to coerce them into the desired types, resulting in incorrect output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the parsing of big number strings separately and maybe use a library like `Decimal` to handle very large numbers. Additionally, we can improve the error handling to make the function more resilient.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` method:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    # unchanged code...

    if convert_dates:
        new_data, result = self._try_convert_to_date(data)
        if result:
            return new_data, True

    result = False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        # try parsing big number strings
        try:
            data = data.apply(lambda x: Decimal(x) if x.isdigit() else x)
            return data, True
        except Exception:
            pass

        # other conversion attempts...
    
    return data, result
```

In the corrected code, we are attempting to parse the big number strings separately using the `Decimal` library. If the parsing is successful, we return the parsed data. Otherwise, we continue with the other conversion attempts. This should handle the issue with large number strings in the JSON data.
