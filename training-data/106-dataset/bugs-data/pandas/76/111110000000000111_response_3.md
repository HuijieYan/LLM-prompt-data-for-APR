The error seems to be related to the conversion of the big number string to a dataframe. The issue appears to be with the function `_try_convert_data` in the `Parser` class.

The potential error location is within the section where the function tries to convert the data to a float. Since the number is a big integer, it seems that the function is unable to handle it properly, leading to the incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the data can be converted to a float without considering the size of the number. When dealing with big numbers, this assumption leads to an overflow error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion of the big number string to a float properly. One possible approach is to use a try-except block to catch the potential overflow error and handle it gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_data` function:

```python
def _try_convert_data(self, name, data, use_dtypes=True, convert_dates=True):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a column by inferring dtype.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    if data.dtype.kind == "O":
        try:
            data = data.astype("float64")
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return data, result
```

In this corrected code, we added an `OverflowError` exception to the `try-except` block to handle the potential overflow error when converting the big number string to a float. This should help resolve the issue with parsing big number strings when converting to a dataframe.
