The error seems to be caused by a mismatch in the file path between the input parameter and the variable `filepath_or_buffer`. The input file path is `'/var/folders/ng/72llsm517x12c2p18htksyjc0000gn/T/tmpt8dxan41test.json'`, whereas the `filepath_or_buffer` variable is not being initialized within the function. This could lead to the DataFrame reader trying to read from a different path, resulting in the unexpected data being returned.

To fix this bug, the `filepath_or_buffer` variable should be explicitly initialized with the value of the `path_or_buf` input parameter. This will ensure that the function reads the JSON from the correct file path.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding=None,
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    compression = _infer_compression(path_or_buf, compression)
    filepath_or_buffer = path_or_buf  # Initialize filepath_or_buffer with the input path_or_buf
    should_close = False

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

By explicitly setting `filepath_or_buffer = path_or_buf`, the function will use the correct file path for reading the JSON data, and it should return the expected result.
