The issue in the provided function `read_json` is that it doesn't honor the default encoding when opening a file, as mentioned in the documentation. The function is calling the built-in `open()` method to open a file, and `open()` uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding, which may not be UTF-8 in some cases.

To fix this issue, the `read_json` function should explicitly specify the encoding as `utf-8` when opening the file if the encoding parameter is not given.

Corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding=None,
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer"
):
    # ... (other function code is unchanged)

    # Check if encoding is not provided, use utf-8 as the default encoding
    if encoding is None:
        encoding = 'utf-8'

    # Update the code to use the specified encoding when opening the file
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    # ... (remaining function code is unchanged)
```

With these changes, the function will now explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when opening the file, ensuring that the default encoding mentioned in the documentation is honored.
