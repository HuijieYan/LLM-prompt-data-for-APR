The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns have different values. The test case writes a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then attempts to read it using the `read_json()` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the file opening part:
```python
with open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write('{"£©µÀÆÖÞßéöÿ":["АБВГДабвгд가"]}')
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `read_json()` function is called without an explicit encoding parameter, it uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` to determine the encoding for file handling. This can potentially lead to an incorrect encoding being used when reading the file, causing non-ASCII characters to be misinterpreted.

To fix the bug, the `read_json()` function should explicitly open the file with the `utf-8` encoding to ensure that non-ASCII characters are properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json()` function:

```python
def read_json(
        path_or_buf=None,
        orient=None,
        typ="frame",
        dtype=None,
        convert_axes=None,
        convert_dates=True,
        keep_default_dates=True,
        numpy=False,
        precise_float=False,
        date_unit=None,
        encoding="utf-8",  # Explicitly specify the encoding
        lines=False,
        chunksize=None,
        compression="infer",
    ):
        """
        Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
        
        ... (other function documentation remains the same)
        """
        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By explicitly specifying the `encoding` parameter with the value `"utf-8"` in the function signature, the `read_json()` function will ensure that non-ASCII characters are properly handled when reading the JSON file.
