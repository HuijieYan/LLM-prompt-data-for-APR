The error message indicates that the "read_json" function is not using the correct encoding when opening the file. The DataFrame contains different column values, which is attributed to the encoding issue.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "filepath_or_buffer" object creation using the "get_filepath_or_buffer" function.

The bug occurs because the function uses the locale's preferred encoding to open the file, which might not always be UTF-8. The test case uses UTF-8 encoding, while the function defaults to the system's preferred encoding.

To fix the bug, the "encoding" parameter needs to be set to "utf-8" when calling "get_filepath_or_buffer" to ensure that the file is opened using UTF-8 encoding regardless of the system's preferred encoding.

Below is the corrected code for the "read_json" function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding=None,  # Added encoding parameter
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # Existing code...

    # Set encoding parameter for file opening
    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding="utf-8", compression=compression  # Use UTF-8 encoding
    )

    # Existing code...
```

By adding the "encoding" parameter and setting it to "utf-8" when calling "get_filepath_or_buffer", we ensure that the file is opened using UTF-8 encoding, resolving the bug.
