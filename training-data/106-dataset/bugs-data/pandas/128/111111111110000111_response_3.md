Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the encoding used when reading the JSON file. The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different, which suggests that the encoding might be causing the issue.

The potential error location seems to be in the `read_json` function where the file is being opened without explicitly specifying the encoding.

The bug is occurring because when `read_json` is called without the encoding parameter, it internally uses built-in `open()` method to open the file and relies on the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()`. If the `locale.getpreferredencoding()` returns a value other than 'utf-8', it can cause issues with reading the JSON file.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the file is opened with the correct encoding. One approach to fix the bug is to explicitly specify the `utf-8` encoding when opening the file in the `read_json` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding="utf-8",  # Explicitly specify the encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    # Previous code for opening the file
    # filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
    #     path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    # )
    # New code to explicitly open the file with utf-8 encoding
    if not encoding:
        encoding = "utf-8"
    should_close = True if isinstance(path_or_buf, str) else False
    if isinstance(path_or_buf, str):
        with open(path_or_buf, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
            filepath_or_buffer = file
    else:
        filepath_or_buffer = path_or_buf

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

In the corrected `read_json` function, the `encoding` parameter is explicitly specified with a default value of "utf-8". Additionally, the file is opened using the `open()` method with the specified encoding.

This fix ensures that the JSON file is read with the correct encoding, which should resolve the encoding-related issues when reading the file.
