The potential error location is at the start of the `read_json` function, where it checks the value of the `encoding` parameter. If the `encoding` parameter is not provided, it should default to 'utf-8'. However, it seems to use the system's preferred encoding instead. The input has resulted in garbled characters, indicating that the encoding used was not 'utf-8'.

The bug occurs because the function does not explicitly specify the 'utf-8' encoding when reading the JSON file. Instead, it relies on the system's preferred encoding, which may not always be 'utf-8', leading to unexpected behavior and character encoding issues.

To fix this bug, the `read_json` function should explicitly specify the 'utf-8' encoding when reading the JSON file to ensure consistent and expected behavior in different environments.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly specify 'utf-8' encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    """
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Verify that the desired encoding is being used
    with open(path_or_buf, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file:
        data = file.read()

    # Continue with the rest of the function
    # ...

```

In the corrected code, the `encoding='utf-8'` parameter is explicitly set in the `read_json` function signature to ensure that the 'utf-8' encoding is used when reading the JSON file. Additionally, within the function, the file is opened using the specified encoding to guarantee that the data is read with the correct character encoding.
