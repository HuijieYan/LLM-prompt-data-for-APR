The test case `test_readjson_unicode` writes a JSON file with non-ASCII characters using UTF-8 encoding and then tries to read it using `read_json()`. The bug is reported because the columns of the resulting DataFrame are not as expected. The bug arises from the encoding used to read the JSON file.

The potential error location is within the `read_json()` function, where the `encoding` parameter is not explicitly specified when opening the file using `open()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the default locale encoding is not UTF-8.

The bug occurs because the `read_json()` function uses the return value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` as the default encoding when not explicitly specified. If the default locale encoding is not UTF-8, it can lead to incorrect decoding of non-ASCII characters from the JSON file.

To fix the bug, one approach is to explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when opening the file using `open()` to ensure consistent decoding of the non-ASCII characters.

The corrected code for the `read_json()` function is as follows:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly specifying UTF-8 encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (omitted code)

    filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    # ... (omitted code)

    # Read the file using the explicitly specified UTF-8 encoding
    with open(filepath_or_buffer, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Parse the content and return the result
    result = parse_json(content)

    # ... (omitted code)
```
