The code provided defines a function `read_json` which is meant to convert a JSON string to a pandas object. It takes multiple parameters to specify the behavior of the conversion, such as the file path or buffer, the data orientation, data type, compression, etc.

The `read_json` function seems to have a potential bug related to the `compression` parameter. It uses the `_infer_compression` function to determine the compression type, but it doesn't handle the case where the compression type cannot be inferred.

The bug occurs because if the compression type cannot be inferred, the `filepath_or_buffer` variable might contain an opened file handler or IO object. In the case where the compression type cannot be inferred, the function doesn't handle this properly and doesn't close the file handler, leading to potential resource leaks.

To fix this issue, we should modify the code to handle the case where the compression type cannot be inferred and ensure that the file handler or IO object is closed properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding=None,
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    """
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if orient == "table" and dtype:
        raise ValueError("cannot pass both dtype and orient='table'")
    if orient == "table" and convert_axes:
        raise ValueError("cannot pass both convert_axes and orient='table'")

    if dtype is None and orient != "table":
        dtype = True
    if convert_axes is None and orient != "table":
        convert_axes = True

    compression = _infer_compression(path_or_buf, compression)
    filepath_or_buffer, handle = get_filepath_or_buffer(
        path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
    )

    json_reader = JsonReader(
        filepath_or_buffer,
        orient=orient,
        typ=typ,
        dtype=dtype,
        convert_axes=convert_axes,
        convert_dates=convert_dates,
        keep_default_dates=keep_default_dates,
        numpy=numpy,
        precise_float=precise_float,
        date_unit=date_unit,
        encoding=encoding,
        lines=lines,
        chunksize=chunksize,
        compression=compression,
        handle=handle,
    )

    if chunksize:
        return json_reader

    result = json_reader.read()

    if handle is not None:
        handle.close()

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we obtain both the `filepath_or_buffer` and a handle from the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function. The `handle` is returned when the compression type is not 'infer', which means the file or buffer is opened, and we need to ensure that it is closed properly after the JSON string is converted to a pandas object.
