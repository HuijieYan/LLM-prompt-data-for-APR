The test case is attempting to write a JSON file with non-ASCII characters and then read it back using the `read_json` function. However, the function is failing to correctly handle the encoding, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual data frames.

The potential error location within the `read_json` function is the point where the encoding is handled during the file reading process.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The function does not explicitly handle the file encoding, which can lead to discrepancies when reading files with non-ASCII characters.
2. The `open` function uses a different encoding (`utf-8`) than the one set by the monkeypatch (`cp949`), leading to encoding issues.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle file encoding explicitly, ensuring consistent encoding when reading the file.
2. If a specific encoding is provided, use it to open the file, ensuring that the read and write operations use the same encoding.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def read_json(path_or_buf=None, orient=None, typ="frame", dtype=None, convert_axes=None, convert_dates=True, keep_default_dates=True, numpy=False, precise_float=False, date_unit=None, encoding="utf-8", lines=False, chunksize=None, compression="infer"):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    """

    # Existing code
    # ...

    # Update the file reading process to use the specified encoding
    with open(path_or_buf, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
        data = file.read()

    # Continue with the rest of the function
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `open` function explicitly specifies the encoding parameter to ensure that the file is read using the specified encoding. This should resolve the encoding mismatch issue encountered in the test case.
