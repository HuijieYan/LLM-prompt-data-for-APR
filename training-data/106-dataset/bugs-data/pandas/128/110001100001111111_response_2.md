With the provided information, it seems like the issue is with the default encoding used by the `read_json` function. It appears that the `open()` function used within the `read_json` function is determining the encoding using `locale.getpreferredencoding()`, which can result in an encoding other than UTF-8 being used.

The bug seems to be happening because the default behaviour of the `read_json` function should use utf-8 for encoding, but it relies on the system's preferred encoding, which can be a non-UTF-8 encoding in some cases. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect decoding of the JSON data.

To resolve this issue, the `read_json` function should explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when opening the file, rather than relying on the system's preferred encoding. This will ensure that the JSON data is decoded using the correct encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Explicitly specify UTF-8 encoding
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    (Rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """
```

By explicitly specifying the encoding as UTF-8 in the `read_json` function, it ensures that the JSON data is decoded using the correct encoding, regardless of the system's preferred encoding.

This correction should address the issue where the `read_json` function doesn't use UTF-8 as the default encoding.
