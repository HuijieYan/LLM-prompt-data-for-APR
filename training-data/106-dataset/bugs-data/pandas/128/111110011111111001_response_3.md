The test case `test_readjson_unicode` writes a JSON object with Unicode characters to a file and then attempts to read it using the `read_json` function. The expected result is a DataFrame with the same Unicode characters.

The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different:
- The left DataFrame has columns with Unicode characters '짙짤쨉��횈횜횧횩챕철첼'
- The right DataFrame should have columns with Unicode characters '£©µÀÆÖÞßéöÿ'

The error occurs because the `read_json` function does not decode the Unicode characters correctly, resulting in different column names in the returned DataFrame.

The potential error location in the `read_json` function is the handling of the encoding parameter, which affects how the JSON string is decoded.

To fix the bug:
- Check if the encoding parameter is correctly passed to the file reading operations.
- Ensure that the Unicode characters in the JSON string are decoded properly, taking into account the specified encoding.

Here's the corrected `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding="utf-8",  # Set default encoding to utf-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # Read the file using the specified encoding
    with open(filepath_or_buffer, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
        data = file.read()

    # Proceed with JSON decoding and DataFrame creation

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By setting the default encoding to utf-8 and using the specified encoding when reading the file, we can ensure that the Unicode characters in the JSON string are decoded correctly. This should resolve the issue with incorrect column names in the returned DataFrame.
