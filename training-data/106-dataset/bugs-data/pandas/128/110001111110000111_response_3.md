The test case provided attempts to write a JSON file using the UTF-8 encoding and then use the `read_json()` function to read the JSON file. However, the function is not using UTF-8 encoding, which leads to an assertion error as the expected and actual dataframes do not match due to differences in column names.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of encoding while opening the file. The function is not using the specified encoding or the default UTF-8 encoding.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `read_json()` function does not explicitly specify the encoding parameter when opening the file, which leads to a reliance on the system's preferred encoding, which may not always be UTF-8.

To fix the bug, the `read_json()` function should explicitly specify the encoding parameter using UTF-8 to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json()` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Specify the encoding parameter as 'utf-8'
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (rest of the parameters remains the same)
    """

    # ... (existing function implementation remains the same) ...
```

By explicitly specifying the `encoding` parameter as 'utf-8' when opening the file, the bug should be resolved, and the `read_json()` function should consistently use UTF-8 encoding for reading JSON files.
