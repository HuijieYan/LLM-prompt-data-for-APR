The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns values are different, with one column value being in a different encoding. This is likely due to the encoding issue when reading the JSON file.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of encoding when opening the file. The read_json function should take care of encoding when reading the JSON file.

The bug occurs because the read_json function does not explicitly handle the encoding when opening the file, causing issues with non-UTF-8 default encodings. This results in the incorrect encoding being used to read the JSON file, leading to differences in DataFrame columns values.

To fix the bug, the read_json function needs to handle the encoding explicitly when opening the file, ensuring that the file is read with the correct encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the read_json function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import locale

# Fix for issues related to encoding when opening the file
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Set default encoding to UTF-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # Existing code...

    # Fix for encoding issue when reading the JSON file
    with open(path_or_buf, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
        json_data = file.read()

    # Use pandas' built-in read_json method with the loaded JSON data
    result = pd.read_json(json_data, orient=orient, typ=typ, dtype=dtype, convert_axes=convert_axes,
                          convert_dates=convert_dates, keep_default_dates=keep_default_dates,
                          numpy=numpy, precise_float=precise_float, date_unit=date_unit,
                          encoding=encoding, lines=lines, compression=compression)

    return result
```

With this correction, the read_json function explicitly handles the encoding when opening the file using the correct encoding. This should fix the issue related to default encoding when reading JSON files, as described in the bug report.
