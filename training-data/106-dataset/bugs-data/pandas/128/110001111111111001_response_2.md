The bug seems to be related to the encoding of the file being read. The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different, suggesting an issue with encoding and decoding non-ASCII characters.

Upon inspection of the provided function `read_json`, it is apparent that the error is likely due to the encoding parameter not being passed to the `open` function when reading the JSON file. The file is written using UTF-8 encoding, but it seems that the `read_json` function is not specifying the encoding when reading the file. This can cause issues with non-ASCII characters.

To fix this bug, the `encoding` parameter should be passed to the `open` function when reading the file. This will ensure that the file is decoded using the correct encoding.

Below is the corrected code for the `read_json` function with the necessary modification:

```python
def read_json(
        path_or_buf=None,
        orient=None,
        typ="frame",
        dtype=None,
        convert_axes=None,
        convert_dates=True,
        keep_default_dates=True,
        numpy=False,
        precise_float=False,
        date_unit=None,
        encoding=None,  # New parameter for encoding
        lines=False,
        chunksize=None,
        compression="infer",
    ):
        """
        Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
        """
        
        # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
        
        if dtype is None and orient != "table":
            dtype = True
        if convert_axes is None and orient != "table":
            convert_axes = True

        compression = _infer_compression(path_or_buf, compression)
        filepath_or_buffer, _, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
            path_or_buf, encoding=encoding, compression=compression
        )
        
        # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
```

By adding the `encoding` parameter to the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function, the correct encoding will be used when reading the file, which should resolve the issue.
