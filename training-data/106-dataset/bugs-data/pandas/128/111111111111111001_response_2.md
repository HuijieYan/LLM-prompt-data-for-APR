The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different, with the left side showing unexpected values. This could be due to an encoding issue when reading the JSON file.

The potential error location within the `read_json` function is likely in the file handling or encoding process. It's possible that when reading the JSON file, the encoding is not being handled correctly, leading to unexpected characters in the DataFrame.

The reason behind this bug is that the function does not handle the file encoding properly, resulting in unexpected characters being read from the JSON file.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the file encoding explicitly when reading the JSON file. Using the correct encoding will ensure that the special characters in the JSON file are read and processed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # set the default encoding to utf-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Open the file with the specified encoding
    with open(filepath_or_buffer, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
        data = file.read()

    # Process the JSON data
    result = pd.read_json(
        data,
        orient=orient,
        typ=typ,
        dtype=dtype,
        convert_axes=convert_axes,
        convert_dates=convert_dates,
        keep_default_dates=keep_default_dates,
        numpy=numpy,
        precise_float=precise_float,
        date_unit=date_unit,
        encoding=encoding,
        lines=lines,
        chunksize=chunksize,
        compression=compression,
    )

    # Return the processed data
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the reading of the file uses the specified encoding ('utf-8' by default) to ensure that the special characters in the JSON file are handled correctly. This should resolve the encoding issue and prevent unexpected characters in the DataFrame.
