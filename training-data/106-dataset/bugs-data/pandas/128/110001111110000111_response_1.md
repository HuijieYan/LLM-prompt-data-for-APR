The error message suggests that the incorrect encoding is being used when reading the JSON file, leading to a mismatch in the DataFrame columns.

The potential error location is at the point where the file is being opened without specifying the encoding.

The bug occurs because the function `read_json` does not specify the encoding when opening the file, leading to the use of the system's default encoding instead of UTF-8.

To fix the bug, you can explicitly specify the encoding as UTF-8 when opening the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_json` function:

```python
def read_json(
    path_or_buf=None,
    orient=None,
    typ="frame",
    dtype=None,
    convert_axes=None,
    convert_dates=True,
    keep_default_dates=True,
    numpy=False,
    precise_float=False,
    date_unit=None,
    encoding='utf-8',  # Corrected: specifying the encoding as UTF-8
    lines=False,
    chunksize=None,
    compression="infer",
):
    """
    Convert a JSON string to pandas object.
    ... (rest of the docstring and function implementation remains the same)
    """
```

By explicitly setting the `encoding` parameter to `'utf-8'` when calling `open` to read the file, the bug will be fixed, and the `read_json` function will use the correct encoding.
