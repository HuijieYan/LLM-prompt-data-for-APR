The buggy function is trying to define the behavior of the subtraction operation when a datetime-like object is subtracted from a timedelta-like object. The function should return the result of the subtraction, unless the types of the objects being subtracted are not compatible, in which case it should raise a TypeError.

The function seems to have some issues with handling the different types of input objects and their associated datatypes. The `is_datetime64_any_dtype` and `is_timedelta64_dtype` functions are being called but are not defined in the code provided. This might be causing some of the issues.

To fix the function, the following steps can be followed:
1. Ensure that the `is_datetime64_any_dtype` and `is_timedelta64_dtype` functions are defined and implemented correctly. These functions should return a boolean based on whether the input is of the specified type.
2. Update the function to check for different combinations of input types and return the correct result or raise a TypeError if the types are not compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp) and isinstance(self, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        return other - self
    elif isinstance(self, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and isinstance(other, np.datetime64):
        return other - self
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
```

It's important to note that the correct implementation of this function depends on the specific requirements and interpretations of the subtraction operation for datetime-like and timedelta-like objects in the context of the broader application.
