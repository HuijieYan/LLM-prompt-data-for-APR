The error occurs within the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that a `ValueError` is raised at line `raise ValueError(msg.format(type(values).__name__))`, specifically due to the unexpected type 'datetime64'.

The reason for this bug is that the `__rsub__` method is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` object from the `other` parameter, assuming that it is a datetime-like array. However, when the `other` parameter is of type `datetime64`, it should not be transformed into a `DatetimeArray`, leading to the unexpected type error.

To fix the bug, the code of the `__rsub__` method should be modified to handle the case where the `other` parameter is of type `datetime64` differently. It should not be transformed into a `DatetimeArray` in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if issubclass(type(other), np.datetime64):
            # Handle the case where other is a numpy.datetime64
            return other - self
        elif not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        # Handle other cases as before
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # Handle other cases as before
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Handle other cases as before
    return -(self - other)
```

This updated code first checks if the `other` parameter is a numpy datetime64. If it is, the subtraction is performed directly. If not, the rest of the function behaves as before. This change should prevent the ValueError from occurring when `other` is a `datetime64`.
