The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the DatetimeArray is being initialized with an unexpected type `datetime64`, which should instead be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or a Series or Index containing one of those.

The bug occurs because the `__rsub__` method is trying to initialize a `DatetimeArray` with a type that is not compatible, leading to a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `DatetimeArray` is initialized with the correct type. This could be achieved by changing the logic of how the `DatetimeArray` is initialized or checking the type of the input before initializing the `DatetimeArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            if isinstance(other, np.ndarray):
                other = DatetimeArray(other)
            elif isinstance(other, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
                other = DatetimeArray(other.array)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Unexpected type '{type(other).__name__}'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.")
        return other - self
    # ... other cases ...
```

In the corrected code, we first check the type of the `other` variable and based on its type, we initialize the `DatetimeArray` accordingly to avoid the ValueError.
