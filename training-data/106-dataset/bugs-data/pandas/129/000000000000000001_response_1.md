The potential error in the function is that it is not properly handling the subtraction operation for different data types. This could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior when subtracting datetime64, timedelta64, and other data types.

The function is trying to handle different data types such as datetime64, timedelta64, and other types, but the conditional statements and operations are not properly organized. This can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect results when performing operations.

To fix the bug, we can reorganize the conditional statements and operations to properly handle the subtraction for different data types. We also need to ensure that the appropriate types are being checked before performing operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if not hasattr(other, "dtype"):
        raise TypeError("unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'DatetimeArray' and '{}'".format(type(other).__name__))
    
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Perform subtraction for datetime64 and timedelta64
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # Perform subtraction for datetime64 and datetime64
        return other - self
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        # Perform subtraction for timedelta64 and timedelta64
        return other - self
    else:
        raise TypeError("unsupported operand type(s) for -: '{}' and '{}'".format(type(self).__name__, type(other).__name__))
```

This corrected function now properly handles different data types and performs the subtraction operation accordingly.
