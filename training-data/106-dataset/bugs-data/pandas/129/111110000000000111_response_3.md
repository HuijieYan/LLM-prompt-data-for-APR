The potential error in the buggy function is that the logic for the subtraction operation is not properly handling different data types and cases.

The bug occurs when the function tries to handle various data types and their interactions during the subtraction operation, such as datetime64, timedelta64, and period data types. The function does not properly handle these interactions, resulting in incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should have proper logic to handle different data types and their interactions during the subtraction operation. This could involve checking for the data type of the input 'other' and performing the subtraction accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self + other)  # Fixed the logic for subtraction and negation
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self + other)  # Fixed the logic for subtraction and negation
```

In this corrected code, the logic for handling different data types and their interactions during the subtraction operation has been updated to ensure that the results are calculated correctly.
