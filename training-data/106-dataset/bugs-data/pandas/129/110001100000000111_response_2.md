The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__rsub__` method of the DatetimeLikeArrayMixin class. The bug occurs because there are multiple conditional statements and the order of their evaluation may not be correct, leading to unexpected behavior.

It seems that the logic for handling the different data types (datetime64, timedelta64, and period) and their subtraction operations is not well-defined and might be causing the bug.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the different data types and their subtraction operations should be revised. The conditional statements should be re-evaluated and re-ordered to ensure that the correct operation is performed for each data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    from pandas.core.arrays.timedeltas import Timedelta, TimedeltaArray

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        return DatetimeArray(other) - self
    elif (
        is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype)
        and hasattr(other, "dtype")
        and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)
    ):
        return TimedeltaArray(self - other)
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -Timedelta(self._data - other)

        return Timedelta((-self._data) + other)

    return -Timedelta(self._data - other)
```
