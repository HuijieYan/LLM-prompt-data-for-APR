The buggy function is designed to handle different scenarios for subtracting the input `other` from the `self` object. The cases use different combinations of data types, such as Timestamp, datetime, and TimedeltaArray, along with their corresponding dtypes.

The bug occurs in the `__rsub__` function due to the conditional checks and logical flow. When analyzing the cases, it's evident that the current implementation of the function doesn't accurately handle the subtraction operations for different input types, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be modified to accurately handle the subtraction operations for different input types. This can be done by adjusting the conditional checks and ensuring that the correct subtraction and error handling mechanisms are in place.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(
                typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(
                dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype) and lib.is_scalar(other):
        return -self + other
    return NotImplemented
```

In the corrected code, the logic has been adjusted to handle different input types and corresponding subtraction operations more accurately. The error handling is also improved to provide clear error messages when necessary.
