Potential error location: The potential error lies in the logic used to handle the subtraction operation for different data types.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the logic for handling the subtraction operation is not handling all possible combinations of data types correctly. This leads to TypeError or incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling different data types and ensure that all combinations are handled appropriately.
2. Use isinstance checks to determine the data type of the 'other' parameter and handle the subtraction operation accordingly.
3. Consider refactoring the logic to make it more concise and easier to understand.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # GH#19959 datetime - datetime is well-defined as timedelta,
        # but any other type - datetime is not well-defined.
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        # TODO: Can we simplify/generalize these cases at all?
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
