The error seems to be caused by the `__rsub__` method in the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that the `DatetimeArray` constructor is being called with an unexpected type, causing a `ValueError`.

The bug is most likely due to the constructor for `DatetimeArray` expecting an array of datetime values, but it is being passed a single datetime object instead.

To fix the bug, the method needs to handle the case where a single datetime input needs to be converted into a `DatetimeArray` with a single value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            other = [other]  # Convert single value to list
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # ... other cases and conditions ...
```

In this corrected code, the `other` input is converted to a list when it is a single datetime value, and then it is passed to the `DatetimeArray` constructor.

This should handle the cases where a single datetime value is passed as the input and prevent the `ValueError` raised by the original code.
