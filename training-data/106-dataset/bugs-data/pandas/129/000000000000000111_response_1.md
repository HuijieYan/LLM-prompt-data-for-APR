Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the different data types and the logic for subtraction and negation.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the different data types and their subtraction and negation operations. This leads to the function returning incorrect results or raising TypeErrors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data types of 'self' and 'other' and handle the subtraction and negation operations accordingly.
2. Ensure that the correct exceptions are raised if the operations are not well-defined for the given data types.
3. Simplify the logic for handling different data types to make the function more readable and maintainable.

Corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, DatetimeIndex)):
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(other).__name__, typ=type(self).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(other).__name__, dtype=self.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self + other)
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
In the corrected code:
- The logic for handling different data types has been simplified and improved to ensure proper subtraction and negation operations.
- The exceptions are raised with the correct type information if the operations are not well-defined for the given data types.
- The code also ensures that the correct classes and methods are used for handling the datetime and timedelta operations.
