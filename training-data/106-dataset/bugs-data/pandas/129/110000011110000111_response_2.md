The error message indicates a type error: "Unexpected type 'datetime64'. 'values' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those." This error occurs when trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from `other` in the `__rsub__` method.

The issue is likely happening because the 'other' parameter passed to `__rsub__` is not of the expected type. The 'other' parameter is expected to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those, but it is being inferred as a 'datetime64' type.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that 'other' is properly transformed into the expected type before performing the subtraction operation.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the logic for handling the 'other' parameter in the `__rsub__` method. We can explicitly convert 'other' into a DatetimeArray if it is not already in that format.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeArray):
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # rest of the logic
```

By explicitly converting 'other' into a `DatetimeArray` if it's not already in that format, we make sure that the type of 'other' matches the expected format and avoid the type error mentioned in the error message.
