The buggy function is designed to perform subtraction operations involving datetime and timedelta elements. However, the function contains several conditional checks that are not correctly handling all cases, resulting in erroneous behavior.

Upon analyzing the input and expected test cases, it appears that the bug occurs due to improper handling of different combinations of datetime and timedelta values. The conditional checks within the function are not effectively differentiating between these cases, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle each combination of input types (datetime and timedelta) properly. This can be achieved by updating the conditional checks and logic to ensure that the appropriate operations are performed based on the types of the input values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if (is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) or isinstance(other, np.datetime64)) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, np.datetime64)):
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not (is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype) or isinstance(other, np.datetime64)):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)
        return (-self) + other
    return -(self - other)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been updated to handle datetime and timedelta values effectively, while also considering the possibility of numpy datetime objects. This should ensure consistent and correct behavior for all combinations of input values.
