The issue appears to be with the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The method seems to be wrongly converting the `other` parameter to a `DatetimeArray` which causes the `ValueError` to be raised due to the unexpected type 'datetime64' when trying to initialize the `DatetimeArray`.

The `__rsub__` method is used for subtraction when the left-hand side of the operation does not support the subtraction of the right-hand side. In this case, it seems the code is trying to handle different types of input for the subtraction operation (datetime, timedelta, period, etc.) and converting the `other` parameter to a `DatetimeArray` in the case of a datetime subtraction from a timedelta. 

To fix the issue, the conversion of the `other` parameter to a `DatetimeArray` needs to be handled differently. It seems that the conversion is not required in this case, as it should work with the original `other` parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
            raise TypeError(
                "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__)
            )
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
            return other + self
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                "unsupported type for subtraction operation"
            )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return other + self
        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessary conversion of the `other` parameter to a `DatetimeArray` and handles the different types of inputs for the subtraction operation accordingly.
