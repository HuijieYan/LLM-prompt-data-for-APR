The test function is testing addition and subtraction operations involving timedelta arrays and datetime-like scalars. It appears that the error is occurring in the subtraction operation.

Looking at the error message, it seems that the `DatetimeArray` is being instantiated with an unexpected `values` type of `datetime64`. This could be due to the condition in the original function where `DatetimeArray` is created using `other` in the case when `other` is not an instance of `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic for creating the `DatetimeArray` and handling the subtraction operation. We can check if `other` is a datetime-like object, and if so, create a `DatetimeArray` with appropriate values. Otherwise, we can perform the subtraction operation with the datetime-like object and return the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, (datetime, datetime64, Timestamp)):
            other = np.array(other, dtype='datetime64[ns]')
        
        return other - self
    elif (is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype")
          and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype)):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

In this corrected code:
- We handle the case where `other` is a datetime-like object by converting it to a NumPy array with dtype 'datetime64[ns]' before performing the subtraction operation.
- For other cases, the logic for handling the subtraction operation remains unchanged.

This should resolve the issue observed in the test function.
