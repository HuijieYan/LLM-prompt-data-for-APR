Potential Error Location: The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle all the possible scenarios for the subtraction operation between different data types.

Reasons for Bug: The bug occurs because the function does not have proper handling for all the different data types that could be involved in the subtraction operation.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add proper handling for all the different data types that could be involved in the subtraction operation, such as datetime, timedelta, period, and others.
2. Use conditional statements to check the data type of both operands and perform the subtraction accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        
        return other - self
    elif is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and hasattr(other, "dtype") and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(typ=type(other).__name__, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(dtype=other.dtype, cls=type(self).__name__))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)
        else:
            return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```
