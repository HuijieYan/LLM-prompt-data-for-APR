The buggy function is a method called `__rsub__` defined inside the class `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin`. The purpose of this method is to handle the subtraction operation when the right operand does not support subtraction from the left operand.

The bug occurs when the method is trying to subtract a `Timestamp` or `datetime` object from a `TimedeltaArray`. The bug arises from the conditional clauses and the operations inside them, which do not properly handle the different types and combinations of operands.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to properly handle each type of operand and their combinations. This may involve checking the type of the 'other' parameter and then performing the subtraction or raising a TypeError if the subtraction is not well-defined for the given combination of types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeIndex, DatetimeArray)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif isinstance(other, (pd.Timestamp, datetime)):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {typ}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__
            )
        )
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(other.dtype):
        raise TypeError(
            "cannot subtract {cls} from {dtype}".format(
                cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype
            )
        )
    else:
        # for all other cases, flip operation and subtract
        return -(self - other)
```
