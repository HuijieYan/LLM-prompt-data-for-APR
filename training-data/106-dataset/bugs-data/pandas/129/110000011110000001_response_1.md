The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message indicates that the input `other` is not in the expected format, and it needs to be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or a Series, or Index containing one of those.

The bug occurs because the `__rsub__` method is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` variable without checking its type. This causes an error when the type is not as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__rsub__` method to check the type of `other` before attempting to create a `DatetimeArray` from it. If it's not in the expected format, an appropriate error or exception should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` method:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            raise TypeError("Unexpected type of 'other'. It must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.")
        if not isinstance(other, DatetimeLikeArrayMixin):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    # (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected method, we check if `other` is of the expected type before attempting to create a `DatetimeArray` from it. If it's not the expected type, a TypeError is raised. If it is of the expected type, the method proceeds with the subtraction operation as before.
