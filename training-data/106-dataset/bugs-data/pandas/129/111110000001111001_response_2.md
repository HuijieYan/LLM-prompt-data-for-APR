The buggy function contains a logical error when determining the behavior for subtraction between different data types. The function checks for various conditions, such as when a timestamp is subtracted from a timedelta array, or when a timedelta is subtracted from an integer, etc. The function intends to handle these cases and return the correct output, but the current implementation contains logical flaws.

In each case, the function checks if the `other` parameter is of a certain type and the `self` parameter's data type matches some specific criteria. Based on these checks, different operations are performed. However, the combinations of conditions and the corresponding operations do not cover all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, a new implementation of the logic inside the function is needed. Instead of focusing on the data types of the parameters, the function should check for the data types of the operands involved in the subtraction operation. Depending on the types of the operands, the operation should be performed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__rsub__` function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
        # If other is a datetime object, handle the subtraction accordingly
        return other - self._data  # Assuming self._data contains the timedelta values
    elif isinstance(other, pd.Series) and is_datetime64_any_dtype(other.dtype):
        # If other is a Series with datetime data type, handle the subtraction accordingly
        return other - self._data  # Assuming self._data contains the timedelta values
    else:
        # For other types or unsupported operations, raise a TypeError
        raise TypeError("Unsupported operation for subtraction")
```

This corrected code checks for specific types of operands and performs the subtraction accordingly. If the operand is of a supported type, the subtraction is performed. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised to indicate an unsupported operation.
