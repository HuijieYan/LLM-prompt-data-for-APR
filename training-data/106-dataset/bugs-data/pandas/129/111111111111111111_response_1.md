The error is occurring in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeLikeArrayMixin` class. The error message indicates that it's happening when attempting to create a `DatetimeArray` from `other` inside the `__rsub__` method.

The possible reason for the bug is that the `__rsub__` method is trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from the `other` value, but the type of `other` is not compatible with the `DatetimeArray` constructor. It seems to be expecting a `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.

To fix the bug, the `__rsub__` method should be modified to ensure that the `other` value is of the correct type before trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from it. Additionally, error handling should be put in place to handle cases where the `other` value is not of the correct type.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # Your existing logic here...

        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
            raise ValueError("Unexpected type '{}'. 'other' must be a DatetimeArray ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those.")

        return other - self

    # Remaining code...
```

This corrected code ensures that the `other` value is of the correct type before trying to create a `DatetimeArray` from it, and raises an error if it's not of the correct type.
