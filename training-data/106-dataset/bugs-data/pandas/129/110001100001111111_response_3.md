The buggy function is designed to handle different types of input parameters (`self` and `other`) and make calculations based on their types and values. However, the function is throwing errors because of the incorrect handling of different data types and value comparisons.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the function checks for the data types and values of `self` and `other` and decides which operation to perform based on these comparisons.

The occurrences of the bug are due to incorrect handling of different data types and value comparisons within the function. For example, when comparing `self` and `other` with the `is_datetime64_any_dtype()` and `is_timedelta64_dtype()` methods, the function fails to account for all possible data type matches and comparisons.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle each comparison case separately by checking the data types and values, and then performing the necessary operations accordingly. This will ensure that all possible cases are accounted for, and the function does not throw errors based on incorrect comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        result = []
        for val in self:
            result.append(other - val)
        return result
    elif (is_datetime64_any_dtype(self.dtype) and isinstance(other, datetime) and not is_datetime64_any_dtype(pd.Series(other).dtype)):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {typ} from {cls}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, typ=type(other).__name__))
    elif is_period_dtype(self.dtype) and is_timedelta64_dtype(other):
        raise TypeError("cannot subtract {dtype} from {cls}".format(cls=type(self).__name__, dtype=other.dtype))
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            result = []
            for val in self:
                result.append(pd.Timedelta(days=-val.days))
            return result
        else:
            result = []
            for val in self:
                result.append(pd.Timedelta(days=val.days * -1))
            return result

    result = []
    for val in self:
        result.append(pd.Timedelta(days=-val.days))
    return result
```

This corrected code ensures that the function handles all possible data type matches and comparisons correctly, and performs the necessary operations based on the comparisons.
