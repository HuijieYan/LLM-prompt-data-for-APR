The error occurs in the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. This method is called when trying to subtract a `tdarr` object from the `ts` object in the test function. The error message suggests that the `DatetimeArray` class is not handling the input `other` correctly, and it expects an input of type `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series or Index containing one of those, rather than a simple `datetime64` type.

The bug likely occurs because the `DatetimeArray` class is expecting a different type of input (i.e., `DatetimeArray` ndarray, or Series or Index) while it's being passed a `datetime64` type directly.

To fix the bug, the `__rsub__` method of the `DatetimeArray` class should be updated to handle different types of input more gracefully without expecting a specific type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __rsub__(self, other):
    if is_datetime64_any_dtype(other) and is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        # ndarray[datetime64] cannot be subtracted from self, so
        # we need to wrap in DatetimeArray/Index and flip the operation
        if not isinstance(other, (DatetimeArray, pd.Series)):
            # Avoid down-casting DatetimeIndex
            from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

            other = DatetimeArray(other)
        return other - self
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(self.dtype):
        if lib.is_integer(other) or is_integer_dtype(other):
            # need to subtract before negating, since that flips freq
            # -self flips self.freq, messing up results
            return -(self - other)

        return (-self) + other

    return -(self - other)
```

This corrected code should handle different input types more gracefully and prevent the ValueError mentioned in the error message.
