The test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error` is intended to calculate the rolling correlation between a Series `s` and a rolling window of the same Series `s` with a window size of "12H". The expected result is a Series of NaN values due to the nature of the test.

The error message indicates a `MemoryError` that occurs due to the attempted memory allocation for an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64.

The potential error location seems to be within the `_get_corr` function, specifically when calculating the rolling covariance and standard deviations.

The bug likely occurs due to an inappropriate window size value being assigned to `window` within the `corr` function. The window size is set as a time string "12H" instead of an integer.

To fix this bug, the window size needs to be properly converted to an integer representing the number of time periods for the rolling window. Additionally, the calculation within the `_get_corr` function should be modified to utilize the correct window size value for calculating the rolling covariance and standard deviations.

The corrected code for the `corr` function is as follows:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        rolling_covariance = a.cov(b, **kwargs)
        rolling_std_a = a.std(**kwargs)
        rolling_std_b = b.std(**kwargs)

        return rolling_covariance / (rolling_std_a * rolling_std_b)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
