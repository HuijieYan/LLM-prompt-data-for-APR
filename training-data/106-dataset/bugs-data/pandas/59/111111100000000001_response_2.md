Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_get_window` function, which is being called inside the `corr` method. The `corr` method is trying to get the window using the `_get_window` method, which is not defined correctly.

Reasons behind the bug: The `_get_window` method has an incorrect signature for the `win_type` parameter, and it is also returning the wrong data type (`int` instead of `np.ndarray`). The `corr` method is using `_get_window` with the wrong signature and expecting the wrong return type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the signature of the `_get_window` method to match the expected type for the `win_type` parameter and the return type.
2. Update the `corr` method to call the corrected `_get_window` method and handle the returned data correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# updated _get_window signature
def _get_window(self, other=None, win_type: Optional[Union[str, Tuple]]=None) -> np.ndarray:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected corr method
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        
    # only default unset
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
    
        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
In this corrected code, the `_get_window` method has been updated to have the correct signature and return type. The `corr` method has been updated to use the corrected `_get_window` method.
