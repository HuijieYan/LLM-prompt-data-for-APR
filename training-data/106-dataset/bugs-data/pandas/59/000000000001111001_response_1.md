The potential error in the provided function is the calculation of the 'window' value. It seems that the 'window' variable is calculated incorrectly and should be an integer representing the time duration, but it is currently assigned a string value '12H' from the variable 'self.win_freq'.

The error occurs because the 'self.win_freq' variable is a string containing a frequency value ('12H') instead of an integer value that represents the time duration.

To fix this bug, we should convert the frequency value to an integer representing the time duration in nanoseconds, based on the time frequency provided.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )

def _get_window(self, other):
    # Convert frequency value to time duration
    freq_value = pd.to_timedelta(self.win_freq).value
    return freq_value

```

In this corrected code:
- A new '_get_window' method is added to calculate the time duration based on the frequency value.
- The 'window' variable in the 'corr' method is assigned the time duration calculated using the '_get_window' method.
