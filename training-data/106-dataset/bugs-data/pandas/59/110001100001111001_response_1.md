The error is likely occurring inside the `_get_window` method of the `Rolling` class, and possibly within the `corr` method of the same class. The `window` parameter seems to be a string instead of an integer, which is causing an error. 

The reason for this bug is that the `window` variable, which should represent the size of the moving window, is being set to the `self._get_window(other)` call. The `_get_window` method should return the window size as an integer, but it seems to be returning a string instead. This is likely due to a bug in the `_get_window` method itself.

To fix this bug, the `_get_window` method should be modified to return the window size as an integer, and the `corr` method should be updated to correctly handle the window size returned by `_get_window`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
    
        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

To fix the bug in the `_get_window` method, it needs to be updated to return the window size as an integer. Without knowing the exact implementation of the `_get_window` method, it's hard to provide a specific fix. But in general, the method should calculate and return the window size as an integer.
