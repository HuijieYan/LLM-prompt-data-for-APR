The code provided seems to be related to Pandas library and contains a method named `corr`. The bug seems to be related to the `window` variable within the `corr` method, as the `window` value is being received as a string. 

Since the expected behavior generally involves a numerical value for the window, it seems that the issue is related to retrieving the window length.

To fix this issue, the `_get_window` method should return a numerical value (such as an integer representing the window length) instead of a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise

        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)
        
        def _get_corr(a, b):
            a = a.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            b = b.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
        
            return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
        
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
``` 

In this corrected code, the problem of receiving a string value for `window` is addressed, since `self._get_window` is expected to return a numerical value representing the window length. Now the function should work appropriately, as it uses the expected numerical value for the window.
