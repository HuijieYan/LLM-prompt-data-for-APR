The error seems to be related to memory allocation, as the error message states "Unable to allocate 314 TiB for an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64."

The potential error location within the `corr` function is in the calculation of the correlation using `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))`. This calculation seems to be causing memory allocation issues.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the calculation is causing excessive memory allocation due to the large size of the arrays involved.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to optimize the calculation of the correlation to reduce memory usage. This could involve iterating through the rolling windows and calculating the correlation for smaller chunks of data.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
# Corrected corr function
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b, window):
        results = []
        for i in range(len(a) - window):
            window_a = a.iloc[i : i+window]
            window_b = b.iloc[i : i+window]
            result = window_a.cov(window_b, **kwargs) / (window_a.std(**kwargs) * window_b.std(**kwargs))
            results.append(result)
        return results

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, window, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the calculation of the correlation has been optimized by iterating through smaller chunks of data within the rolling window, which should help reduce memory usage.
