The issue here seems to be related to memory allocation error, specifically a `MemoryError` that occurs during the calculation of the correlation using rolling windows. The error is specifically related to the creation of an array with a very large shape (in this case, (43200000000000,)).

The root cause of this issue is the window parameter that is being passed to the `rolling` function. The window is currently being set as a string "12H", which is an invalid value to be directly passed to the `rolling` api. Additionally, the frequency window size is also being passed in nanoseconds. This results in the creation of a large array that exceeds the available memory size.

To resolve this issue, the "12H" window should be converted to an integer representing the window size in nanoseconds, and then passed to the `rolling` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    
    if isinstance(self.window, str):
        window, _ = to_offset(self.window)
        # convert to nanoseconds
        window = window.nanos
    else:
        window = self.window

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `window` is first checked to see if it's a string. If it is, it gets converted to nanoseconds, and then used as the window parameter for the `rolling` function. This change will prevent a `MemoryError` from occurring due to the window size exceeding the available memory.
