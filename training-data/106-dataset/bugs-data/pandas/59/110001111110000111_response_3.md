The test function `test_corr_freq_memory_error` tries to calculate the correlation of a Series with itself using the `rolling` method and a window of 12 hours. However, there is an error related to memory allocation, which indicates that the bug is likely due to the memory requirements of the function when using a large window size.

The potential error location is within the `corr` method in the `rolling.py` file, specifically in the `_get_corr` function. The error is likely due to the combination of a large window size and the calculation involving covariance and standard deviation, which results in excessive memory allocation.

The occurrence of the bug can be attributed to the way the `_get_corr` function is implemented, where it calculates the covariance and standard deviation of the rolling windows using a large window size, resulting in a huge memory allocation.

One approach to fixing the bug is to optimize the memory usage within the `_get_corr` function by re-evaluating the calculations involving covariance and standard deviation for large window sizes. It may involve using a different algorithm or approach to handle the calculations with reduced memory overhead.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method in the `rolling.py` file:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise

    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    a = self._selected_obj.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
    b = other.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        cov_values = a.cov(b, **kwargs)
        std_product = a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs)
        return cov_values / std_product

    return _flex_binary_moment(a, b, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise))
```

In this corrected code, the calculation of covariance and standard deviation is handled within the `corr` method itself, avoiding excessive memory allocation that was occurring previously. This should address the memory error related to the large window size and reduce the memory overhead.
