Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring within the `_get_corr` function, specifically within the `rolling` method of the series, as indicated by the error message related to memory allocation.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug might be caused by the `rolling` method trying to allocate a very large amount of memory when performing the correlation calculation, leading to a `MemoryError`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to optimize the memory usage within the `_get_corr` function. This could involve reducing the size of the rolling window or using a more memory-efficient algorithm for calculating the correlation.

Another approach could be to check for any potential memory leaks or inefficiencies within the `_get_corr` function that could be causing the excessive memory allocation.

Corrected Code:
```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = min(self._get_window(other), len(self._selected_obj), len(other._selected_obj))  # Limit window size to the length of the series

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        ).mean()  # Use mean or other memory-efficient aggregation function instead of cov
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        ).mean()

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the window size for the rolling operation is limited to the length of the series to prevent excessive memory allocation. Additionally, the aggregation function within the `_get_corr` function is changed to a more memory-efficient option, such as `mean`. These changes help to address the memory error issue when using the `rolling().corr()` method.
