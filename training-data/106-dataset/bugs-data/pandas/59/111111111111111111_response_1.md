The error occurs in the `corr` method of the `Rolling_and_Expanding` class in the `rolling.py` file. The error message indicates a `MemoryError` while attempting to allocate a large array for calculation.

The bug is occurring because the `window` value being passed to `a.rolling()` and `b.rolling()` inside the `_get_corr` function is incorrect. In the buggy implementation, the `window` is set as a string value `'12H'`, which is causing a MemoryError due to the large calculation required.

To fix this bug, the `self._get_window(other)` should return an integer value for the window size instead of a string. The window size should be calculated based on the frequency passed and the window type. The expected value for the `window` variable should be an integer representing the number of nanoseconds in 12 hours.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
    
        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `window` value is obtained from `self._get_window(other)` and used to calculate the rolling window for the calculations. This will avoid the MemoryError and provide the correct calculations for the `corr` method.
