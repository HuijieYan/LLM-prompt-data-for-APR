Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring within the _get_corr function where it's trying to allocate a large amount of memory for the array, resulting in a MemoryError.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the _get_corr function is trying to allocate a large amount of memory when calculating the correlation, likely due to the large size of the data.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Since the error occurred in pandas 1.0.1 but not in pandas 0.25.3, it might be related to a change in the implementation of the rolling() function in pandas.
2. One potential approach could be to optimize the memory allocation and calculation within the _get_corr function to handle larger datasets more efficiently.

Corrected Code:
```python
class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _get_corr function
    def _get_corr(self, a, b, **kwargs):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        cov = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        a_std = a_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
        b_std = b_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)

        return cov / (a_std * b_std)

    # corrected corr function
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        self.window = self._get_window(other)

        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise), **kwargs
        )
