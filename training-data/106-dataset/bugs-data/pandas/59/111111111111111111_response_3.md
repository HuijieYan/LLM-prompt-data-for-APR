Based on the error message from the test function and the provided details, it seems that the bug is occurring due to a memory error when using `srs1.rolling(pd.to_timedelta("12H")).corr(srs2)` with a large number of values. The bug is likely caused by how the `_get_corr` function is calculating the correlation. The error states that it is unable to allocate memory for an array with a very large shape.

The `_get_corr` function is calculating the correlation using rolling windows and applying functions like `cov` and `std` to the rolling windows. However, when the number of values is large, this process is consuming a significant amount of memory, leading to the memory error.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to optimize the implementation of the correlation calculation process within the `_get_corr` function. This could involve handling the large number of values more efficiently or finding a way to reduce the memory consumption.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_windowed = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_windowed = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        # Perform the rolling window correlation calculation directly
        return a_windowed.corr(b_windowed, pairwise=pairwise, **kwargs)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function directly uses the `.corr` method of the rolling windows `a_windowed` and `b_windowed` to calculate the correlation, instead of manually applying `cov` and `std` functions. This should provide a more memory-efficient approach to calculating the rolling window correlation.
