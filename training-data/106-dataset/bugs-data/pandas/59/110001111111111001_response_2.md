The error message indicates a MemoryError which is triggered by trying to allocate an excessively large amount of memory for an array in the code. This is likely related to the large window size used in the test case.

The potential error location is when the `window` value is being used for calculations. As per the analysis, the large window size of "12H" is causing memory allocation issues.

The issue is occurring due to the extremely large window size of "12H" which leads to an oversized array that triggers a MemoryError during the allocation phase.

To solve the issue, it is necessary to handle large window sizes more efficiently. This could involve implementing optimizations such as downsampling or using smaller window sizes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    if isinstance(self._get_window(self._selected_obj), str):
        window = self._get_window(self._selected_obj)
    else:
        window = self._get_window(self._selected_obj).ravel()[0]

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

This corrected code performs a check for the window size obtained from `self._get_window(self._selected_obj)`. If the window size is a string (as in the case of "12H"), it uses it as it is. However, if the window size is an array, it extracts the first element and uses that as the window size.

By making these changes, the code should now handle large window sizes more efficiently and avoid the memory allocation issues.
