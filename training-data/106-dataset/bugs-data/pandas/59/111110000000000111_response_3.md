The issue seems to be related to a memory error when using the `rolling().corr()` function for large datasets.

The potential error location is within the `_get_corr` function. It seems that the function is trying to allocate a large amount of memory to perform calculations, which leads to the memory error.

The bug occurred because the `_get_corr` function was trying to perform calculations on a very large dataset, leading to memory allocation issues. This could be due to the combination of the rolling window and the size of the input data.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_corr` function to handle large datasets more efficiently, or use a different approach to calculate the correlation between the rolling windows.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_roll = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_roll = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        a_cov = a_roll.cov(b_roll, **kwargs)
        a_std = a_roll.std(**kwargs)
        b_std = b_roll.std(**kwargs)

        return a_cov / (a_std * b_std)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now calculates the rolling covariance, rolling standard deviation for both series, and then returns the correlation. This approach is more memory-efficient and should help with the memory error for large datasets.
