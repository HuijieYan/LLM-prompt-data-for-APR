The error message indicates a MemoryError when attempting to allocate a large array, specifically with a shape of (43200000000000,). This suggests that the corr() calculation inside the _get_corr() function is causing the MemoryError due to excessive memory allocation.

The potential error location within the corr() function is the _get_corr() function, where the cov() and std() calculations are being performed on rolling window data.

The bug occurs because the calculations of cov() and std() inside the _get_corr() function result in excessive memory allocation, leading to a MemoryError. This is likely due to large window sizes being used for the rolling calculations in relation to the size of the input data.

To fix the bug, one approach is to reduce the window size used for the rolling calculations inside the _get_corr() function. This can help mitigate the excessive memory allocation that leads to the MemoryError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)
        
        def _get_corr(a, b):
            a = a.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            b = b.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            
            # Reduce the window size for the rolling calculations
            window_size = min(window, 100)  # Set a maximum window size of 100
            a = a.apply(lambda x: x[-window_size:])
            b = b.apply(lambda x: x[-window_size:])
            
            return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
        
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
