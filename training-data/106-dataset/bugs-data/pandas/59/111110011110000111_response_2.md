The error occurs when the `rolling` function is called with a frequency that is too high, leading to a `MemoryError` when trying to allocate memory for the result. The `rolling` function in this case is creating windows of a size that is causing a memory allocation issue.

The issue could be related to the `_get_corr` function within the `corr` method, where `a` and `b` are being calculated using the `rolling` function.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to limit the size of the rolling window to prevent excessive memory allocation. This can be achieved by adjusting the window size parameter passed to the `rolling` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    
    # Calculate window size based on the frequency of the data
    freq = other.index.freq
    if freq is not None:
        window_size = int(pd.to_timedelta("12H") / freq)  # Adjust as needed
        window = min(len(other), window_size)
    else:
        window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this correction, the window size is calculated based on the frequency of the data to limit the size of the rolling window and prevent excessive memory allocation. If the frequency information is not available, the previous approach can be used to get the window size from the `_get_window` method.
