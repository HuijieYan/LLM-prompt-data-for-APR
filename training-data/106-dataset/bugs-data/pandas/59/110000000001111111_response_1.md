The error in the provided `corr` function seems to be related to the `window` parameter not being correctly passed to the `a.rolling` and `b.rolling` methods. The `window` value is expected to be numerical, but it is currently of type `str`.

The bug is likely occurring because the code is trying to allocate an extremely large array due to an incorrect value being passed as the `window` parameter. This leads to a MemoryError, as the system is unable to allocate the required memory for the large array.

To fix this bug, the `window` value needs to be converted to an integer before being used in the `a.rolling` and `b.rolling` methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    window = pd.to_timedelta(window).nanoseconds  # Convert window to nanoseconds

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `window` is first converted to a `Timedelta` object using `pd.to_timedelta` and then converted to the number of nanoseconds using the `nanoseconds` attribute. This ensures that the `window` is of the appropriate numerical type before it is used in the `rolling` methods.
