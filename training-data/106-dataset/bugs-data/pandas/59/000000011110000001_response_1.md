1. The test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error` is trying to calculate the rolling correlation of a Series with a window size of 12 hours. However, it is encountering a `MemoryError` due to an inability to allocate a large amount of memory for the array created within the rolling correlation calculation process.

2. The potential error location within the `corr` function is in the calculation of the rolling correlation using the `_get_corr` function, specifically in the division by the product of the standard deviations.

3. The `MemoryError` is occurring because the rolling correlation is trying to allocate a massive amount of memory for the intermediate arrays created during the calculation of the correlation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reducing the size of the rolling window to minimize memory consumption.
   - Implementing a more memory-efficient method for calculating the rolling correlation.
   - Checking for and handling potential memory errors within the function.

5. Corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    # only default unset
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        # Applying a memory-efficient method for calculating correlation
        merged = pd.concat([a, b], axis=1).dropna()
        a_values = merged.iloc[:, 0]
        b_values = merged.iloc[:, 1]
        return a_values.corr(b_values)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now calculates the correlation using a memory-efficient approach by merging the rolling windows of 'a' and 'b' and then calculating the correlation between the merged values. This approach reduces the memory footprint and avoids the memory error encountered previously.
