The error occurs when the `.rolling().corr()` method is used with large datasets, resulting in a MemoryError due to the allocation of a large array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_corr` function where the `MemoryError` is being raised due to the allocation of a large array.

The cause of the bug is the calculation being performed on a large dataset which results in the allocation of a large array causing a MemoryError.

To fix the bug, one approach is to handle the large dataset by using a divide and conquer strategy to calculate the correlation in chunks rather than processing the entire dataset at once.

Another approach is to optimize the memory allocation and usage within the `_get_corr` function to prevent the MemoryError.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_corr` function:

```python
def _get_corr(a, b):
    chunk_size = 1000  # Define a chunk size
    result = np.empty(len(a))  # Create an empty array to hold the result
    for i in range(0, len(a), chunk_size):  # Iterate through the data in chunks
        a_chunk = a[i:i+chunk_size].rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_chunk = b[i:i+chunk_size].rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        result[i:i+chunk_size] = a_chunk.cov(b_chunk, **kwargs) / (a_chunk.std(**kwargs) * b_chunk.std(**kwargs))
    return result
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by breaking the data into smaller chunks and processing them independently to avoid large memory allocations, thereby preventing the MemoryError.
