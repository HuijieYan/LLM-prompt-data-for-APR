Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is that the 'pairwise' variable is being set based on the condition 'pairwise is None' after the 'other' variable is set. This means that the value of 'pairwise' is not considered when 'other' is set to a default value.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition for setting the 'pairwise' variable is not applied before setting the 'other' variable. As a result, the default value of 'pairwise' is only used when 'other' is set to its default value, and not when 'pairwise' is not provided as an argument.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The condition for setting the 'pairwise' variable should be applied before setting the 'other' variable so that the default value of 'pairwise' is used whenever it is not provided as an argument.

Corrected Code:
```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    # move the condition for setting pairwise here
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
