The error message indicates a MemoryError when attempting to allocate a large amount of memory for an array. This is likely due to the inefficient memory usage in the `_get_corr` function within the `corr` method. The `rolling` function is used to calculate the rolling window values of the series, which then leads to the creation of an array of shape (43200000000000,) that causes the MemoryError.

To fix this issue, we can optimize the memory usage in the `_get_corr` function by avoiding unnecessary large array allocations.

Here's the corrected `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_rolling = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        
        cov_ab = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        std_a = a_rolling.std(**kwargs)
        std_b = b_rolling.std(**kwargs)

        return cov_ab / (std_a * std_b)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected `corr` method, the rolling window values are stored in `a_rolling` and `b_rolling`, and the covariance and standard deviation calculations are made using these rolling objects. This should prevent the unnecessary creation of large arrays and avoid the MemoryError.
