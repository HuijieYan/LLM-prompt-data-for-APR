The bug in the given code is in the `_get_window` method. The code for `_get_window` is not provided, so it's difficult to identify the exact issue without knowing how this method is implemented. However, based on the error message and provided details, it seems that `_get_window` method is returning a string instead of an integer value for the `window` variable.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `_get_window` method to return an integer value, as expected by the `corr` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `corr` function using the assumption that `_get_window` returns an integer value:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = int(self._get_window(other))  # Convert the window value to integer

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

By converting the window value to an integer using `int`, we ensure that the window variable is of the correct type expected by the `rolling` method.
