The error is occurring in the `corr` method of the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. The `MemoryError` indicates that there is an attempt to allocate an excessively large amount of memory.

The issue seems to be related to the window size and how it is being handled within the `_get_corr` function. The window used for the rolling calculations is defined using a frequency string ("12H"), and this is leading to a very large window size when converted to nanoseconds. This large window size is causing a memory allocation error when attempting to process the rolling computations.

The bug can be fixed by changing the way the window size is defined and used within the `_get_corr` function. Instead of using a frequency string, a specific window size (in nanoseconds) can be directly specified. This will prevent the creation of an excessively large window and avoid the memory error.

The corrected code for the `corr` method is as follows:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
