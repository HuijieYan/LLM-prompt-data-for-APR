The error occurs in the `corr` function in the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. The issue seems to be related to memory allocation when calculating the correlation between two rolling windows.

The `_get_corr` function is used to calculate the correlation between the two Series objects within the rolling window. The memory error occurs because the rolling windows are too large when calculating the correlation.

One approach to fixing this issue is to reduce the size of the rolling windows. This can be achieved by modifying the `corr` function to use a smaller window size or by specifying a smaller window size when calling the `rolling` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, window=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        if window is None:
            window = self._get_window(other)
        else:
            window = window
    
        def _get_corr(a, b):
            a = a.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            b = b.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
    
            return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `corr` function now accepts an optional `window` parameter to specify the size of the rolling window. This allows the user to control the window size and potentially reduce the memory usage.
