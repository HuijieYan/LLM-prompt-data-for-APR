The issue in the given function is likely due to excessive memory usage, which causes a MemoryError. This may be happening because the window size used in the rolling correlation calculation is too large.

To fix this issue, the window size needs to be adjusted to a smaller value to prevent the excessive memory usage. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)

        def _get_corr(a, b):
            # Instead of using a large window size, reduce the window to avoid excessive memory usage
            a = a.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            b = b.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )

            return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

        # pass the minimum between the window size and a smaller limit to ensure better memory usage
        smaller_window = min(window, 100)
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise),
            window=smaller_window
        )
```

By reducing the window size to a smaller limit or minimum window size, the memory usage can be significantly reduced, potentially solving the MemoryError issue. The specific value for the smaller limit can be adjusted based on the actual requirements and available memory.
