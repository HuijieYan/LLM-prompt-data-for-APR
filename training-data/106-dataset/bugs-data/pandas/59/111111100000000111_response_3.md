Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the _get_corr function, which is called within the corr function. The issue is most likely related to memory allocation due to the large array sizes involved in the rolling correlation calculation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the rolling correlation calculation is attempting to allocate an extremely large amount of memory for the array, leading to a MemoryError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more memory-efficient calculation method for the rolling correlation.
2. Implement a way to handle large array sizes without causing a MemoryError.
3. Check for any memory leaks or inefficient memory usage within the _get_corr function.

Corrected code:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)  # Assuming the _get_window method has been corrected

        def _get_corr(a, b):
            a_rolling = a.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )
            b_rolling = b.rolling(
                window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
            )

            a_mean = a_rolling.mean()  # Using mean instead of covariance for a more memory-efficient calculation
            b_mean = b_rolling.mean()
            a_deviation = a_rolling - a_mean
            b_deviation = b_rolling - b_mean
            return (a_deviation * b_deviation).sum() / (a_rolling.std(**kwargs) * b_rolling.std(**kwargs))

        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
