The bug in the provided function lies in the `_get_corr` function. This section of the function attempts to perform a rolling window calculation by using the `rolling` method on the input data `a` and `b`. However, the `a` and `b` variables are Series objects, and the rolling operation is invalid in the context of the `_get_corr` function.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the rolling operation and instead perform the calculation directly on the input Series. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        return a.corr(b)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the `_get_corr` function, the `rolling` operations have been removed, and the `a.corr(b)` call has been added to calculate the correlation between the input Series. This modification ensures that the function performs the intended calculation without the need for rolling windows.
