The error "MemoryError" is likely occurring due to an incorrect calculation in the `corr` function. The code is attempting to allocate a huge amount of memory for an array which is much larger than expected.

To fix this issue, the most likely culprit is the calculation inside the `_get_corr` function. It is important to verify the computation of the correlation value. The calculation `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))` may be causing the MemoryError issue due to large array sizes being created during the computation.

A potential fix could be to check the values being passed to `a` and `b` and ensure that the calculations do not result in extremely large array sizes. This could involve checking the length of the time series and the window size being used, and adjusting the computation to avoid excessive memory allocation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        # Calculate the mean of a and b
        mean_a = a.mean(**kwargs)
        mean_b = b.mean(**kwargs)

        # Calculate the covariance of a and b
        cov_ab = (a * b).mean(**kwargs) - mean_a * mean_b

        # Calculate the standard deviation of a and b
        std_a = a.std(**kwargs)
        std_b = b.std(**kwargs)

        # Calculate the correlation using the covariance and standard deviations
        corr = cov_ab / (std_a * std_b)
        
        return corr
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

This corrected code aims to calculate the correlation in a more memory-efficient way, avoiding the creation of excessively large arrays. This should prevent the MemoryError issue and provide the correct calculations for the correlation.
