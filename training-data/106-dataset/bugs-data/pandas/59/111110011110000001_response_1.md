The test case "test_corr_freq_memory_error" creates a Series with 5 elements and then calls the corr method with a rolling window of 12 hours. The expected result is a Series filled with NaN values.

The error appears to be related to a memory allocation issue, specifically a "MemoryError" caused by an attempt to allocate an excessively large array.

The potential error location within the "corr" function is likely the division calculation:

```python
return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
```

The error occurs because when working with a rolling window of 12 hours, a very large array is being created to hold the intermediate results of the calculations, resulting in a "MemoryError".

To fix this issue, one approach could be to modify the calculation in the "_get_corr" function to use a more memory-efficient approach. This might involve breaking the calculation down into smaller, more manageable chunks and combining the results.

Here is the corrected code for the "corr" function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_rolling = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
    
        cov = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, **kwargs)
        a_std = a_rolling.std(**kwargs)
        b_std = b_rolling.std(**kwargs)
        
        return cov / (a_std * b_std)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the calculations for covariance, standard deviation, and the final correlation coefficient are performed within the "_get_corr" function using the rolling window approach to ensure memory efficiency. This should address the memory allocation issue while still achieving the desired result.
