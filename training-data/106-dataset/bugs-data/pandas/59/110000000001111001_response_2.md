The potential error in the given function is in the calculation of the window. The function "_get_window" seems to return a string value for the window, but it is later used as an integer in the "_get_corr" function.

The reason for the bug is that the window value is being passed as a string when it should be an integer for the rolling window calculation to work correctly.

To fix the bug, the window value should be converted to an integer before calling the "_get_corr" function. This can be done by modifying the "_get_window" method to return an integer value instead of a string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = int(self._get_window(other))  # Convert window to integer

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
