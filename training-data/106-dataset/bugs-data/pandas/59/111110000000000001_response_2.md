The potential error in the `corr` function is the `_get_corr` method. It is defined within the `corr` method instead of within the class, and it is missing the `self` parameter.

The `corr` function is trying to define the `_get_corr` method inside itself, which is not the correct way to define a method within a class in Python. Additionally, the `_get_corr` method is missing the `self` parameter, which is required for it to access the attributes and methods of the class.

To fix this bug, the `_get_corr` method should be defined within the class and include the `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _get_corr method
    def _get_corr(self, a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=self._get_window(a), min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=self._get_window(b), min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    # corrected corr function
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)

        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
```
