The error is occurring in the `corr` function within the `rolling.py` file. Specifically, the error is happening inside the `_get_corr` function where a memory allocation error is taking place. The error message indicates that it was unable to allocate such a large memory size for an array, which is causing the memory error.

The bug occurs because the `_get_corr` function is trying to perform calculations on very large arrays, leading to a MemoryError. This could be due to an incorrect calculation or handling of large arrays.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to optimize the code within `_get_corr` to handle the large arrays in a memory-efficient manner. This could involve re-evaluating the calculations and finding ways to reduce the memory usage, such as using streaming or chunking techniques for large datasets.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_rolling = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        
        # Only calculate for valid windows
        valid_windows = (a_rolling.count() == window) & (b_rolling.count() == window)
        
        a_valid = a[valid_windows]
        b_valid = b[valid_windows]

        return a_valid.cov(b_valid, **kwargs) / (a_valid.std(**kwargs) * b_valid.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now calculates the covariance and standard deviation for only valid windows, avoiding the memory error caused by massive arrays. This should address the memory allocation issue and prevent the previous error from occurring.
