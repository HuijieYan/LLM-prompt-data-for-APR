The error occurs in the `_get_corr` function within the `corr` method. The `_get_corr` function is not able to handle the Series input correctly and there is also a redundant definition of the `_get_corr` function in the `corr` method.

The `_get_corr` function is defined twice, once within the `corr` method and once within the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class. This causes confusion and the function is not being called correctly.

To fix this bug, we can remove the redundant definition of `_get_corr` from the `corr` method and fix the function signature of the `_get_corr` from the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_corr(self, a, b):
    a_rolling = a.rolling(window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
    b_rolling = b.rolling(window=self.window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
    return a_rolling.cov(b_rolling) / (a_rolling.std() * b_rolling.std())

class _Rolling_and_Expanding(_Rolling):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)
    
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, self._get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
```

By removing the redundant definition of the `_get_corr` function and defining it properly within the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class, we ensure that the correct function is called and the bug is fixed.
