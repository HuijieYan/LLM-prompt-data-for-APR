This bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `rolling` window argument in the `corr` method. The error message indicates a `MemoryError` due to an attempt to allocate a large amount of memory for an array with shape (43200000000000,). This suggests that the window size is being incorrectly interpreted, causing a massive memory allocation attempt.

To fix this bug, the `corr` method should correctly handle the `rolling` window argument and calculate the correlation using the appropriate window size.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window().window_size  # Get the window size from _get_window directly
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(ddof=1, **kwargs) * b.std(ddof=1, **kwargs))  # Calculate covariance and standard deviation with ddof=1

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code:
- The window size is obtained directly from the `_get_window` method, and the appropriate attribute for the window size is accessed to avoid incorrect interpretation of the window argument.
- When calculating covariance and standard deviation, the `ddof` parameter is explicitly set to 1 to avoid memory allocation errors from unnecessary large calculations.

These changes should address the memory error issue and ensure that the `corr` method correctly handles the rolling window argument.
