The potential error in the provided code is in the `corr` method. The issue seems to be with the `_get_corr` function being defined twice, once in the class `_Rolling_and_Expanding` and once outside the class. This would cause a conflict or override the previous definition.

The error occurred because the `_get_corr` function was defined both inside and outside the class, causing confusion to the interpreter about which function to use.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant definition of the `_get_corr` function and use the one defined within the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
    
        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
    
    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```
