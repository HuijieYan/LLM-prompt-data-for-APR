The provided error message in the test function indicates a MemoryError when using the `rolling().corr(other)` method. The error occurs when trying to allocate a large array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64.

The potential error location within the `corr` function is in the `_get_corr` nested function, specifically when calling `return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))`. This line involves computing the covariance and standard deviation, which may lead to memory allocation issues for large datasets.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the computation of covariance and standard deviation within the `_get_corr` function for large rolling windows results in excessive memory allocation.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the logic within the `_get_corr` function to handle large rolling windows without causing excessive memory allocation. This can be achieved by using vectorized operations and reducing the memory footprint of the calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a_roll = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b_roll = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        cov_values = a_roll.cov(b_roll, **kwargs)
        std_product = a_roll.std(**kwargs) * b_roll.std(**kwargs)
        divide_mask = std_product != 0  # Avoid division by zero
        result = np.full(len(a), np.nan)
        result[divide_mask] = cov_values[divide_mask] / std_product[divide_mask]

        return result

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function uses vectorized operations to calculate the covariance and standard deviation, and then performs the division with a mask to avoid division by zero. This approach reduces memory allocation and should resolve the MemoryError issue for large rolling windows.
