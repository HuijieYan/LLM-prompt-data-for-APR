The error message indicates a MemoryError, which means that the code is attempting to allocate an impractically large amount of memory, leading to a failure.

The potential error location is within the `_get_corr` function, particularly the `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))` line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely the incorrect computation of covariance, standard deviation, and division, which could be leading to an excessive memory allocation.

To fix this bug, the covariance and standard deviation calculation should be performed using proper handling of the rolling windows.

Here's the corrected version of the function `corr`:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        # only default unset
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b, window):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
        )

        return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, window=self.win_freq, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function takes an additional `window` parameter, and it is invoked by `_flex_binary_moment` with the correct window value (`self.win_freq`).

This approach should prevent excessive memory allocation errors and calculate the result correctly.
