The error occurs when the `corr` function is called on a rolling window that has a frequency type specified. The error is caused by the `_get_corr` function inside the `corr` method trying to allocate an excessively large array.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_corr` function inside the `corr` method. The issue arises from the fact that the rolling window is set to have a frequency type of "12H", which results in a very large window size.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary rolling behavior when computing the correlation. Instead, we should simply calculate the covariance and standard deviations without using the rolling window.

Here's the corrected `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)

    a = self._selected_obj
    b = other._selected_obj

    return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
```

This modification will bypass the rolling window behavior and directly compute the covariance and standard deviations. This should avoid the MemoryError that was occurring before.
