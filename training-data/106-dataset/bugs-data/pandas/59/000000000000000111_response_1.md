The potential error location within the function is the `_get_corr` function, specifically in the lines where `a` and `b` are being modified with the `rolling` function. This modification is causing memory allocation issues when running the code with a large dataset, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `rolling` function modifies the original Series, which can lead to excessive memory usage when operating on large datasets.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to create a new rolled Series without modifying the original Series. This can be achieved by using the `rolling` function with `closed='right'` parameter, which creates a new, non-overlapping, rolling window. Additionally, the `min_periods` and `center` parameters are set to the appropriate values to control the behavior of the rolling window.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b):
        a = a.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=1, closed='right'
        )
        b = b.rolling(
            window=window, min_periods=1, closed='right'
        )

        return a.corr(b, **kwargs)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `rolling` function is used with the `closed='right'` parameter to create new rolling windows without modifying the original Series. Additionally, the `min_periods` parameter is set to 1 to ensure that the correlation is calculated even for small windows, and the `center` parameter is not explicitly set, defaulting to `False`.
