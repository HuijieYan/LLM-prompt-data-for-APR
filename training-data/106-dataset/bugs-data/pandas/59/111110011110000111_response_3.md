1. The test case creates a Series with a range of 5 values with a frequency of 1, then attempts to calculate the rolling correlation using a window of "12H" on the same Series. This is likely to cause a memory error as the window size is exceedingly large compared to the number of elements in the Series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the rolling correlation using a very large time window.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the window size specified for the rolling correlation is too large, causing a MemoryError when trying to allocate memory for the array.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Handling large windows: Check the size of the window before calculating the rolling correlation, and if it exceeds a certain threshold, raise an error or use a smaller window size.
   b. Redefining the rolling correlation calculation: In cases where the window size is too large, use a different method for calculating the rolling correlation or adjust the parameters to reduce the memory usage.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)
        
        if window < pd.Timedelta("1D"):  # Checking if window size is smaller than 1 day
            def _get_corr(a, b):
                a = a.rolling(
                    window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
                )
                b = b.rolling(
                    window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center
                )
        
                return a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))
        
            return _flex_binary_moment(
                self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
            )
        else:
            raise ValueError("The specified window size is too large.")
