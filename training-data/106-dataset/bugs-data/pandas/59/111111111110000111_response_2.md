This bug is related to the memory error that occurs when running the test function `test_corr_freq_memory_error`. The error is caused by the `_get_corr` function in the `corr` method within the class `_Rolling_and_Expanding` in the file `rolling.py` under the `pandas.core.window` package.

The reason behind the bug is that an excessively large array is being created due to the calculations inside the `_get_corr` function, which leads to a MemoryError. This error occurs because the window being used in the rolling calculations is inadvertently causing the creation of a very large array, leading to memory allocation issues.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to revise the calculation inside the `_get_corr` function to avoid the creation of excessively large arrays. This can be achieved by adjusting the window size or by handling the window calculations in a different way.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)

    window = self._get_window(other, win_type='rolling')  # Provide the window type as 'rolling'

    def _get_corr(a, b, window_size):
        a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window_size, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window_size, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
        
        a_std = a_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
        b_std = b_rolling.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
        a_b_cov = a_rolling.cov(b_rolling, pairwise=pairwise, ddof=1, **kwargs)
        
        return a_b_cov / (a_std * b_std)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, window, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the window for the rolling calculation is obtained using the modified `_get_window` function, and the `_get_corr` function is updated to calculate the covariance and standard deviation directly within the rolling calculation, avoiding the creation of excessively large arrays.

This fix should address the memory error issue and provide the correct calculations for the `corr` function.
