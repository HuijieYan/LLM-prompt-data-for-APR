The buggy function `corr` is intended to calculate the rolling correlation between two Series objects. It uses the `_get_corr` function to retrieve the correlation value. However, the `_get_corr` function is defined inside the `corr` method, which can lead to potential bugs or inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the `_get_corr` function should be moved outside the `corr` method and become a separate function. This will ensure that the calculation of the correlation is done correctly.

Moreover, the `_get_window` method, responsible for obtaining the window size, should be leveraged to calculate the correlation correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `corr` method that incorporates these fixes:

```python
def _get_corr(a, b, window):
    a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
    b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

    return a.cov(b) / (a.std() * b.std())

def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
        pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)
    
    result = _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise), window=window
    )

    return result
```
