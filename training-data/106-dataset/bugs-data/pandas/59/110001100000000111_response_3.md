Analysis:
The issue seems related to memory allocation error when using the rolling correlation function on two large Series.

Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `corr` method within the `rolling.py` file. The `_get_corr` function is being used to calculate the rolling correlation, which in turn uses the `rolling` method to compute the rolling window. However, it appears that the method is not handling memory allocation efficiently, leading to the MemoryError.

Reason for Bug:
The bug seems to be due to inefficient memory allocation within the `_get_corr` function. It is likely that the rolling window size is too large, causing excessive memory usage.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a more efficient method for calculating the rolling correlation to reduce memory usage.
2. Optimize the memory allocation process within the `_get_corr` function to handle large rolling window sizes more effectively.
3. Consider using a different approach to compute the rolling correlation that does not lead to excessive memory allocation.

Corrected Code:
```python
    def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        
        window = self._get_window(other)  # Get the window size
        
        def _get_corr(a, b, window):  # Improved rolling correlation calculation
            a_rolling = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
            b_rolling = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
            
            return a_rolling.corr(b_rolling, pairwise=pairwise)
        
        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, window=window
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now directly uses the `rolling.corr` method to compute the rolling correlation, bypassing the need for calculating covariance and standard deviation separately. This should help in optimizing memory usage and addressing the MemoryError issue.
