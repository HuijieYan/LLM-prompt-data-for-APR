The error message "MemoryError: Unable to allocate 314. TiB for an array with shape (43200000000000,) and data type int64" indicates that there is a memory allocation issue, likely caused by the large size of the array being created. This is consistent with the test case `test_corr_freq_memory_error`, which is attempting to calculate the correlation of a rolling window with a frequency of 12 hours, resulting in a very large array.

The potential error location within the `corr` function is in the `_get_corr` function, where the rolling window is being applied to the Series. The calculation of `a.cov(b, **kwargs) / (a.std(**kwargs) * b.std(**kwargs))` within the `_get_corr` function could be leading to the creation of very large arrays, causing the memory allocation issue.

To fix this issue, a possible approach would be to modify the calculation within the `_get_corr` function to operate on smaller windows of data, rather than the entire Series. This can be achieved by breaking down the calculation into smaller chunks to avoid creating excessively large intermediate arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `corr` function:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
    if other is None:
        other = self._selected_obj
    # Default unset, defaulting to True
    pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise

    other = self._shallow_copy(other)
    window = self._get_window(other)

    def _get_corr(a, b, window):
        corr_values = []
        for i in range(0, len(a), window):  # Process data in smaller chunks
            window_a = a[i:i+window]
            window_b = b[i:i+window]
            window_corr = window_a.cov(window_b, **kwargs) / (window_a.std(**kwargs) * window_b.std(**kwargs))
            corr_values.append(window_corr)
        return pd.concat(corr_values)

    return _flex_binary_moment(
        self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, pairwise=bool(pairwise), window=window
    )
``` 

In this corrected code, the `_get_corr` function now processes the data in smaller chunks defined by the `window`. This should avoid creating excessively large arrays and resolve the memory allocation issue.
