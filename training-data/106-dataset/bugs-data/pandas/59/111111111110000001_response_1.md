1. The test case is trying to calculate the correlation of a Series with itself using a rolling window of "12H". The expected result is a Series of NaN values.

2. The potential error location is in the `corr` method within the `_Rolling_and_Expanding` class in the `rolling.py` file. The error occurs when trying to calculate the covariance and standard deviations of the rolling windows for the input Series in order to compute the correlation.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect usage of the methods for calculating covariance and standard deviation within the `corr` method. It seems that the window size required for the calculations is not being properly taken from the `other` input Series, leading to an unexpected memory allocation error during the operation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the window size for the rolling windows in the covariance and standard deviation calculations is obtained correctly from the `other` input Series.
   - Check the usage of the `cov` and `std` methods to ensure they are being called with the appropriate window size and other parameters.

5. Corrected code for the `corr` method:

```python
def corr(self, other=None, pairwise=None, **kwargs):
        if other is None:
            other = self._selected_obj
            # only default unset
            pairwise = True if pairwise is None else pairwise
        other = self._shallow_copy(other)
        window = self._get_window(other)

        def _get_corr(a, b, window):
            a = a.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)
            b = b.rolling(window=window, min_periods=self.min_periods, center=self.center)

            a_std = a.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
            b_std = b.std(ddof=1, **kwargs)
            a_cov_b = a.cov(b, pairwise=pairwise, ddof=1, **kwargs)

            return a_cov_b / (a_std * b_std)

        return _flex_binary_moment(
            self._selected_obj, other._selected_obj, _get_corr, window=window, pairwise=bool(pairwise)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `corr` method now ensures that the rolling window size is correctly used in the calculation of covariance and standard deviation for the input Series, and the proper parameters are passed to the `cov` and `std` methods.
