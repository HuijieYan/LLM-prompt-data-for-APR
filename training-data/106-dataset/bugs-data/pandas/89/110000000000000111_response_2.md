The GitHub issue title indicates that the bug occurs when using DataFrame.unstack() with a list of levels and a fill_value. The provided code for the _unstack_multiple() function seems to be related to this issue.

The bug appears to be happening in the section of code where unstacking is performed. The fill_value parameter is not being properly handled when unstacking with a list of levels, leading to incorrect results.

The issue is likely occurring because the code does not take into account the fill_value parameter when unstacking with a list of levels. This leads to the incorrect results and the discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the fill_value parameter when unstacking with a list of levels, ensuring that the fill_value is applied correctly to the unstacked data.

Here's the corrected code for the _unstack_multiple() function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the fill_value parameter is correctly passed to the unstack() method when unstacking with a list of levels. This should address the issue and ensure that the fill_value is applied correctly to the unstacked data.
