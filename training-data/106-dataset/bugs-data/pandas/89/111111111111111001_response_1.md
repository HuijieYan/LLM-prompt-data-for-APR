The issue seems to be related to the implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function which is used inside the `unstack` method. The error message shows that the values for the column "('score', 'female', False, 0)" are different.

Based on the provided code and error message, the potential error location is within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The bug likely occurred due to the incorrect implementation of the unstacking logic, especially when dealing with hierarchical columns and the creation of new columns and indices. The handling of MultiIndex and unstacking logic seems to be causing the mismatch in the results, leading to the failing test case.

To fix this, the unstacking logic needs to be revisited, especially the part where it handles hierarchical columns and constructs the new index and columns.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correction starts here

    # Unstack the DataFrame along the columns specified in clocs
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked  # Return the unstacked DataFrame
```

By simplifying the unstacking logic and directly using the `unstack` method of the DataFrame, we can avoid the complexities involved in creating a new index and columns. This approach should provide the expected unstacked output.
