The error message indicates a problem with the unstacking operation when using a list of levels and a fill_value in the DataFrame. The expected output of unstacking with a list of levels and a fill_value is not being achieved.

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, the potential error location seems to be within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the block where it deals with unstacking for a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns and a list of levels.

The bug seems to occur due to handling MultiIndex column unstacking incorrectly when a list of levels and a fill_value are provided. The incorrect handling leads to discrepancies in the expected and actual output.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to handle MultiIndex unstacking with list of levels and a fill_value properly.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        levels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        codes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        
        unstacked = data.copy()
        unstacked.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.columns)
        
        for level in levels:
            unstacked= unstacked.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
        
        # Rename columns with the new levels and names
        unstacked.columns.set_levels(levels, level=clocs, inplace=True)
        unstacked.columns.set_names(names, level=clocs, inplace=True)

    return unstacked
```

The modified function should handle unstacking correctly for MultiIndex columns with a list of levels and a fill_value provided. Applying this correction should lead to the expected output and resolve the issue with unstacking.
