The error message indicates that there is a difference in the values of the first column after unstacking, which suggests that the unstacking operation is not working as expected when a list of levels is provided.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for unstacking the DataFrame when a list of levels is provided.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the implementation of the logic for unstacking when a list of levels is provided. It seems that the fill_value is not being applied as expected when unstacking with a list of levels.

To fix the bug, the logic for unstacking with a list of levels needs to be modified to properly apply the fill_value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([dummy.index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs + clocs])

        unstacked = dummy.reindex(dummy_index, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
```

This corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function modifies the logic for unstacking the DataFrame with a list of levels to properly apply the fill_value, addressing the bug where the fill_value was being ignored.
