The error message indicates that when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, fill_value is being ignored.

After analyzing the provided code and test case, it appears that the bug is in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the handling of fill_value during the unstacking operation.

The reason for the bug is that the fill_value parameter is not being properly passed down the execution path and applied during unstacking.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fill_value parameter is correctly applied during the unstacking operation. This can be done by checking the specific conditions and handling them accordingly to ensure that fill_value is used as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for loc in clocs:
                result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)
            return result
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        # Rest of the code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the fill_value parameter is explicitly passed to the unstacking operation, ensuring that it is correctly applied during the process. This should resolve the issue where fill_value was being ignored.
