The error message indicates that the value 'nan' is not being replaced by the fill_value of 0 in the unstacked DataFrame. This suggests that the issue lies in the _unstack_multiple function, specifically in the section where the fill_value is applied.

The bug is occurring because the fill_value is not being handled correctly when unstacking the DataFrame with a list of levels. As a result, the fill_value is being ignored, leading to 'nan' values in the unstacked result.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the fill_value is properly applied when unstacking the DataFrame with a list of levels. This can be achieved by modifying the implementation of the _unstack_multiple function to handle the fill_value parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we directly use the unstack method on the DataFrame with the specified list of levels and fill_value. This should ensure that the fill_value is properly applied during the unstacking operation, addressing the bug.
