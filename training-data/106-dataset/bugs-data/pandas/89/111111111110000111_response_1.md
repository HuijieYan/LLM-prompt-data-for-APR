The error message shows that the function `df.unstack(["employed", "kids"], fill_value=0)` does not produce the expected output when compared with `df.unstack("employed", fill_value=0).unstack("kids", fill_value=0)` in the test case.

The bug is likely located in the `_unstack_multiple` function, where the unstacking process for multiple levels seems to have wrong behavior, causing the `fill_value` to be ignored.

The error occurred because the unstacking process for multiple levels is not correctly implemented. When unstacking with a list of levels, the `fill_value` provided is not properly applied, resulting in different behavior than expected.

To fix the bug, the unstacking logic for multiple levels should be revised to correctly apply the `fill_value` provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `unstack` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids] + clevels
    new_names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"] + cnames
    new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the process for unstacking with multiple levels has been modified to ensure that the `fill_value` is correctly applied during the unstacking operation.
