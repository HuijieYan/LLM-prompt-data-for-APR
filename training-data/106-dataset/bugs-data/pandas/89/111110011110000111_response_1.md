The error occurs in the `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` test function on the `assert_frame_equal` assertion. It compares the `result` and `expected` DataFrames and finds that the values of columns for the first row are different.

The potential error location is identified in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the processing of unstacking and handling the fill_value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, the `fill_value` is being ignored causing unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the unstacking and fill_value handling logic needs to be modified to ensure that the fill_value is properly applied to the unstacked DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

In this corrected function, we are directly using the `unstack` method of the `data` object with the specified `clocs` and `fill_value` without modifying index or handling any conditional logic. This will ensure that the `fill_value` is properly applied to the unstacked DataFrame.
