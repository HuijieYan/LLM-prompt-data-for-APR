The test case `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` is trying to test the unstacking of a multi-index DataFrame and comparing the expected and actual results using `tm.assert_frame_equal`. The error message indicates that the content of the columns in the DataFrames is different, specifically for the column name "('score', 'female', False, 0)".

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that handles unstacking for the MultiIndex DataFrame. The bug might be occurring due to incorrect manipulation or unstacking of the MultiIndex and its corresponding data.

The bug seems to be caused by improper handling of the unstacking process, especially when the MultiIndex structure is involved. It's likely that the bug is occurring while reconstructing the index and columns after unstacking.

To fix the bug, the logic related to unstacking and reconstructing the index and columns should be reviewed and possibly rewritten. Additionally, the method of assigning values to new_columns and unstacked should be checked for correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    indices = data.index.names
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(indices)
    return unstacked
```
