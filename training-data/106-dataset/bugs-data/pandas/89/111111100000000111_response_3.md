The provided test case involves using the `unstack` method on a DataFrame to unstack multiple levels of the index, and it specifies a `fill_value` to fill in missing values. However, the current implementation seems to ignore the `fill_value` parameter when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, leading to unexpected results.

The potential error location lies within the `_unstack_multiple` function, where the logic for unstacking with a list of levels may not handle the `fill_value` parameter correctly.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function doesn't properly handle the `fill_value` parameter when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. As a result, the `fill_value` is ignored and not applied during the unstacking operation.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to properly handle the `fill_value` parameter when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic related to handling the `fill_value` in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # existing code...
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        # existing code...
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        # existing code...

    # existing code...
    
    return unstacked
```

By incorporating the `fill_value` parameter correctly in the logic for unstacking within the `_unstack_multiple` function, the bug related to the `fill_value` being ignored when unstacking with a list of levels should be fixed.
