The bug occurs due to incorrect indexing and unstacking operations in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function attempts to unstack a multi-index DataFrame but encounters issues with hierarchical columns.

The potential error locations in the code are the operations related to rebuilding the DataFrame index and unstacking the DataFrame based on the specified columns.

To fix the bug, the index and unstack operations need to be performed correctly, ensuring that the multi-level indexing is handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    new_data = data.unstack(level=clocs)
    new_data = new_data.reindex(rlevels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return new_data
```

This corrected code ensures that the multi-index hierarchy is preserved and the unstacking operation is performed correctly, addressing the issues observed in the original function.
