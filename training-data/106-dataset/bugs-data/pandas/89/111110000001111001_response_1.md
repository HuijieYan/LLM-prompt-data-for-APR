The given function is a bit difficult to isolate the exact issue, but it looks like the problem is occurring in the 'for' loop where 'val' is assigned 'clocs[i]' and then 'result' is unstacked with 'val' as the argument. However, 'clocs' is also being modified inside the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this, create a new variable to hold the modified 'clocs' and use that variable inside the loop, instead of modifying the original 'clocs'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        clocs_updated = clocs
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs_updated[i]
            result = result.unstack(val)
            clocs_updated = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs_updated]

        return result

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the function should work as expected and no longer modify 'clocs' unintentionally.
