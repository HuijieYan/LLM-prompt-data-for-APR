The given test case `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` aims to test the unstacking of a multi-index DataFrame. The test sets up a DataFrame with multi-level index columns and then attempts to unstack the DataFrame using specific columns and filling any missing values with 0.

The error message is "DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] (column name="('score', 'female', False, 0)") values are different (50.0 %)", which indicates that there is a problem with the unstacking operation for the specified columns.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function, the method `_unstack_multiple` has several issues:

1. The `_unstack_multiple` function performs various operations without handling hierarchical columns correctly.
2. It contains complex logic to handle unstacking, especially for the MultiIndex case.

The bug is occurring because the `_unstack_multiple` function is not correctly unstacking the multi-level index columns, leading to incorrect values in the resulting DataFrame.

To fix this, the complex logic for handling the unstacking of hierarchical columns should be revised. Additionally, the implementation should be robust enough to correctly handle the unstacking of multi-level indexes, especially in the presence of missing values. A simpler and more intuitive method of handling unstacking should be adopted.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Unstack the data using the specified columns and fill any missing values with the provided fill value
    unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked_data
```

This revised implementation simplifies the logic and leverages the `unstack` method directly, which offers a cleaner and more reliable way to accomplish the unstacking process for multi-index DataFrames.
