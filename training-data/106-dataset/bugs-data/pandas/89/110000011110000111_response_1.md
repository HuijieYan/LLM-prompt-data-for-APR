The test function `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` is used to test the unstacking of a MultiIndex DataFrame with some specific values. The error message states that the DataFrame's first column values are different.

The potential error location is within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the section where `unstacked` is assigned, and the new columns are set. This is where the incorrect results are being produced.

The bug occurs due to an issue in handling the fill value option when unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It seems that the fill value is being ignored when unstacking with a list of levels.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fill value is properly taken into account when performing the unstack operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged after this point

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, we modify the unstack operation to use the `clocs` and `fill_value` provided directly. This change ensures that the fill value is properly applied during the unstack operation and should resolve the issue.
