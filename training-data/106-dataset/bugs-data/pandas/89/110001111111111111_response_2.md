The error occurs when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex, fill_value is ignored. The expected output is different due to this issue.

The potential error is in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function fails to correctly unstack the DataFrame when it already has a MultiIndex.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the DataFrame already has a MultiIndex, resulting in the filling value being ignored.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the DataFrame already has a MultiIndex and correctly unstack the DataFrame with the specified fill value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code will handle unstacking the DataFrame with the specified fill value, even when the DataFrame already has a MultiIndex. By directly using the `unstack` method on the DataFrame, it will correctly unstack the DataFrame with the fill value applied.
