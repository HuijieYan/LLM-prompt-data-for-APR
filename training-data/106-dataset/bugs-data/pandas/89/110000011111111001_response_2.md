The error occurs in the test function `test_unstacking_multi_index_df` at the `assert_frame_equal` statement. The error message indicates a difference between the expected and actual DataFrame column values.

The potential error location within the provided function is the unstacking step. It seems that there is an issue with the unstacking logic or the handling of NaN values.

The bug occurs because the unstacking process is not being handled correctly for the provided input DataFrame. This results in the incorrect values being populated in the unstacked DataFrame, leading to a mismatch with the expected DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the unstacking process should be revised to properly handle NaN values and ensure the correct reshaping of the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [data.index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [data.index.get_level_values(i) for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    for level in rlevels:
        unstacked = unstacked.reorder_levels(level, axis=1)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function uses the `get_level_values` method to obtain the levels for both the `clocs` and non-`clocs` indices. It then leverages the `unstack` method to perform the unstacking process and later uses `reorder_levels` to rearrange the levels as needed. This revised approach should address the issues with unstacking and handle NaN values appropriately.
