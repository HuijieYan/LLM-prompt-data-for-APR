Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the code is in the section where it checks for the data type (Series or not) and then performs different operations accordingly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug may be occurring due to inconsistent handling of the data type and different code paths based on the data type. This inconsistency might be leading to unexpected results or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of the data type, regardless of whether it is a Series or not.
2. Simplify the code by removing unnecessary condition checks and code paths specific to different data types.
3. Check for edge cases and handle them appropriately to prevent unexpected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
