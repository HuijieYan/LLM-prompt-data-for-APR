The error message "DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] (column name="('score', 'female', False, 0)") values are different (50.0 %)" indicates that the unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex is not producing the expected results.

The potential error is in the "_unstack_multiple" function, particularly in the section where the unstacking is being performed. It appears that the fill_value argument is not being handled properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has columns MultiIndex, the fill_value is being ignored due to the way the unstacking is implemented.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the fill_value is properly passed and handled during unstacking. This may involve modifying the logic for unstacking and verifying the handling of fill_value.

Below is the corrected code for the "_unstack_multiple" function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the unstacking operation is handled differently to ensure that the fill_value is properly applied when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. This should fix the bug related to unstacking ignoring the fill_value.
