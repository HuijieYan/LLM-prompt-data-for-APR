The error message is indicating that there is a difference in the values of the column "('score', 'female', False, 0)" between the expected and the actual result.

The potential error location in the function is likely related to the logic for unstacking and reshaping the DataFrame, especially where the MultiIndex columns are being manipulated.

The reason behind the bug could be incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns during unstacking, which could result in unexpected reshaping and data discrepancies.

To fix the bug, the unstacking and reshaping logic needs to be carefully reviewed and the correct approach for handling MultiIndex columns during unstacking should be implemented.

The corrected code for the problematic function can be as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[::-1], fill_value=fill_value).stack()

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic for unstacking the DataFrame using the `unstack` method and preserves the data integrity.
