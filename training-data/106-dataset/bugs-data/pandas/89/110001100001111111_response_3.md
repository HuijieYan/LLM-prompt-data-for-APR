The issue seems to be with unstacking a DataFrame with a list of levels, where the fill_value is being ignored. The bug is likely occurring within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle hierarchical columns yet. It also incorrectly sets the "dummy_index" if "rlocs" is an empty list. Moreover, there are several checks and alterations that take place based on certain conditions, resulting in erroneous behavior.

To fix the bug, it's important to properly handle hierarchical columns, ensure that the "dummy_index" is set correctly, and refactor the conditional checks to provide the correct outcome based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(data.index.levels[clocs[0]], name='__placeholder__')
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels[rlocs] + [index.levels[clocs[-1]]],
            codes=index.codes[rlocs] + [index.codes[clocs[-1]]],
            names=index.names[rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [index.levels[c] for c in clocs]
        new_names = [index.names[c] for c in clocs]
        new_codes = index.codes[clocs]

    else:
        clevels = [index.levels[c] for c in clocs]
        ccodes = [index.codes[c] for c in clocs]
        cnames = [index.names[c] for c in clocs]

        result = data
        for i, val in enumerate(clocs):
            result = result.unstack(i)
        
        dummy = result.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [index.names[-1]] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[-1]] + ccodes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
