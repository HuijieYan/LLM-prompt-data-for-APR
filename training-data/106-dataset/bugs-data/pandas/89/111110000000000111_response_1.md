Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the nested `if` statements that check the type of the input `data` and the presence of MultiIndex columns.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the index when unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has a columns MultiIndex. This is causing the `fill_value` to be ignored.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the input `data` and handle the unstacking process accordingly.
2. Ensure that the `fill_value` is properly passed to the unstacked result.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Code to handle unstacking with a list of levels on a DataFrame that already has MultiIndex columns
    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
