The function 'str_repeat' takes a list of integers 'repeats' and a Series 'arr' as input and replicates each string in the Series 'arr' based on the corresponding number in the 'repeats' list. The bug in the function is resulting from the use of the 'bytes.__mul__' and 'str.__mul__' functions, which are incorrect for replicating strings in this context. Additionally, the function '_na_map' is not defined and appears to be intended for null value handling.

To fix the bug in the function, we can replace the use of 'bytes.__mul__' and 'str.__mul__' with the pythonic way of repeating strings using '*' operator. Furthermore, we can handle null values by using the apply method along with a lambda function to replicate the strings rather than introducing the undefined '_na_map' function. 

Here's the corrected 'str_repeat' function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    if isinstance(repeats, int):
        return arr.apply(lambda x: x * repeats if pd.notna(x) else x)
    else:
        return arr.apply(lambda x, r: x * r if pd.notna(x) else x, r=repeats)

# Testing the corrected function with the provided test cases
s = pd.Series(['a', pd.NA])
print(str_repeat(s, 2))
print(str_repeat(s, [1, 2]))
```

This corrected function handles both single integer and sequence of integers for replicating the strings in the Series, and it correctly accounts for null values.
