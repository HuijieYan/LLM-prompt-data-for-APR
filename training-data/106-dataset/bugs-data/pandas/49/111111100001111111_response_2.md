The error is occurring in the `str_repeat` function when `repeats` is a sequence (list) rather than a scalar value. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the sequence of repeats correctly, leading to a TypeError when trying to repeat strings in the series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `str_repeat` function to correctly handle the sequence of repeats. This can be achieved by checking if `repeats` is a scalar or a sequence, and then applying the appropriate logic for repeating the strings in the series.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    if is_scalar(repeats):
        def scalar_rep(x):
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, repeats)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, repeats)
        return arr.map(scalar_rep)

    else:
        def rep(x, r):
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, r)
        
        result = arr.map(lambda x: [rep(x, r) for r in repeats])
        return result
```

With this corrected code, the `str_repeat` function can handle both scalar and sequence values for `repeats` and correctly repeat the strings in the series accordingly. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
