The error occurs in the function str_repeat when it tries to multiply a string by a number. When the input repeats includes None, there's no explicit handling for this case when computing the repeated string. This leads to a TypeError when trying to multiply a string by None.

The bug can be fixed by adding a conditional check to handle the case when repeats includes None explicitly. This can be done by checking if the current repeat value is None, and if so, returning None as the result for that particular index.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function.

```python
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    if is_scalar(repeats):

        def scalar_rep(x):
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, repeats)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, repeats)

        return _na_map(scalar_rep, arr, dtype=str)
    else:
        def rep(x, r):
            if r is None:
                return None
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, r)

        repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
        result = libops.vec_binop(np.asarray(arr), repeats, rep)
        return result
```

The added conditional check in the rep function ensures that if the repeat value is None, the result for that index is set to None.
