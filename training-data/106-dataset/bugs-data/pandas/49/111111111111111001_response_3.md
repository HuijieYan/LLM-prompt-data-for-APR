The provided error message is from the test function `test_repeat_with_null`. The error occurs when the function `rep` is called and is unable to handle the case where `arr` contains a missing value (NA). This means that the `rep` function needs to be modified to handle missing values appropriately.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `rep` function. This function is currently not equipped to handle the case where `arr` contains a missing value (NA). 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `rep` function does not have a conditional to check for missing values before applying the multiplication operation. As a result, it throws a TypeError when it encounters a missing value.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `rep` function to first check if the input `x` is a missing value (NA) before proceeding with the multiplication operation. If `x` is a missing value, the function should return a missing value; otherwise, it should apply the multiplication operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    if is_scalar(repeats):

        def scalar_rep(x):
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, repeats)
            except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                return str.__mul__(x, repeats)

        return _na_map(scalar_rep, arr, dtype=str)
    else:

        def rep(x, r):
            if pd.isna(x):
                return np.nan
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
            except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                return str.__mul__(x, r)

        repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
        result = libops.vec_binop(np.asarray(arr), repeats, rep)
        return result
```

In the corrected code, the `rep` function now includes a check for missing values before applying the multiplication operation. If `x` is a missing value, the function returns a missing value. Otherwise, it proceeds with the multiplication operation as before. This modification ensures that the function can handle missing values appropriately and should resolve the TypeError encountered in the test case.
