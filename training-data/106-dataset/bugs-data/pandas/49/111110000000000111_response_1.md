The error occurs when trying to repeat the strings in the Series when the `repeats` parameter is a sequence. This is due to the fact that the function is not handling missing values (NAType) correctly when `repeats` is a sequence.

To fix this, we need to update the code in the `str_repeat` function to handle missing values properly when `repeats` is a sequence.

The problematic section of the code is within the `str_repeat` function, specifically the else block where `repeats` is not a scalar.

The bug occurs because when `repeats` is a sequence, the function fails to handle the case where the string value is missing (NAType). It tries to repeat a missing value, which results in an error.

To solve this issue, we need to modify the function to handle missing values appropriately when `repeats` is a sequence.

The corrected function for `str_repeat` is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar
import pandas._libs.ops as libops
from pandas._libs.lib import values_from_object

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    if is_scalar(repeats):
        
        def scalar_rep(x):
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, repeats)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, repeats)

        return _na_map(scalar_rep, arr, dtype=str)
    else:
        def rep(x, r):
            if pd.isna(x):
                return x
            try:
                return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
            except TypeError:
                return str.__mul__(x, r)

        repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
        result = libops.vec_binop(values_from_object(arr), repeats, rep)
        return pd.Series(result, dtype='string')
```

In the corrected function, a check for missing values (NAType) is added inside the `rep` function that handles the repeating of string values when `repeats` is a sequence. If the value is missing, it returns the missing value directly. Additionally, the result is converted to a Series with string dtype to match the expected output.
