The provided `str_repeat` function has a bug that causes it to fail when a sequence of repeats is provided and one of the values in the series is `<NA>`. The error message indicates that the function is trying to use the `__mul__` method for bytes or strings on a `NAType`, which causes a `TypeError`.

The bug is occurring in the `str_repeat` function when it tries to handle `NATypes` in the series.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the `NATypes` in the series when a sequence of repeats is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    def rep(x, r):
        if pd.isna(x):
            return x  # If the value is NA, return NA without applying repetition
        try:
            return str.__mul__(x, r)
        except TypeError:
            return np.nan  # If an error occurs during multiplication, return NaN

    repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
    result = libops.vec_binop(np.asarray(arr), repeats, rep)
    return result
```

With this correction, the `str_repeat` function should now handle the `NATypes` in the series when a sequence of repeats is provided, and the test case provided should pass without any errors.
