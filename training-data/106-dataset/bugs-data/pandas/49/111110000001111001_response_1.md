The issue with the current `str_repeat` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `repeats` is a sequence (list) of integers. The function is not implemented to handle all the different values in the sequence.

The bug lies in the section of the code where the function checks if `repeats` is scalar or not. When `repeats` is not scalar, the function tries to use the `libops.vec_binop` function which might not be the correct approach.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the sequence of integers properly. We can iterate over the array and for each element, repeat the string according to the value of repeats. Then, we concatenate the results and return the Series.

Here's the corrected `str_repeat` function:

```python
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    if isinstance(repeats, int):
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        repeated_values = []
        for val, repeat_count in zip(arr, repeats):
            if pd.notna(val):
                repeated_values.append(val * repeat_count)
            else:
                repeated_values.append(np.nan)
        return pd.Series(repeated_values, dtype="object")
```

In this corrected function, if the `repeats` parameter is an integer, we use the built-in `repeat` function to repeat the strings. Otherwise, we iterate over the array and repeat each element according to the corresponding value in the `repeats` list, and store the results in a list. Then, we create a new Series from this list and return it.
