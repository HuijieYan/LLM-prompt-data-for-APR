The error occurs in the function `str_repeat` when the input parameter `repeats` is a sequence. The problem arises due to the use of the `bytes.__mul__` and `str.__mul__` functions, which are not compatible with the 'NAType' received for missing values.

To fix this bug, the `str_repeat` function should handle the case when `repeats` is a sequence and properly account for missing values. The function should use a conditional statement to check for missing values and only perform the multiplication operation for non-missing values.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_repeat` function:

```python
def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    if isinstance(repeats, int):
        # Handle single int repeats string in Series
        return arr.str.repeat(repeats)
    else:
        # Handle sequence of int repeats corresponding string in Series
        result = arr.copy()
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if pd.isna(arr[i]):
                continue  # Skip missing values
            else:
                result[i] = arr[i] * repeats[i]  # Repeat the string accordingly
        return result
```

This corrected implementation checks the type of `repeats` and handles the scenarios for both single and sequence inputs. It properly skips missing values and only performs the multiplication operation on non-missing values.
