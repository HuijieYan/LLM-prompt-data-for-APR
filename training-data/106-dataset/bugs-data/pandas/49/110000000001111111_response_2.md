The issue is occurring in the `str_repeat` function. It seems that there is an inconsistency in how NA values are handled when `repeats` is a sequence.

The bug occurs because when `repeats` is a sequence, the function fails to handle NA values properly and results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `str_repeat` function to handle NA values correctly when `repeats` is a sequence.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def str_repeat(arr, repeats):
    """
    Duplicate each string in the Series or Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repeats : int or sequence of int
        Same value for all (int) or different value per (sequence).

    Returns
    -------
    Series or Index of object
        Series or Index of repeated string objects specified by
        input parameter repeats.
    """
    def rep(x, r):
        if pd.isna(x):
            return x
        try:
            return bytes.__mul__(x, r)
        except TypeError:
            return str.__mul__(x, r)

    repeats = np.asarray(repeats, dtype=object)
    result = np.array([rep(x, r) for x, r in zip(arr, repeats)])
    return pd.Series(result)
```

This corrected function ensures that it handles NA values properly when `repeats` is a sequence, preventing the TypeError that occurred in the buggy function.
