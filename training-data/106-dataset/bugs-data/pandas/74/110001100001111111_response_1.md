The bug is likely to be located in the current implementation of the __new__ method. It seems that the bug occurs when the input parameter 'data' is expected to be of type 'TimedeltaArray' but is not properly handled.

The bug can occur because the data parameter is checked for being a scalar value and an instance of TimedeltaArray, but other possibilities are not appropriately handled. Additionally, the TimedeltaArray._from_sequence method should be used before calling cls._simple_new.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the cases where 'data' is neither a scalar nor a TimedeltaArray instance. In order to adhere to the expected behavior, we should utilize the method TimedeltaArray._from_sequence to create a TimedeltaArray from the 'data' input parameter. Then, we can call cls._simple_new with the created TimedeltaArray and the given name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Handle other cases
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
