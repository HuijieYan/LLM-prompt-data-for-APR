The potential error in the problematic function is that it does not handle the case where `data` is a TimedeltaArray and `freq` is not None. The function only checks for the condition where `data` is a TimedeltaArray and `freq` is None, and it returns a new TimedeltaArray. However, when `freq` is not None, the code does not handle this case, and it should create a new TimedeltaArray with the specified frequency.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to handle the case where `data` is a TimedeltaArray and `freq` is not None. We can utilize the `_from_sequence` method in this case and return a new TimedeltaArray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    if freq is not None:  # handle the case where data is a TimedeltaArray and freq is not None
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
    # handle the default case
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
