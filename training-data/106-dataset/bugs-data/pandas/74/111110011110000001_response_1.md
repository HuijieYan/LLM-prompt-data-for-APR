The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected when the test case `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")` was executed.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` function is likely in the logic that checks the mismatch between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the passed frequency. This logic is likely not raising the expected `ValueError` when the frequencies do not match.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic to check for frequency mismatch is not working as intended, causing the function to not raise the `ValueError` when it should.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to review and modify the logic for checking frequency mismatch, ensuring that it correctly raises a `ValueError` when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The corrected code for the `TimedeltaIndex` function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )
