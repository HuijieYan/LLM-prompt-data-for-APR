Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the __new__ method of the TimedeltaIndex class.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of the _simple_new method within the __new__ method. The _simple_new method is not being used correctly within the __new__ method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use the _simple_new method correctly within the __new__ method, passing the required parameters. Additionally, we need to handle other edge cases and error conditions within the __new__ method.

Corrected Code:
```python
    def __new__(
        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,
        closed=None,
        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )
    
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(values=data, name=name, freq=freq, dtype=dtype)  # Use _simple_new method correctly
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
    
        # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(values=tdarr, name=name, freq=freq, dtype=dtype)  # Use _simple_new method correctly
