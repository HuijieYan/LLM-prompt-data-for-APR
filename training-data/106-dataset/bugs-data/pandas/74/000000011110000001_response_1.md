The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when `tdi._data` is passed with `freq="D"`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` instances when `freq` is not specified.

The bug is occurring because the `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` instances are not handling the `freq` parameter properly, leading to the incorrect behavior and failure to raise a `ValueError` in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` instances with respect to the `freq` parameter.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex):
        if freq is not None and name is None:
            return cls._simple_new(data._data, name=None, freq=freq)
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
