Based on the error message, the bug seems to be related to the `TimedeltaIndex` function when called with the `tdi._data` and `freq="D"` parameters.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of frequency inference. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, the frequency inference logic in the `TimedeltaIndex` function needs to be reviewed. The frequency inference should be consistent with the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `TimedeltaIndex` function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    inferred_freq = getattr(data, "inferred_freq", None)
    if inferred_freq and inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency '{inferred_freq}' from passed values does not conform to passed frequency '{freq}'"
        )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
