Focusing on the error message and test case, it seems that there is an issue with the 'TimedeltaIndex' constructor when the 'freq' parameter is passed. The error message indicates that the 'Inferred frequency' does not conform to the passed frequency. This might be due to the incorrect handling of the frequency parameter within the '__new__' function of the 'TimedeltaIndex' class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the 'unit' input parameter and the assignment of the 'freq' parameter.

The bug might have occurred because the 'unit' parameter is being used instead of the 'freq' parameter. This could lead to incorrect handling of frequency values and mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

To fix the bug, we should replace the usage of the 'unit' parameter with the 'freq' parameter and remove any dependencies on the 'unit' parameter since it's causing the incorrect frequency handling. We also need to ensure that the correct 'freq' value is assigned and used throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    freq=None,  # Replace 'unit' with 'freq'
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if freq in {"Y", "y", "M"}:  # Check against 'freq' parameter instead of 'unit'
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, dtype=dtype, copy=copy  # Use 'freq' instead of 'unit'
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)  # Pass 'freq' to _simple_new
```
In the corrected code, the 'unit' parameter has been replaced with 'freq' and is used consistently throughout the function. This should address the frequency mismatch issue.
