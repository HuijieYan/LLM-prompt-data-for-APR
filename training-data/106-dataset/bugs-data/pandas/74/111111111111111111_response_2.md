The bug seems to be in the implementation of the TimedeltaIndex class. The error message suggests that when calling TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D"), it fails to raise a ValueError when it is expected to. This indicates that the implementation of the __new__ method in the TimedeltaIndex class is not handling the case where the frequency of the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

The potential error location is within the __new__ method of the TimedeltaIndex class, particularly in the conditional checks for the frequency mismatch.

The potential reasons behind this bug could be:
1. Mishandling of the frequency parameter and its comparison with the frequency inferred from the passed values.
2. Incorrect conditional checks and handling for the frequency mismatch error.

To fix the bug, the __new__ method in the TimedeltaIndex class needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where the frequency of the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This can be achieved by properly comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency and raising a ValueError if they do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method in the TimedeltaIndex class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    inferred_freq = tdarr.inferred_freq
    if inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency '{inferred_freq}' from passed values does not conform to passed frequency '{freq}'"
        )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
In the corrected code, after creating the TimeDeltaArray tdarr from the passed data, it compares the inferred_freq with freq and raises a ValueError if they do not match, providing a detailed error message indicating the mismatch.
