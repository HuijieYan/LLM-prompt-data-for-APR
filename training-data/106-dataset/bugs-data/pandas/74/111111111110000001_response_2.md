The test case `test_infer_from_tdi_mismatch` is designed to check whether the correct ValueError is raised when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the specified frequency.

The error occurs when `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")` is called, and it fails to raise the expected ValueError.

The potential error lies in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. It seems that the `_simple_new` method is not being called correctly, and this could be causing the failure to raise the expected ValueError.

The bug occurs because the condition to handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaIndex` and `freq` is specified is not properly handled in the `__new__` method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method to correctly handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaIndex` to ensure that the `_simple_new` method is called with the appropriate parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # The corrected part for handling TimedeltaIndex
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None:
        if name is None:
            name = data.name
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data._data, name=name, freq=freq)

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, I added a new condition to handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaIndex` and `freq` is specified. If this condition is met, it calls the `_simple_new` method with the correct parameters, including `data._data` as the data and `name` and `freq` as specified. This should fix the bug and ensure that the ValueError is raised as expected in the test case.
