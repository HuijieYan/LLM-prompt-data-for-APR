The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block that checks if the input data is an instance of TimedeltaArray.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is attempting to check if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` using the `isinstance` function. However, it's encountering an unexpected behavior, likely due to incorrect data types or attributes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if data is not None and not isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, I modified the check for `data` to verify if it's not None and if it's not an instance of `TimedeltaArray`. If either condition is true, a TypeError is raised. This approach ensures that only valid `TimedeltaArray` instances are allowed to proceed, addressing the issue that caused the bug.
