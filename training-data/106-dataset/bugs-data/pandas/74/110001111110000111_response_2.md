The test case `test_infer_from_tdi_mismatch` creates a `TimeedeltaIndex` `tdi` with a frequency of `1s`, and then attempts to create a new `TimeedeltaIndex` with a frequency of `D` using `tdi` as the data. The test expects a `ValueError` to be raised, indicating that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the passed frequency.

The error message indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected when using `tdi._data` with a different frequency.

Upon inspecting the code of the `__new__` method, the issue lies in the logic for handling the frequency input. The logic for checking and handling the frequency of the passed data is causing the bug.

The reason for the bug is that the method may not be handling the frequency comparison correctly. It seems that the comparison between inferred frequency and the passed frequency is not being executed as expected, leading to the issue identified in the test case.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the passed frequency should be handled properly. This may involve checking the frequency of the passed data and comparing it with the specified frequency, raising a `ValueError` if they do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )
    
    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Check inferred frequency and compare with the passed frequency
    inferred_freq = infer_freq(data)
    if inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError("Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency")

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
