The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` instantiation with `tdi._data` and `freq="D"` should have raised a `ValueError` as specified in the test, but it did not. This means that the `TimedeltaIndex` function is not behaving as expected.

The potential error location in the function is the condition checking block. It seems that the conditions may not be properly handling the cases when `freq` does not match the passed values. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the conditions not properly handling the frequency mismatch cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking block to properly handle the cases when `freq` does not match the passed values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray) and data.freq != freq:
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and (data.freq != freq or freq is not None) and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected function, there are additional condition checks to handle the cases when the frequency does not match the passed values. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
