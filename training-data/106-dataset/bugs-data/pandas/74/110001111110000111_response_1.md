The error message indicates that one of the test cases (`TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")`) did not raise the `ValueError` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the conditional statements that check the frequency (`unit`) and `TimedeltaArray` type.

The bug occurs because the conditionals for `unit` and `TimedeltaArray` type are not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect control flow.

To fix the bug, we should correct the conditional statements to properly handle the input cases and raise errors as appropriate.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if data is None:
        data = []
    if not isinstance(data, (list, np.ndarray)):
        data = [data]

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
In the corrected code:
- The conditional checks for the `unit` and `TimedeltaArray` type have been removed as they were not correctly implemented in the original code.
- The data type is checked and converted to a list or numpy array if needed to ensure proper handling.

This corrected code should address the issues and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
