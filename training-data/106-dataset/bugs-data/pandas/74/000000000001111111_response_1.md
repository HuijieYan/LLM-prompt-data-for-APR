The potential error in the provided function is in the handling of the `TimedeltaArray` data and the `copy` parameter. The bug occurs because `copy` is being handled as a general boolean flag, while the expected behavior for `TimedeltaArray` is to call the `copy` method on the `data` object.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the `TimedeltaArray` data and the `copy` parameter. We will also need to ensure that the correct methods are called on the `data` object and the `cls` class.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code:
1. For `TimedeltaArray`, we use the `copy()` method to create a copy of the data if `copy` parameter is True.
2. We updated the returned value to pass the `freq` parameter when creating a `_simple_new` instance.

These changes address the issue with handling `TimedeltaArray` data and the `copy` parameter and ensure that the expected behavior for the provided test case is met.
