The potential error location is in the blocked-out code of the function. 

The bug is likely occurring due to the missing implementation of the function. It seems like someone started to define the function but didn't complete it, which is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to complete the implementation of the function __new__ by removing the pass statement and completing the code as per the intended functionality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
    def __new__(
        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,
        closed=None,
        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )
    
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
    
        # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
