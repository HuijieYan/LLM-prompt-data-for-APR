Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided code is that the function __new__ does not have a return statement for the case when data is an instance of TimedeltaArray or TimedeltaIndex, but freq and name are not None and copy is False. This would result in the function not returning anything in this scenario, leading to a potential logic error.

Reasons behind the bug: 

The bug occurs because the __new__ function does not cover all possible scenarios for the input parameters. It does not have a return statement for certain combinations of the input parameters, leading to a potential logical error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 

To fix the bug, we should add a return statement for the scenario mentioned above where data is an instance of TimedeltaArray or TimedeltaIndex, but freq and name are not None and copy is False.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):

    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Add a return statement for the scenario mentioned above
    if isinstance(data, (TimedeltaArray, TimedeltaIndex)):
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
