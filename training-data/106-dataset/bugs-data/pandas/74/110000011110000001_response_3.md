The test case `test_infer_from_tdi_mismatch` is trying to create a TimedeltaIndex or TimedeltaArray with a frequency that does not match the frequency of the input data. The test is expecting a ValueError to be raised, but it is not being raised when creating a TimedeltaIndex with `tdi._data` and `freq="D"`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of frequencies when creating a TimedeltaIndex or TimedeltaArray.

The bug is occurring because the frequency validation is not being correctly performed when creating a TimedeltaIndex or TimedeltaArray with `tdi._data`. As a result, the ValueError is not being raised as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation is correctly performed for all cases when creating a TimedeltaIndex or TimedeltaArray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    if freq is not None and isinstance(data, pd.Index) and not getattr(data, "freq", None):
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
