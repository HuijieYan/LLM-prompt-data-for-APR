The error message indicates that the TimedeltaIndex is not raising a ValueError as expected when the frequency of the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This implies that the bug is in the TimedeltaIndex function, specifically in the __new__ method.

The potential error location in the code is within the conditional block that checks if the frequency of the passed values conforms to the passed frequency. This condition is not being handled correctly, resulting in the ValueError not being raised when it should.

The bug occurs because the condition to raise a ValueError when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency is not properly implemented. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking the frequency mismatch, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the condition checking for frequency conformity should be updated so that it correctly raises a ValueError when the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {data.freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
        )
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
In the corrected code, the condition for checking the frequency conformity has been updated to correctly raise a ValueError when the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
