The potential error in the given function is that it's not handling the case where `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `copy` is `True`. It is supposed to make a copy of `data` in this case, but the function does not provide for this.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function lacks a conditional branch to handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `copy` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `copy` is `True`. In this case, we should make a copy of `data` before calling `_simple_new()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:  # Handle the case when data is an instance of TimedeltaArray and copy is True
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    # ... (other cases) ...
}
```
In the fixed code, we have added a conditional check to handle the case when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `copy` is `True`. If that condition is met, the code makes a copy of `data` before calling `_simple_new()`.
