The potential error in the function lies in the conditional statements and the usage of the cls._simple_new method. The function tries to handle different cases based on the type of the input data, but there are potential issues with the handling of the TimedeltaArray and TimedeltaIndex data types.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to check the type of the input data (TimedeltaArray and TimedeltaIndex) and handle different cases accordingly, but the checks and handling of these cases are not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input data is of type TimedeltaArray or TimedeltaIndex, and then perform the appropriate actions based on the type of the input data.

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    if isinstance(data, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Series)):
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)

    raise ValueError("Invalid input data type")
