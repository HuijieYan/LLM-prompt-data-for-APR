Based on the error message, the problem occurs when calling the `TimedeltaIndex` method with the `tdi._data` and `freq="D"`. This should raise a `ValueError` with a specific message, but it does not.

The potential error location in the function is within the `__new__` method where the conditional checks for the `data` parameter seem to be incorrect.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug could be that the conditional checks for the input parameters `data` and `freq` are not handling all possible scenarios and data types properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle all possible scenarios and data types for the `data` and `freq` parameters within the `__new__` method to ensure that the correct validations and actions are taken based on the input.

Here's the corrected version of the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if data is None:
        # Handle the case where data is None
        # E.g., return an empty TimedeltaIndex
        return cls._simple_new(np.array([], dtype=_TD_DTYPE))

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Handle the case where data is a sequence or array-like
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )

    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In this version, additional handling for the case where `data` is `None` is included, and the conditional checks are modified to cover various scenarios and data types for the input parameters.
