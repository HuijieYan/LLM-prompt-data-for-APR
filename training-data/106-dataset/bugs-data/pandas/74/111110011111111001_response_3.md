The error message is indicating that the call to `TimedeltaIndex(tdi._data, freq="D")` did not raise a ValueError as expected based on the regular expression provided. This implies that the `TimedeltaIndex` class is not handling the frequency mismatch between the input data and the specified frequency `freq` correctly.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` class is the `__new__` function, specifically where the frequency of the input data needs to be validated with the specified frequency `freq`.

The bug is occurring because the code is not properly checking for frequency mismatches between the input data and the specified frequency `freq`. This leads to the `ValueError` not being raised when it should be.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` function of the `TimedeltaIndex` class needs to be modified to properly handle the validation of frequency mismatches and raise a `ValueError` when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and name is None:
        if freq is not None and data.freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
            )
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected function, the `TimedeltaIndex` checks if the input data and the specified frequency `freq` have a matching frequency. If they do not match, it raises a `ValueError`.
