Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The function is not correctly handling the case when initializing a `TimedeltaIndex` with pre-existing data and overriding the frequency with the `freq` parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `__new__` method fails to handle the case when a `TimedeltaIndex` is initialized with pre-existing data and the frequency is overridden with the `freq` parameter. This leads to the ValueError not being raised properly, as observed in the error message from the test function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `__new__` method to properly handle the scenarios where the frequency from the passed data does not conform to the passed frequency. Specifically, the check for frequency conformity needs to be improved to ensure that the ValueError is raised when the frequency from the passed data does not match the passed frequency.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __new__(
        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,
        closed=None,
        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
        # Handle the case for invalid frequency
        if freq is not None and isinstance(data, (TimedeltaArray, TimedeltaIndex)):
            inferred_freq = getattr(data, "freq", None)
            if inferred_freq is not None and inferred_freq != freq:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
                )
    
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )
    
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    
        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
    
        # ... (additional unchanged logic)
```
In the corrected code, a check for the conformity of the inferred frequency with the passed frequency is added. If the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate error message.
