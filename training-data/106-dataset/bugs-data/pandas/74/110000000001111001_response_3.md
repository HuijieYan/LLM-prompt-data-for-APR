The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where `data` is a TimedeltaIndex and `freq` and `name` are both None.

The bug occurs because the function does not check for the specific case where `data` is a TimedeltaIndex and `freq` and `name` are both None, causing unexpected behavior or potential errors.

To fix the bug, we can add a conditional check for this specific case and return the appropriate value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex):
        if freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional check for the specific case where `data` is a TimedeltaIndex and `freq` and `name` are both None, and return the appropriate value accordingly. This should fix the bug and handle this case appropriately.
