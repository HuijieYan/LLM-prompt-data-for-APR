The error message in the test case indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is failing to raise a `ValueError` when it should. This implies that the constructor's behavior is not aligned with the expected outcome.

The potential error location in the `__new__` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class is the condition that checks if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray`. This condition is followed by a call to `cls._simple_new`, which might not handle the case properly.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method does not handle the case where `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `freq` is not specified. This leads to incorrect behavior and the failure to raise a `ValueError` when it should.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should be modified to handle the case where `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and `freq` is not specified. It should also ensure that the appropriate exception is raised when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError("Frequency 'freq' must be specified when 'data' is a TimedeltaArray")
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if `freq` is specified when `data` is a `TimedeltaArray`. If `freq` is not specified in this case, a `ValueError` is raised to handle this scenario appropriately.
