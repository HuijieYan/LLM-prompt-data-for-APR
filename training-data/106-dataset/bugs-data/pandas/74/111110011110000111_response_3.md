The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when called with the `tdi._data` and `freq="D"`.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` function is in the conditional check for `is_scalar(data)`. It seems that this check is not properly handling the case when `data` is not a scalar, which may lead to the function not raising a `TypeError` as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the checks for the input parameters not properly handling non-scalar input data, causing the function to not raise the expected errors in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks for `is_scalar(data)` and ensure that the function properly handles non-scalar input data and raises the appropriate errors.

The corrected code for the `TimedeltaIndex` function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if data is not None and not is_scalar(data):
        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )

        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()

        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a " "collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )
```
