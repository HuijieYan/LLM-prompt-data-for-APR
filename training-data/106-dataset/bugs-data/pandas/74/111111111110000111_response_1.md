The error message from the test function indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising the expected `ValueError` when `freq` is specified and does not match the inferred frequency from the passed values.

The potential error in the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is in the logic that checks if the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the passed frequency. Currently, the logic seems to be missing or not correctly implemented, causing the test case to fail.

The bug occurs because the constructor does not correctly handle the case where the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the specified frequency.

To fix the bug, the constructor logic needs to be updated to compare the inferred frequency from the passed values with the specified frequency and raise a `ValueError` if they do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data = None,
    unit = None,
    freq = None,
    closed = None,
    dtype = _TD_DTYPE,
    copy = False,
    name = None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )
    
    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )
    
    inferred_freq = infer_freq_from_data(data)
    if freq is not None and inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, the inferred frequency from the passed data is compared with the specified frequency, and a `ValueError` is raised if they do not match. This ensures that the constructor behaves as expected and passes the test case.
