The error message indicates that an expected ValueError was not raised when the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor was called with a `freq` argument that did not match the frequency inferred from the data. This indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the function is the block that handles the creation of a new `TimedeltaArray` when the input data is not of type `TimedeltaArray`. It seems that the logic in that block may be causing the issue.

The bug occurred because the `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` constructors were not properly validating the input frequency against the inferred frequency from the passed values.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the frequency inferred from the passed data matches the `freq` input, and if not, raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

Here's the corrected function with the fix:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    inferred_freq = infer_freq(data)  # Assuming a function infer_freq(data) is available

    if inferred_freq and freq and inferred_freq != freq:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
``` 
In the corrected code, the `infer_freq` function is assumed to be available, and it is used to infer the frequency from the input data. Then, a check is performed to compare the inferred frequency with the input `freq`. If they do not match, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate error message. This should ensure that the constructors for `TimedeltaIndex` and `TimedeltaArray` properly validate the input frequency.
