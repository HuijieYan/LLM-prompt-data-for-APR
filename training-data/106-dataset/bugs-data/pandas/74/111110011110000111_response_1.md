The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is failing to raise a `ValueError` when `freq` input does not match the inferred frequency from the passed values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
    if copy:
        return data.copy()
    else:
        return data._shallow_copy()
```
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where the frequency does not match the inferred frequency from the passed values.

To fix the bug, the code block mentioned above should be modified to correctly raise a `ValueError` when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. Additionally, handling for invalidating the frequency should be implemented.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError("Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency")

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
