The potential error in the given function is that the `TimedeltaArray._from_sequence` method is being called without checking if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and if `freq` and `unit` are not None. 

This could lead to unexpected behavior if `data` is not an instance of `TimedeltaArray` or if `freq` and `unit` are not provided.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaArray` and if `freq` and `unit` are not None before calling `TimedeltaArray._from_sequence`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    if data is not None and unit is not None and freq is not None:
        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)

    # Handle the case where none of the above conditions are met
    raise ValueError("Invalid input parameters for creating TimedeltaIndex")
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to ensure that `TimedeltaArray._from_sequence` is only called if `data` is not None and `unit` and `freq` are provided. If any of these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised to handle the invalid input parameters.
