Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring when trying to create a TimedeltaIndex with a specified frequency ("D") from an input of type TimedeltaIndex.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function "__new__" does not properly handle the case of creating a TimedeltaIndex from an input of type TimedeltaIndex with a specified frequency.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. First, check if the input "data" is of type TimedeltaIndex and the "freq" is not None and then raise a ValueError with the appropriate message.
2. If the above condition is not met, then proceed with the other checks and sequence creation.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to passed frequency"
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and (freq is None and name is None):
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
