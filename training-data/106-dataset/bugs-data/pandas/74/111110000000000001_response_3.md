The potential error in the buggy function is in the condition `if is_scalar(data):` where it checks if the `data` variable is a scalar. This condition should not be there as per the code's logic.

The reason for this bug is that the condition `if is_scalar(data):` is incorrectly raising a TypeError when it shouldn't. This condition is unnecessary and causing the function to raise a TypeError even when a non-scalar input is provided.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary condition `if is_scalar(data):` needs to be removed from the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
