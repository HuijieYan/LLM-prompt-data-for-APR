The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__new__` function definition. The error message suggests that the function does not handle certain input cases properly, leading to a TypeError or ValueError being raised when it should not.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the cases where `data` is of type `TimedeltaArray` and `copy` is False or when `data` is of type `TimedeltaIndex` and `freq` and `name` are None. These cases should be handled differently than what the current implementation does.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` function in the TimedeltaIndex class to properly handle the mentioned cases and cover all possible scenarios with the input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)
    elif isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex):
        if name is None:
            if copy:
                return data.copy()
            else:
                return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
