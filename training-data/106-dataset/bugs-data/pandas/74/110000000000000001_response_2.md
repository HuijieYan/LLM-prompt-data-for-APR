Potential error location: The potential error location in the function is the missing implementation of the maybe_extract_name function and the _simple_new function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The current implementation of the function is incomplete and relies on the implementation of other functions like maybe_extract_name and _simple_new, which are not provided in the code snippet. This will cause the function to raise a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by implementing the missing functions maybe_extract_name and _simple_new, or by removing the calls to these functions from the code.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = name

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
``` 

Alternatively, if the _simple_new and maybe_extract_name functions are meant to be called, then they need to be implemented as well.
