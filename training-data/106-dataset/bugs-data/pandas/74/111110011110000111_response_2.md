The error message is indicating that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is failing to raise a `ValueError` as expected. This suggests that the bug is located within the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor, specifically in the part of the function that is responsible for raising a `ValueError` when the frequency passed does not match the inferred frequency from the data.

The reason behind the bug is likely related to the condition that is checking for matching frequencies and raising the `ValueError`. It seems that this condition is not functioning correctly, which causes the constructor to not raise the expected error.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the frequency mismatch needs to be properly implemented to ensure that it correctly detects and raises a `ValueError` when the frequencies do not match.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and freq != data.freq:
        raise ValueError(
            "Inferred frequency {} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {}".format(
                data.freq, freq
            )
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```
This corrected function includes a condition to check for frequency mismatch when `data` is an instance of `TimedeltaIndex`. If the `data` already has a frequency and it does not match the provided `freq`, it will raise a `ValueError` with a helpful message explaining the mismatch.
