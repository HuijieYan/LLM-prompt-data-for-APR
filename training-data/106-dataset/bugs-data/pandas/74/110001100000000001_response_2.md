Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring at the line `return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)`. This is because the `cls._simple_new` function is being called without being properly defined within the `_new` function.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug is occurring because the `_simple_new` function is being called incorrectly within the `__new__` function. As a result, the function cannot be executed properly.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Define the `_simple_new` function within the `__new__` function so that it can be properly called.
2. Also, ensure that the arguments passed to the `_simple_new` function are correctly formatted and match the expected parameters.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(cls, data, name=name, freq=freq)  # corrected call to _simple_new

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(cls, tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)  # corrected call to _simple_new
