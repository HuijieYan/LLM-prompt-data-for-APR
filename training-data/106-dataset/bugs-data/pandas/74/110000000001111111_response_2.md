Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is during the construction of the TimedeltaArray, where the input parameters are used to create the instance.

Reason for Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the input parameters for constructing the TimedeltaArray instance. It seems that the input parameters are not being used correctly, leading to the generation of the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the input parameters are being used in the construction of TimedeltaArray correctly.
2. Ensure that the data, unit, freq, closed, dtype, copy, and name parameters are utilized appropriately to construct the TimedeltaArray instance.
3. Validate that all the input parameters are compatible and suitable for creating the TimedeltaArray.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Construction of TimedeltaArray -
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, closed=closed, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq, unit=unit, closed=closed)
```

In the corrected code, the construction of the TimedeltaArray has been modified to use the input parameters such as freq, unit, closed, dtype, copy, and name appropriately to create the TimedeltaArray instance. This should address the potential bug and ensure the correct construction of the TimedeltaArray.
