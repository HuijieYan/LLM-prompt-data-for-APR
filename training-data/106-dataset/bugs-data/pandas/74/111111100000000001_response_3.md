The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `_simple_new` method. The method is not being called properly and may result in a runtime error.

The bug occurs because the `_simple_new` method is not being called with the correct arguments. The method expects the first argument to be a class, but it is being called with an instance of the class instead. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

To fix the bug, the `_simple_new` method should be called with the correct arguments, including the class as the first argument.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )
    
    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(cls, data, name=name, freq=freq)  # Call _simple_new with the class as the first argument
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()
    
    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #
    
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(cls, tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)  # Call _simple_new with the class as the first argument
```
