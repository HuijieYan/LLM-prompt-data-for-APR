The error message indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` function did not raise a ValueError as expected. This suggests that the problem lies within the `TimedeltaIndex` function itself.

The potential error location within the `TimedeltaIndex` function is the conditional statements related to frequency validation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional statements for checking frequency validation are not functioning as expected, which causes the `ValueError` not to be raised when it should.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for frequency validation should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the ValueError is raised when the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `TimedeltaIndex` function:

```python
def __new__(
        cls,
        data=None,
        unit=None,
        freq=None,
        closed=None,
        dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
        copy=False,
        name=None,
    ):
        name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

        if is_scalar(data):
            raise TypeError(
                f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
                f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
            )

        if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
            raise ValueError(
                "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
                "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
            )

        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()
            return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

        if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None and data._data.freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                "Inferred frequency {} from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency {}".format(
                    data._data.freq, freq
                )
            )

        # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

        tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
            data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
        )
        return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name, freq=freq)
```
