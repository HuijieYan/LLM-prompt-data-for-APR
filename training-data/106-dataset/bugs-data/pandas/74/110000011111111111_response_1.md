Potential Error Location: The error message suggests that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when called with the parameters `tdi._data` and `freq="D"`.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not validating the inferred frequency from the passed values against the specified `freq` input.
2. The bug could be due to not properly checking or matching the inferred frequency against the specified `freq` input within the `__new__` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add validation logic within the `__new__` method to ensure that the inferred frequency from the passed values conforms to the specified `freq` input.
2. Check the matching of the inferred frequency and the specified `freq` input when creating a new `TimedeltaIndex` object.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # Validate inferred frequency against specified freq input before creating a new object
    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    if isinstance(cls, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is not None:
        inferred_freq = tdarr.inferred_freq
        if inferred_freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq}"
            )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
