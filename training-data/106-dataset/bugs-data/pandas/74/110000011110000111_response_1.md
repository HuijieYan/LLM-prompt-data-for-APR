The error message indicates that the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor is not raising a `ValueError` as expected. This suggests that the issue lies within the `TimedeltaIndex` constructor, which is the `__new__` function provided.

The potential error location within the `__new__` function is the block of code where it checks the frequency of the timedelta data and raises a `ValueError` if it does not match the input frequency.

The reason behind the bug might be that the frequency comparison logic within the function is incorrect or not functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the frequency comparison logic to ensure it correctly validates the input frequency against the frequency of the timedelta data.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )

    if freq and unit:
        inferred_freq = infer_freq(data, unit)
        if inferred_freq and inferred_freq != freq:
            raise ValueError(
                f"The inferred frequency {inferred_freq} from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency {freq}"
            )

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, a new check for the inferred frequency from the passed values is added, and if it exists and does not match the input frequency, a `ValueError` is raised to match the expected behavior in the test case.
