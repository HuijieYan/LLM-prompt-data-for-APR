Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring at the line "if unit in {"Y", "y", "M"}:", where it is checking if the unit is in the set {"Y", "y", "M"}.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition is checking if the unit is in a set containing "{Y, y, M}". However, the error message suggests that units 'M' and 'Y' are no longer supported. Therefore, this condition should be adjusted accordingly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the unit is 'M' or 'Y' and raise a ValueError accordingly.
2. Remove the check for unit 'M' and 'Y' if these units are no longer supported.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __new__(
    cls,
    data=None,
    unit=None,
    freq=None,
    closed=None,
    dtype=_TD_DTYPE,
    copy=False,
    name=None,
):
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if is_scalar(data):
        raise TypeError(
            f"{cls.__name__}() must be called with a "
            f"collection of some kind, {repr(data)} was passed"
        )

    if unit in {"Y", "y"}:
        raise ValueError(
            "Units 'Y' and 'y' are no longer supported, as they do not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )
    
    if unit == "M":
        raise ValueError(
            "Unit 'M' is no longer supported, as it does not "
            "represent unambiguous timedelta values durations."
        )
    
    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaArray):
        if copy:
            data = data.copy()
        return cls._simple_new(data, name=name, freq=freq)

    if isinstance(data, TimedeltaIndex) and freq is None and name is None:
        if copy:
            return data.copy()
        else:
            return data._shallow_copy()

    # - Cases checked above all return/raise before reaching here - #

    tdarr = TimedeltaArray._from_sequence(
        data, freq=freq, unit=unit, dtype=dtype, copy=copy
    )
    return cls._simple_new(tdarr, name=name)
