The error message indicates a problem with the assignment of values to a boolean array using NumPy. This error occurs when trying to update a Series with a mask and new values, particularly when the dtype is "string" and "Int64".

The issue seems to lie in the `putmask` method, where the `new_values[mask] = new` statement is causing the ValueError. This happens because the boolean array indexing assignment operation is attempting to assign multiple input values to a single output value where the mask is true.

The bug occurs because the `putmask` method is not handling the numpy boolean array indexing assignment correctly when the dtype of the Series is "string" or "Int64".

To fix this bug, the `putmask` method needs to be modified to handle the numpy boolean array indexing assignment properly for all dtypes, including "string" and "Int64". This could involve adjusting the assignment operation to ensure that it works correctly for different dtypes.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if new_values.dtype == "object":
        new_values = new_values.astype("string")

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, there's an additional check for the dtype of `new_values`. If the dtype is "object", it is converted to "string" to ensure that the boolean array indexing assignment works correctly. This change ensures that the `putmask` method handles all dtypes, including "string" and "Int64", without raising a ValueError.
