The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `Block` class. The error message indicates a ValueError related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

The reason behind the bug is that the `putmask` method is not handling the new nullable dtypes (like the ones with `pd.NA`) properly, resulting in the ValueError. The method is trying to perform boolean array indexing assignment, which is not working as expected for the new nullable dtypes.

To fix the bug, the `putmask` method should be updated to handle the new nullable dtypes properly. It should check for the dtype of the series and handle the boolean array indexing assignment accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if isinstance(new, pd.StringDtype) or pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(new.dtype):
        # Handle string and integer dtypes separately
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        new_values[mask] = pd.array(new, dtype=self.values.dtype)

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
``` 

In the corrected code, I added a check for the dtype of the `new` values. If the dtype is a string or integer type, it directly performs the boolean array indexing assignment. Otherwise, it converts `new` to a pandas array with the same dtype as `self.values` before performing the assignment.
