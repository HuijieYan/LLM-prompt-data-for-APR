The error occurs in the `putmask` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment, where 2 input values are being assigned to 1 output value when the mask is true, which causes a ValueError.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of boolean array indexing and assignment in the `putmask` function, specifically when trying to assign values to the `new_values` array using boolean masks.

To fix this bug, the `putmask` function should be modified to correctly handle boolean array indexing and assignment. This can be achieved by ensuring that the shape of the mask is compatible with the shape of the array being modified, and that the assignment operation is performed appropriately.

Here's the corrected `putmask` function:

```python
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import ExtensionBlock
from pandas.core.arrays.string_ import StringArray
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas._typing import List
import numpy as np

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if new_values.shape != mask.shape:  # Ensure the compatibility of shapes
        raise ValueError("Shapes of new_values and mask are not compatible")

    new_values[mask] = new  # Perform the assignment operation correctly
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]

setattr(ExtensionBlock, 'putmask', putmask)  # Set the corrected putmask function to ExtensionBlock
```

This corrected code addresses the issues related to boolean array indexing and assignment, ensuring that the assignment operation is performed correctly and is compatible with the shapes of the arrays involved.
