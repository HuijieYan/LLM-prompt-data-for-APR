The error message indicates that there is an issue with the assignment of values based on a boolean mask in the `putmask` method of `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message mentions "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign [input values] to the [output values] where the mask is true".

The potential location of the error is identified in the `putmask` method, specifically in the following line:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```
This line is responsible for assigning the new values to the `new_values` array based on the boolean `mask`.

The bug occurs because when performing the assignment `new_values[mask] = new`, there is an attempt to assign multiple input values to a single output value. This is not allowed in NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to modify the `putmask` method to iterate over the indexes of the mask and assign the values individually.

Here's the corrected `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    for i in range(len(mask)):
        if mask[i]:
            new_values[i] = new[i]  # Assign individual values based on the mask

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected method, the `putmask` iterates over the indexes of the mask and assigns the values individually based on the mask.

This should resolve the ValueError that was occurring during the assignment of values based on the boolean mask in the `putmask` method.
