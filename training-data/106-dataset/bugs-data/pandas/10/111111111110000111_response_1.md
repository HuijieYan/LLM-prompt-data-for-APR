Looking at the error messages from the test function, we can see that the issue occurs when the `update` method is used on a Series with dtype "string", "Int64", and "boolean". The error is specifically related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

The potential error location within the `putmask` method in the `pandas.core.internals.blocks.py` file, which includes the following line:

```python
new_values[mask] = new
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `new_values[mask] = new` assignment is causing a ValueError due to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment correctly within the `putmask` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method in the `pandas.core.internals.blocks.py` file:

```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    # Handle NumPy boolean array indexing assignment
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray):
        if len(new) == np.sum(mask):  # Ensure the number of elements in 'new' matches the sum of 'mask'
            new_values[mask] = new
        else:
            raise ValueError("Number of elements in 'new' does not match the sum of 'mask'")
    else:
        raise ValueError("'new' must be a NumPy array")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment by checking the length of `new` and comparing it with the sum of `mask`. If the lengths do not match, a ValueError is raised. Additionally, we ensure that `new` is a NumPy array before performing the assignment.
