The bug occurs in the putmask method of the ExtensionBlock class. The error message "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 3 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" indicates that there is an issue with boolean array indexing assignment.

The issue is likely caused by incorrect boolean array indexing assignment when updating the new values based on the mask. This can lead to either incorrect assignment of values or an attempt to assign multiple values to a single output position.

To fix this bug, the boolean array indexing assignment logic needs to be corrected and validated to ensure that it properly updates the new values based on the mask.

Here is the corrected code for the putmask method of the ExtensionBlock class:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values.copy()  # Always create a copy of self.values

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(new_values)]  # Create a new block with the updated values
```

In the corrected code, a copy of self.values is always created before making any updates, ensuring that the original values are preserved. The boolean array indexing assignment logic is also modified to correctly update the new values based on the mask.

With these changes, the putmask method should work correctly without raising any errors, regardless of the dtype of the input data.
