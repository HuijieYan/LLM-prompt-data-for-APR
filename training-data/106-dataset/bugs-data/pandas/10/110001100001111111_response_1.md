Based on the provided function and the error message, it seems like the issue is related to the dtype="string" and dtype="Int64" used in the test cases. The bug is occurring when the update method is called on a Series with these specific dtypes.

The nature of the bug could be related to the implementation of the putmask function in the blocks.py file. The putmask function should handle the numpy boolean array indexing and assignment properly for Series with dtype="string" and dtype="Int64".

To fix the bug, the putmask function should be updated to handle the numpy boolean array indexing and assignment for Series with dtype="string" and dtype="Int64". This might involve making changes to how the boolean array indexing and assignment is handled for these specific dtypes.

Here is the corrected code for the putmask function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, StringArray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if isinstance(new_values, StringArray) or isinstance(new_values, IntegerArray):
        new_values = new_values.setitem(mask, new)
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new
    
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, the `_safe_reshape` function properly handles the reshaping of the mask, and the specific handling for Series with dtype="string" and dtype="Int64" involves using the `setitem` function for these specific dtypes. This will ensure that the boolean array indexing and assignment is handled correctly for these dtypes, addressing the bug for the specific cases mentioned.

Please note that the implementation of the `setitem` function for StringArray and IntegerArray may vary based on the specific implementation of these classes in the pandas library. This code assumes a hypothetical implementation for the `setitem` function.
