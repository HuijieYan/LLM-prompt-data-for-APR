The error is occurring in the `putmask` function due to an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. It seems that when trying to assign new values based on a mask, there is a discrepancy in the number of input values and the number of output values where the mask is true.

The bug is likely in the line:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```

This is where the error message indicates the problem with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the dimensions of `new_values`, `mask`, and `new` align properly before performing the assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    # Ensure the dimensions align properly
    if len(new_values) == len(mask) == len(new):
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        raise ValueError("Dimensions of new_values, mask, and new do not align.")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the dimensions of `new_values`, `mask`, and `new` align properly before performing the assignment. If the dimensions do not align, it raises a `ValueError` to indicate the issue.
