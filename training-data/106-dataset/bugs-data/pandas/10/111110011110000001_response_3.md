The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment in the `putmask` function of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error seems to occur when attempting to set values based on a boolean array mask.

The potential error within the `putmask` function might be in the line:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```

The reason for the bug is that when assigning values to a NumPy array using boolean indexing, the dimensions of the boolean mask and the array being assigned must match. If their dimensions do not match, a ValueError is raised.

To fix this bug, the code can be corrected to ensure that the dimensions of the boolean mask are compatible with the array being assigned to.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:
```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new  # This line is changed to update values based on the mask

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
In the corrected code, the `mask` array is used to update the `new_values` array directly without altering its shape or dimensions. This fix ensures that the boolean mask and the array dimensions are compatible, addressing the ValueError reported in the error message.
