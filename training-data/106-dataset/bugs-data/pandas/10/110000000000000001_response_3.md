Potential error location: The error may occur when trying to extract the boolean array 'mask' using the _extract_bool_array function. This function may not be defined in the current context, leading to an error when trying to use it.

Reasons behind the bug: The _extract_bool_array function is not defined in the current context, so trying to use it to extract the boolean array 'mask' will result in a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the _extract_bool_array function in the current context, or use an alternative method to extract the boolean array.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = np.asarray(mask, dtype=bool)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(np.atleast_1d(new)) == len(mask):
        new = np.asarray(new)[mask]

    mask = np.broadcast_to(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, the _extract_bool_array function has been replaced with np.asarray to convert 'mask' to a boolean array. The alternative np.atleast_1d function is used to handle the case where 'new' is a scalar. The np.broadcast_to function is used to ensure that the 'mask' array has the same shape as 'new_values' before applying it.
