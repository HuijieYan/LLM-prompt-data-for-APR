Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `new = new[mask]` because it tries to access an element from `new` using a boolean array `mask`, and the length of `new` is compared with the length of `mask`, which may lead to an error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the line `new = new[mask]` assumes that the length of `new` and `mask` are the same, and it tries to extract elements from `new` based on the boolean mask `mask`. In the given test cases, the lengths of `new` and `mask` are not guaranteed to be the same, leading to potential errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of `new` and `mask` before attempting to extract elements from `new`.
2. Ensure that the dimensions of `new` and `mask` are compatible for the extraction operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from numpy import ndarray, array
from pandas import validate_bool_kwarg

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        # Check if the length of new and mask is the same and perform the extraction
        new = new[array(mask)]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that the length of `new` and `mask` are the same before attempting to extract elements from `new`. If the lengths are the same, we use `new[array(mask)]` to extract elements from `new`.
