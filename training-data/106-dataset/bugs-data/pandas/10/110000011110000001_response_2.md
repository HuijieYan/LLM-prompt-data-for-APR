The error message indicates a problem with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment, where it cannot assign 2 input values to the 1 output value when the mask is true. This suggests that there is an issue with the implementation of the `putmask` function in the provided code.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the error is likely occurring in the section where `new_values[mask] = new` is being performed. This implies that the indexing and assignment operation is not functioning as expected when dealing with boolean masks.

The bug occurs because the boolean mask used for indexing the `new_values` array does not properly align with the shape of the `new` array, leading to an incorrect assignment of values.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the boolean mask used for indexing (`mask`) aligns with the shape of the `new` array. This may involve reshaping the mask or the new array to match each other. Additionally, it may be necessary to validate and handle the dimensions of the arrays to ensure compatibility.

Below is the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    # Ensure the mask and new array align in shape
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    # Reshape the mask if necessary
    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    # Perform the assignment based on the boolean mask
    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, we have added a step to ensure that the `new` array aligns with the shape of the `mask` array by applying the mask to the `new` array. Additionally, the `mask` array is reshaped if necessary to ensure compatibility with the `new` array. These adjustments should resolve the issue with the boolean array indexing assignment.
