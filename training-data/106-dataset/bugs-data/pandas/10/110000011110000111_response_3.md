The error occurs within the `putmask` method of the `Block` class. The error is related to the assignment of values to the `new_values` array using boolean array indexing. This error occurs because the length of the input values does not match the length of the mask. 

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the length of the new values does not match the length of the mask properly.

To fix the bug, the `putmask` method should check the length of the new values and mask and handle the mismatch appropriately. One way to handle this is to resize the mask to match the length of the new values.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    new = _safe_reshape(new, self.values.shape)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and np.size(new) == np.sum(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        raise ValueError("Length of new values does not match the length of the mask")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, the new values are reshaped using the `_safe_reshape` function to match the shape of the mask. This ensures that the dimensions of the new values and the mask match, allowing for the correct assignment of values.

This fix should address the ValueError that occurs when using the `update` method with nullable dtypes such as string and Int16.
