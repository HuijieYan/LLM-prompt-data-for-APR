The potential error location within the `putmask` function is with the line `new_values[mask] = new`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the assignment `new_values[mask] = new` is trying to assign multiple values to the output values where the mask is true, which is not allowed.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use Boolean indexing to update the `new_values` array based on the mask.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    # Apply boolean indexing to update new_values based on the mask
    new_values[mask] = new[mask]

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
