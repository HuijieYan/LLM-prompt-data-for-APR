The error message indicates a problem with boolean array indexing assignment, specifically stating that NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 2 input values to the 1 output value where the mask is true. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the `new` values are being assigned to the `new_values` array using the `mask`.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The assignment `new_values[mask] = new` might be causing the error due to incorrect handling of boolean array indexing.

The bug occurred because the boolean array was being used to index the `new_values` array for assignment, but the behavior was not as expected. The boolean array indexing assignment allows for different lengths of the mask and the values being assigned, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can use the boolean array as a mask to identify the specific positions where the assignment will occur, and then assign values at those positions using a loop. This will ensure that the length of the boolean array mask and the values being assigned match, preventing the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    for i in range(len(mask)):
        if mask[i]:
            new_values[i] = new[i]

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we loop through the `mask` array to identify the positions where the assignment should occur, and then assign the corresponding values from the `new` array to the `new_values` array. This ensures that the length of the boolean array mask and the values being assigned are consistent, resolving the ValueError.
