The potential error in the code is likely to be around the conditional statement `if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):`. This is because the `len()` function will not work on arrays of non-numeric types such as StringArray, IntegerArray, or BooleanArray. 

The code is using `isinstance(new, np.ndarray)` to check if `new` is a numpy array, but it should account for the specific array types such as StringArray, IntegerArray, or BooleanArray.

To fix this issue, we should update the conditional statement to check if `new` is an instance of one of these array types and then compare the length of the specific array type. We can also remove the line `mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)` as this may not be necessary and can cause issues with reshaping arrays of different types.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, (np.ndarray, StringArray, IntegerArray, BooleanArray)) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

By using `isinstance()` with a tuple of specific array types and removing the unnecessary reshaping, we ensure that the code can handle different types of arrays and correctly compare their lengths.
