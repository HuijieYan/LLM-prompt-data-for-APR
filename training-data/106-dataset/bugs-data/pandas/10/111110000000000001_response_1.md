Potential error location:
The error could be caused by the line `new = new[mask]`. If `new` is not an ndarray, this line would raise an error. Additionally, if the length of `new` does not match the length of `mask`, it would also raise an error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case where `new` is not an ndarray or when its length does not match the length of `mask`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `new` is an ndarray before using it as an index.
2. Check if the length of `new` matches the length of `mask`.
3. If `new` is not an ndarray, consider other approaches for updating the `new_values` array.

Corrected code:
```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray):
        if len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Length of 'new' does not match the length of 'mask'.")
    else:
        # Handle the case where 'new' is not an ndarray
        # Implement the desired logic here

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
