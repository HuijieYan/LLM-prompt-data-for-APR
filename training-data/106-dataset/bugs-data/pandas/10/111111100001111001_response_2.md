The buggy function `putmask` seems to be trying to modify the `new_values` array based on the `mask` array. It seems to be encountering an error in handling the `mask` array and hence is failing to modify `new_values` as expected. The issue could be related to the incorrect extraction of a boolean array or the wrong reshaping of the `mask`. 

The code snippet that seems to be causing the issue is:

```python
if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
    new = new[mask]

mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

new_values[mask] = new
```

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. In the condition checking for the type of `new`, ensure that the dtype of the extracted array `new` matches the dtype of `new_values`.
2. Check the logic for reshaping the `mask` and ensure that it's compatible with the shape of `new_values`.
3. Verify that the boolean array extraction logic in the `mask` variable is correctly converting the input `mask` to a boolean array.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:
```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask) and new.dtype == new_values.dtype:  # Check dtype equality
        new = new[mask]
    
    # Reshape the mask to match the shape of new_values
    if mask.size != new_values.size:
        raise ValueError("Length of mask and new_values must be equal")
    mask = mask.ravel()

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
