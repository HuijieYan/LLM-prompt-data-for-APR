The error message indicates that the bug is likely in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error is related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.

The issue with the current implementation is that when updating the values with a mask, the new array might be of a different size than the mask's size, leading to a ValueError when trying to assign values to the masked locations.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the `mask` and `new` arrays have the same size before performing the assignment.

Here's the corrected `putmask` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import ExtensionBlock
from pandas._libs.lib import maybe_convert_objects

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
):
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    if not inplace:
        values = self.values.copy()
    else:
        values = self.values

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new = maybe_convert_objects(new)
    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, values.shape)

    if new.shape != mask.shape:
        raise ValueError("Mask and new array must have the same shape")

    values[mask] = new
    return ExtensionBlock(values)
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check to ensure that the `new` array and the `mask` have the same shape before performing the assignment. If they do not have the same shape, a ValueError is raised. If they have the same shape, the assignment is performed, and the modified `ExtensionBlock` with updated values is returned.
