The bug in the `putmask` function lies in the code segment `return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]`. The error message may be related to this line, as it returns a list containing a single object.

The bug occurs because the `make_block` method is not called correctly. The `self` parameter is missing in the method call, so it should be `self.make_block`. Additionally, it does not provide the `placement` argument required for the `make_block` method.

To fix this bug, the `make_block` method should be called with the `self` parameter and the `placement` argument. The corrected code for the `putmask` function is as follows:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values, placement=None)]  # Call make_block method with self and placement
```
In the corrected code, the `make_block` method is called with the `self` parameter as well as the required `placement` argument.
