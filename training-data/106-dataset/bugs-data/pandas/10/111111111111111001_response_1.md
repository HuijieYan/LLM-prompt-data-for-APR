The `putmask` function is experiencing an error when the `new_values` variable is being updated using boolean array indexing and the `mask` array. The error message indicates that the assignment of multiple input values to a single output value where the mask is true is causing a ValueError.

The potential error location is in the line `new_values[mask] = new` inside the `putmask` function.

The issue is occurring because the boolean array `mask` is not properly aligned with the `new` values or there is an inconsistency in the length of the mask and new values.

To fix this issue, the code can be modified to ensure that the `new` variable and the `mask` array are properly aligned before updating the `new_values` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, the conditional statement checks if the length of the `new` array matches the length of the `mask` array. If they are of equal length, the `new` array is updated only where the `mask` array is True. Otherwise, an error message can be raised to indicate the mismatch in the lengths of `new` and `mask`.

This approach ensures that the boolean array and the new values are properly aligned before updating the `new_values` array, thus preventing the ValueError mentioned in the error messages.
