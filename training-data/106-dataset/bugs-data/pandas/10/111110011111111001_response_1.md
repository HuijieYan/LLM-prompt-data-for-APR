The bug in the provided function is related to the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error messages from the test cases suggest that there is an issue with assigning values based on a boolean array index. This indicates that the error occurs when trying to update the `new_values` array using a boolean mask.

The potential error location is within the following line of code:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `new_values` array and the `new` array might not have matching shapes or dimensions. Additionally, in certain cases, the boolean mask `mask` might not align with the shape of the `new_values` array, causing a mismatch during assignment.

To fix the bug, the `mask` array should be coerced or reshaped to match the shape of `new_values` before performing the assignment.

The corrected code for the `putmask` method is as follows:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, self.values.shape)  # Reshape mask to match self.values

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code:
- The `mask` array is reshaped using `_safe_reshape` to match the shape of `self.values`.
- Then the `new` values are assigned to `new_values` using the boolean `mask` array.

These changes should address the issues related to the boolean array indexing assignment and resolve the bug.
