The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class, which is used in the `update` method of the `Series` class. The error message shows that the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign multiple input values to the output values where the mask is True.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect masking of the values in the `putmask` method. The mask is not being applied correctly to the new values, which results in the ValueError.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the mask is applied correctly to the new values before assignment. This involves modifying the logic for applying the mask and replacing values in the `putmask` method. Additionally, the logic for handling nullable dtypes such as `Int64`, `string`, and `boolean` should be considered to handle these cases properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    # Apply the mask to the new values
    new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected code, the mask is correctly applied to the new values before assignment, addressing the original bug. This should fix the issue where Series.update() raises ValueError for dtype="string", `Int64`, and `boolean`.
