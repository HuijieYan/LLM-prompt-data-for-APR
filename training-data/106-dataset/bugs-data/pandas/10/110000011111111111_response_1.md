The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the buggy function, specifically in the line `new_values[mask] = new`. The error message indicates that a ValueError is raised due to "NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign x input values to the y output values where the mask is true."

The bug occurs because the index array `mask` is not reshaped or aligned properly with the `new` values, leading to a mismatch in the number of input and output values.

To fix the bug, the mask array needs to be reshaped or aligned with the `new` values to ensure that the boolean indexing assignment operates on arrays of compatible shapes.

Here's the corrected `putmask` method for the buggy function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    else:
        new = np.where(mask, new, new_values)  # Align new with mask

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In this corrected method:
1. An `else` statement has been added to align the `new` array with the mask if they have different shapes.
2. The `np.where` function is used to align `new` with the mask, ensuring that the number of input and output values match during boolean indexing assignment.

This should resolve the ValueError that occurs when using the `update` method with different data types such as string and Nullable integer types.
