The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the assignment of values to a mask where the mask is boolean.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the `putmask` method is not handling the boolean array indexing assignment correctly.

To fix the bug, the boolean array indexing assignment needs to be modified to handle the assignment of values to the mask properly. This can be accomplished by checking the dimensions of the mask and the values being assigned.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == np.sum(mask):  # check the dimensions of the mask and the values being assigned
        new_values[mask] = new  # proper assignment of values to the mask
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid dimensions for boolean array indexing assignment")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

By making these changes, the `putmask` method should be able to handle the boolean array indexing assignment correctly and avoid the ValueError raised in the test cases.
