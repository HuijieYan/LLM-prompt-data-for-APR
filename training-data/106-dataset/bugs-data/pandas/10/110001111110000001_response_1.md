The buggy function `putmask` is causing the test case `test_update_extension_array_series` to fail. The error message shows that NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign multiple input values to a single output value where the mask is true.

The issue is arising from the line `new_values[mask] = new` in the `putmask` function. When we are trying to assign the `new` values to `new_values` based on the `mask`, it's causing the error because the mask is not aligned with the shape of the `new_values` array.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the mask is reshaped to match the shape of `new_values`. This can be achieved by using the `_safe_reshape` function with the `mask` and `new_values.shape`.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:

```python
# corrected putmask function
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)  # Corrected line

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

By incorporating the `_safe_reshape` function to reshape the mask, we ensure that the `new_values[mask] = new` operation has a proper alignment and no longer causes the previous error.
