Potential error:
The bug in the provided function is that it is referencing `self.make_block(values=new_values)` instead of `make_block(values=new_values)`. The `make_block` function is defined outside of the `ExtensionBlock` class, so it should be called directly without referencing `self`.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `make_block` function is not being called correctly. It should be referenced directly using `make_block` rather than `self.make_block`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `make_block` function should be called directly outside of the class, as it is not an instance method. Additionally, the data type of the return value of the `putmask` function should be corrected to match the return type according to the function's signature.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
    ) -> List[Block]:
        """
        See Block.putmask.__doc__
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    
        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]
    
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
    
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [make_block(values=new_values)]
```
