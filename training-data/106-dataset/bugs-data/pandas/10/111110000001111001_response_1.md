Potential error location:
The potential error location within the `putmask` function is the line `new_values[mask] = new`. This line tries to assign the `new` array to a subset of `new_values` based on the `mask`. If the lengths of `new` and `mask` do not match, this line will raise an error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the length of the `new` array and the `mask` array might not match, causing a potential indexing issue and leading to an assignment error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of the `new` and `mask` arrays to ensure that they match before performing the assignment operation.
2. If the lengths of `new` and `mask` do not match, either adjust the length of `new` or mask to make them compatible, or handle the mismatch in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
    ) -> List["Block"]:
        """
        See Block.putmask.__doc__
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    
        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    
        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Length of 'new' does not match the length of the mask.")
    
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
    
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
