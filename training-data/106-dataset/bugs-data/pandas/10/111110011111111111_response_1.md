The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates a problem with the assignment of values using boolean array indexing.

The issue arises because the method tries to directly modify the `new_values` array using boolean indexing without accounting for the potential mismatch in the dimensions of `new_values`, `mask`, and `new`. This can result in a ValueError when the method attempts to assign multiple values to a single location in the array.

To fix this issue, a more robust approach is needed to handle the boolean indexing and assignment of values.

Below is the corrected code for the `putmask` method.

```python
from pandas.core.internals import Block

class ExtensionBlock(Block):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def putmask(
        self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
    ) -> List["Block"]:
        """
        See Block.putmask.__doc__
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

        mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

        new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

        if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
            new = new[mask]

        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

        # Create a copy of new_values to avoid modifying the original array
        modified_values = new_values.copy()

        # Use boolean indexing to assign new values to the masked locations
        modified_values[mask] = new

        # Create a new block with the modified values and return it in a list
        return [self.make_block(values=modified_values)]
```

The corrections made include creating a copy of the `new_values` array to avoid modifying the original array. This copy is then used for the boolean indexing assignment of new values. Additionally, the modified values are used to create a new block, which is returned in a list.

These changes ensure that the boolean indexing and assignment of values are done in a safe and explicit manner, addressing the potential error mentioned in the error message.
