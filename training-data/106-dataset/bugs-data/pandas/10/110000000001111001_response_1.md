The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of the 'inplace' parameter and its validation.
2. Incorrect manipulation of the 'new' values based on the provided 'mask'.
3. Incorrect return value construction using 'self.make_block' method.
4. Lack of proper error handling and validation for input parameters.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
1. The 'inplace' parameter is not being handled properly, leading to potential unwanted modification of the original data when 'inplace=True'.
2. The manipulation of 'new' values based on the provided 'mask' is not taking into account the data types and shapes, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
3. The construction of the return value using 'self.make_block' method might not be appropriate.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the 'inplace' parameter and validate its value.
2. Make sure to handle the manipulation of 'new' values based on the 'mask' provided, considering data types and shapes appropriately.
3. Ensure proper error handling and validation for input parameters.
4. Construct the return value properly, considering the specific requirements and data types involved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Union
import numpy as np

# Corrected function
def putmask(
    self, mask: np.ndarray, new: Union[np.ndarray, List[Union[int, float, str]]], inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = bool(inplace)
    mask = np.asarray(mask, dtype=bool)

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == mask.sum():
        new = new[mask]

    if inplace:
        self.values[mask] = new
        return [self]
    else:
        new_values = np.copy(self.values)
        new_values[mask] = new
        return [self.make_block(new_values)]
```

Changes made in the corrected code:
1. Proper handling and validation of the 'inplace' parameter.
2. Conversion of 'mask' to a NumPy boolean array for consistency.
3. Improved handling of 'new' values based on the provided 'mask'.
4. Constructing the return value appropriately based on the 'inplace' parameter.
