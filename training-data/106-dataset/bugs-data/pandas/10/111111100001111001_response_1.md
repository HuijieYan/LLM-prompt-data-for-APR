The given function putmask has an issue when dealing with the mask array and the new values. The problem arises due to the potentially inconsistent lengths of the mask and new arrays. When attempting to select values from the 'new' array using the 'mask', their lengths might not always match.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the 'new' array is either broadcastable or its length is the same as the number of True values in the 'mask' array.

Below is the corrected code for the putmask function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    n_true = np.count_nonzero(mask)
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == n_true:
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        # Handle the case when 'new' is broadcastable to match the shape of 'mask'
        if np.prod(new_values.shape[axis:]) == len(new):
            new_values[mask] = new
        else:
            raise ValueError("Incompatible lengths of mask and new array")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected function, we calculate the number of True values in the 'mask' array and compare it with the length of the 'new' array. If they are the same, we update the 'new_values' array accordingly. Additionally, we handle the case where 'new' is broadcastable to match the shape of 'mask'. If the lengths are incompatible, we raise a ValueError.
