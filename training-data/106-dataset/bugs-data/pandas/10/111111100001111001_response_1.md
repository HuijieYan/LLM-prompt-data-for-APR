The `putmask` function is intended to replace values in `new_values` based on the provided `mask` array. However, the function has several issues. 

1. The use of `self.make_block(values=new_values)` to create a new `Block` instance is misleading, as the `make_block` method is already defined in the `ExtensionBlock` class.
2. There is one additional `shape` method defined for the `ExtensionBlock` class which is redundant.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following:

1. Use the `make_block` method directly without specifying `self` explicitly.
2. Remove the redundant `shape` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` function:
```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```
