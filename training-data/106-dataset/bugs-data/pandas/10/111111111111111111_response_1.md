The error occurs in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class which tries to set values based on a boolean mask. The error message suggests that there is a problem with how the boolean array indexing assignment is being performed.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the boolean array indexing assignment is not working correctly with the new nullable dtypes (e.g., string and Int64).

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `putmask` method to handle nullable dtypes properly and perform the boolean array indexing assignment correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()
    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    if isinstance(new_values, StringArray) or isinstance(new_values, IntegerArray) or isinstance(new_values, BooleanArray):
        new_values = new_values.setitem(mask, new)
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

This corrected method includes additional checks for the type of `new_values` to handle nullable dtypes, and uses the `setitem` method when necessary to handle the boolean array indexing assignment correctly.
