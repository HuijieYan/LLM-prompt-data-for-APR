The error message provided indicates that there is an issue with the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. It states that 2 input values cannot be assigned to the 1 output value where the mask is true.

Upon analyzing the original function, it appears that the bug lies in the portion of the code where the new values are being assigned to the mask. The issue is likely related to the reshaping of the boolean mask and the subsequent assignment of the new values based on this mask.

To fix this bug, the code could be modified to perform a direct assignment of new values to the mask without the need for reshaping and other transformations.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    
    inplace = pd.api.types.is_bool(inplace)

    mask = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

This corrected code bypasses the reshaping and directly assigns new values to the mask based on the original shape of the array. It should resolve the issue with the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.
