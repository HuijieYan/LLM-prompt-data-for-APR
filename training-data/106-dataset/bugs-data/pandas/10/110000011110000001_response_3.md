The error message indicates that there is an issue with NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. This suggests that the problem might be related to how the boolean array indexing is being used in the `putmask` method.

The issue is most likely occurring due to the incorrect assignment of new values to the `new_values` array using boolean indexing. The `new` array is not being assigned correctly to the `new_values` array based on the provided mask, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the boolean array indexing is being used correctly to assign new values to the `new_values` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, the `if` block is modified to correctly assign the new values to the `new_values` array based on the provided mask. If the `new` array matches the length of the mask, it is directly assigned using boolean indexing. Otherwise, the mask is reshaped and then used for the assignment.

This should resolve the issue and prevent the ValueError related to NumPy boolean array indexing assignment.
