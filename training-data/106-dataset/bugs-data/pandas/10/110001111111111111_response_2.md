The error is occurring in the `putmask` method of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with boolean array indexing assignment when the mask is true.

This issue is likely occurring because the boolean array indexing is not aligning properly with the values being assigned. It seems that the boolean array may not be of the correct length, leading to the mismatch.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the boolean array used for indexing has the same length as the values being assigned.
2. Checking for inconsistencies in the boolean array and the values being assigned.

Here's the corrected code for the `putmask` method:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values.copy()  # Always create a copy

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    # Ensure the mask has the same length as the new_values
    if len(mask) != new_values.shape[axis]:
        raise ValueError("Mask length must match the array shape")

    # Apply the mask to the new_values
    new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, we're making sure that the mask has the same length as the values array before applying the boolean array indexing. This should prevent the ValueError related to boolean array indexing assignment.
