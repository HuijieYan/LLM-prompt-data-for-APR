    Block for holding extension types.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This holds all 3rd-party extension array types. It's also the immediate
    parent class for our internal extension types' blocks, CategoricalBlock.
    
    ExtensionArrays are limited to 1-D.

            raise ValueError("mask and new_values must have the same shape")

```
In the corrected function, I made a few changes:
1. Removed the unnecessary 'shape' method.
2. Updated the 'putmask' method to copy 'self.values' when inplace is True, in order to avoid modifying the original 'self.values' in place.
3. Added a check to ensure that 'mask' and 'new_values' have the same shape before updating the 'new_values'.

This should address the issues in the buggy function and provide the expected behavior for the given input parameters.
