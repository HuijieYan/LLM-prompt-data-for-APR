Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `new = new[mask]` where the new array is being filtered based on the mask.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is likely due to the fact that the line `new = new[mask]` assumes that the new array is the same length as the mask, which may not always be the case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Check the length of the new array before filtering it based on the mask, and handle the case where the lengths are not equal.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]
        mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)
        new_values[mask] = new
    else:
        raise ValueError("Length of new array does not match the length of the mask.")

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
