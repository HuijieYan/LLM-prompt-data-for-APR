The bug is occurring within the `putmask` function of the `ExtensionBlock` class. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the NumPy boolean array indexing assignment. 

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is related to the boolean array masking and assignment operation. The bug occurs because the `putmask` function is not handling the boolean array indexing correctly when the dtype is specified as "string" or any other non-numeric type.

To fix this bug, the `putmask` function needs to handle the boolean array indexing and assignment differently for non-numeric dtypes such as "string" or other nullable types. The dtype should be taken into consideration when performing the assignment operation.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `putmask` function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    """
    See Block.putmask.__doc__
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)

    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == len(mask):
        new = new[mask]

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    if is_string_dtype(self.values):
        # Handle string or non-numeric dtype differently
        new_values[mask] = new.astype(str)
    else:
        new_values[mask] = new

    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, a check is performed to determine if the dtype of the values is a string or non-numeric type. If so, the assignment operation handles the string dtype appropriately by casting the `new` values to strings before assigning them to `new_values` using boolean array indexing. This ensures that the assignment operation is compatible with non-numeric dtypes.

With this fix, the `putmask` function should now work correctly for all dtypes, including string and other non-numeric dtypes.
