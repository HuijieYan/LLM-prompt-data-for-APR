The error message "ValueError: NumPy boolean array indexing assignment cannot assign 3 input values to the 1 output values where the mask is true" suggests that there is a mismatch in the number of input values and the number of output values during boolean array indexing assignment.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
new_values[mask] = new
```
This line is trying to assign the values of 'new' to 'new_values' based on the boolean array mask.

The bug occurs due to the mismatch in the number of elements in 'new' and the number of True values in the mask. This mismatch causes the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the code should check the length of 'new' and handle the assignment based on the condition when the length of 'new' is not equal to the number of True values in the mask.

Below is the corrected code for the 'putmask' function:

```python
def putmask(
    self, mask, new, inplace: bool = False, axis: int = 0, transpose: bool = False,
) -> List["Block"]:
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
    mask = _extract_bool_array(mask)
    new_values = self.values if inplace else self.values.copy()

    if isinstance(new, np.ndarray) and len(new) == np.sum(mask):
        new = new[mask]
    elif len(new) == 1:
        new = np.array([new[0]]*np.sum(mask))

    mask = _safe_reshape(mask, new_values.shape)

    new_values[mask] = new
    return [self.make_block(values=new_values)]
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if the length of 'new' is equal to 1. If true, it creates a new array with the same value repeated for the number of True values in the mask.

This modification ensures that the boolean array indexing assignment has a matching number of input and output values, thereby fixing the bug.
