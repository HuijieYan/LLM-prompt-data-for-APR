Potential error location: 
The bug occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function when the `if` conditions are checked to determine the type of the `target` variable. The bug occurs at the line `elif self.is_all_dates:` where the intention is to check if the `target` is of type `datetime` but due to missing parentheses, the `is_all_dates` function is not being called and instead is being treated as an attribute.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `is_all_dates` function is supposed to be called with parentheses to invoke it as a method, but the code is missing the parentheses. As a result, the condition will always be truthy because the function itself is being checked as a truthy attribute.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by properly calling the `self.is_all_dates()` function with parentheses to properly check if the `target` is of type `datetime`.

Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
