The bug seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `Index` class. The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable" indicates that somewhere in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method, a variable that is expected to be iterable (e.g., a list or array) is actually assigned a value of type `None`.

The bug may be caused by the `tgt_values` variable being assigned a value of `None` instead of the expected array-like object. This could be happening due to a conditional branch of the code resulting in `tgt_values` being assigned the value `None`.

One approach to fixing this bug could be to add additional checks to ensure that `tgt_values` is properly assigned a valid value before passing it to `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique`. Additionally, it may be necessary to carefully review the conditional statements and variable assignments within the `get_indexer_non_unique` method to ensure that the correct paths are followed.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif issubclass(target.dtype.type, np.datetime64):
        tgt_values = target.astype('int64')
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking if `target` contains datetime values has been updated to use `issubclass(target.dtype.type, np.datetime64)` and `target.astype('int64')` to convert such values to an array of integers. This should address the issue with the non-unique datetime index and resolve the bug.
