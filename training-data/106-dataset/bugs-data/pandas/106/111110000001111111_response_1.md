The bug occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function of the `Index` class. When dropping columns from a DataFrame with a non-unique DatetimeIndex, the error message generated by the `get_indexer_non_unique` function is confusing and misleading.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements that determine the type of `target` and `self` before calling `get_indexer_non_unique`. The bug appears to stem from the mishandling of conditions related to different types of index objects.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional checks for the type of target and self were not executed correctly. This led to calling `get_indexer_non_unique` with the wrong type of input, resulting in a misleading error message.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the type of `target` and `self` before calling `get_indexer_non_unique`. We must ensure that the correct type-specific operations are performed based on the type of the input index objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if isinstance(ptarget, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif pself.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target.values
    
    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, we use `isinstance` checks to determine the type of `ptarget` and perform type-specific operations accordingly. Additionally, we call the `asi8` or `values` method to get the values from the target index, depending on its type.

This fix ensures that the correct type-specific operations are performed based on the type of the input index objects, preventing the misleading error message that occurred previously.
