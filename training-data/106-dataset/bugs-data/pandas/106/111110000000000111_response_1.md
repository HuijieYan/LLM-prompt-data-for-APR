Potential error location: The error occurs when the `get_indexer_non_unique` function is called with non-unique datetime index.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling non-unique datetime index properly, resulting in a TypeError when trying to iterate over a NoneType object.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The function needs to handle non-unique datetime index properly and handle the NoneType object to prevent the TypeError.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine().get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, the `is_all_dates` function is called as a method (adding parentheses to call it as a method) and the `_engine` function is also called as a method (adding parentheses to call it as a method). This ensures that the necessary behavior is properly invoked when handling non-unique datetime index and prevents the TypeError from occurring.
