The issue that is being faced in the reported bug is due to a problem with the `get_indexer_non_unique` method in the `Index` class. When a non-unique DatetimeIndex is passed, and the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is called without specifying the columns or axis, it leads to a wrong error and a very confusing error message. This occurs due to improper handling of the `tgt_values` variable and the `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique` method call.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the handling of `tgt_values` and the subsequent call to `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique`. This leads to the TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

The bug occurs because the functionality of the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is not consistent with the requirements of a non-unique DatetimeIndex, leading to an inappropriate error message. The `tgt_values` is not being assigned a proper value, causing issues during the subsequent `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique` method call.

To fix the bug, the `tgt_values` should be assigned the correct values based on the input `target` and the type of index. Additionally, the logic for handling non-unique DatetimeIndex should be updated to ensure proper execution of the `get_indexer_non_unique` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` method in the `Index` class:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif pself.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = pself._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In this corrected code:
1. Proper handling of `tgt_values` is implemented based on the type of index and input `target`.
2. A check for `is_all_dates` is performed on `pself` instead of `target` to ensure the correct behavior for non-unique DatetimeIndex.
3. The method call to `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique` is made using `pself` to ensure the correct execution.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the `get_indexer_non_unique` method behaves as expected, providing the correct error message and handling non-unique DatetimeIndex appropriately.
