The bug occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function of the `DatetimeIndex` class. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique` call, as it results in a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` error.

The potential error location is within the `get_indexer_non_unique` function, where it tries to access the `self._engine` attribute and calls its `get_indexer_non_unique` method.

The bug occurs because the `self._engine` attribute is not properly initialized, resulting in a `NoneType` object and causing the subsequent `get_indexer_non_unique` method call to fail.

To fix the bug, the `self._engine` attribute should be properly initialized before calling its `get_indexer_non_unique` method. Additionally, the condition for checking if `target` is categorical or if it contains all dates should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif ptarget.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = ptarget.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = ptarget._ndarray_values

    if self._engine is not None:
        indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
    else:
        raise Exception("Engine attribute is not properly initialized")
```

In the corrected code, the `self._engine` attribute is properly checked before its method is called. If it is not `None`, the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is called as before. Otherwise, an exception is raised to indicate that the engine attribute is not properly initialized.
