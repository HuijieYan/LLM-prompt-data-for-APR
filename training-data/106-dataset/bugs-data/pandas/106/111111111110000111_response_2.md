Based on the error message, the bug is occurring in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `Index` class. The error indicates that a 'NoneType' object is not iterable, which suggests there might be an issue with the `tgt_values` being assigned as 'None' in the method.

The bug is occurring because for the condition `elif self.is_all_dates:` the code should access the `asi8` method which is currently missing parentheses. Additionally, the `_engine` method is also missing parentheses.

To fix the bug, the method `get_indexer_non_unique` should be updated as follows:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine()
    return indexer, missing
```

By making these changes, the bug should be fixed and the function should work as intended.
