The potential error in the code is with the `@Appender` decorator. This decorator is not a standard Python decorator, so it's likely a custom decorator specific to the codebase where this function is used.

The error occurs because the `@Appender` decorator is not recognized, and it's not clear what it's supposed to do. This decorator does not seem to be a standard Python decorator, and without the definition of the `Appender` decorator, it's hard to determine the exact purpose of this decorator.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to define the `Appender` decorator or replace it with a standard Python decorator that fits the purpose of the function.

Here's the corrected code assuming the `Appender` decorator is meant to be a custom decorator:

```python
def Appender(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Additional logic can be added here if needed
        return result
    return wrapper

@Appender
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, we define a simple `Appender` decorator that takes a function and returns a wrapper function that calls the original function and returns its result. This assumes that the purpose of `Appender` is to modify the behavior of the `get_indexer_non_unique` function or add additional functionality to it.
