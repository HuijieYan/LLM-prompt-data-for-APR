The buggy function `get_indexer_non_unique` is intended to return the indexer values and the missing values based on the target input. However, there seems to be a bug in the code related to how the self and target objects are handled.

The bug occurs when checking if the target object is categorical or if it consists of all dates. The code incorrectly handles the cases for "is_all_dates" and the "_engine" attribute, resulting in incorrect values for the indexer and missing arrays.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for checking if the target is categorical or if it consists of all dates. Additionally, we need to ensure the correct handling of the self and pself attributes.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if is_categorical(ptarget):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(ptarget)
    elif ptarget.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = ptarget.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = ptarget._ndarray_values
    
    indexer, missing = pself._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `ptarget` to handle the categorical and "is_all_dates" checks as it represents the target after potential promotion.
- We use `ptarget.is_all_dates()` instead of `self.is_all_dates`.
- We use `ptarget` and `pself` to call the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique` function to ensure that the correct values are obtained based on the potential promotion of the target.

These corrections should address the bug and ensure that the `get_indexer_non_unique` function behaves as expected.
