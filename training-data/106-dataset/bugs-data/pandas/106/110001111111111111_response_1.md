The error occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function. The bug seems to be due to the wrong assignment of `tgt_values` and the wrong usage of the `is_all_dates` attribute. Also, it appears that the variable `self` should refer to an object of the `DatetimeIndex` class, and not just the values in the variable `pself`.

To fix this bug, the `tgt_values` should be assigned based on the type of the `target` variable and the usage of `is_all_dates` should be corrected. Based on the code context, it seems that `is_all_dates` should be called as a method, not a property.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif target.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values()

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
   ```
