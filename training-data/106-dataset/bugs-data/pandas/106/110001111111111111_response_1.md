Potential error location: 
The error occurs in the `get_indexer_non_unique` function when attempting to execute the line `stargets = set(targets)`, leading to a TypeError due to a `NoneType` object being used in an iterable context.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer_non_unique` function is trying to set the variable `stargets` to a set of `targets`, but `targets` is a `NoneType` object, leading to a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self._engine` is not None before trying to call `get_indexer_non_unique` on it.
2. Handle the case where `self._engine` is `None` and `targets` is `None` before trying to set `stargets`.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    if self._engine is not None:
        target = ensure_index(target)
        pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
        if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
            return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

        if is_categorical(target):
            tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
        elif self.is_all_dates:
            tgt_values = target.asi8
        else:
            tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

        indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
    else:
        raise TypeError("Engine is None. Cannot get indexer non-unique.")
```
In this corrected code, we have added a check for `self._engine` not being `None` before trying to call `get_indexer_non_unique` on it. If it is `None`, a `TypeError` is raised to handle this case.
