Analysis:
The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable" suggests that there is an issue with the iteration or looping over a NoneType object, which is usually encountered when trying to iterate over a variable that is None.

Error Location:
The error is likely to be occurring in the following line:
```python
indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
```

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message indicates that the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique()` method is returning a NoneType object, causing the TypeError when trying to iterate over it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique()` method always returns a valid iterable object to avoid the NoneType error.
2. Check for any conditions in the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique()` method that might result in a NoneType object and handle those cases appropriately.
3. Validate the input data and ensure that it is in the expected format to avoid issues when passed to the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique()` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)

    if indexer is not None:  # Check for NoneType and handle appropriately
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing  # Assuming missing is already defined
    else:
        return None  # Or handle the NoneType error condition as per the requirement
```
In the corrected code, the NoneType error condition is handled by checking if the `indexer` is not None before returning its value. This prevents the TypeError from occurring and provides a more controlled workflow for handling potential NoneType responses from the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique()` method.
