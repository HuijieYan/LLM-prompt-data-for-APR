Potential error location: The error occurs in the get_indexer_non_unique function, specifically in the line where tgt_values is assigned based on certain conditions. This suggests that the bug might be related to how the tgt_values variable is being assigned or used.

Reasons behind the bug occurrence: The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the target variable. It fails to properly assign the tgt_values, leading to a TypeError when trying to use the tgt_values variable later in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It is important to ensure that the target variable is properly handled and that the tgt_values variable is correctly assigned based on the conditions provided. Proper error checking and input validation should also be included to prevent similar issues in the future.

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif target.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In this corrected version, the issue related to tgt_values has been addressed. Now, tgt_values is assigned based on the conditions provided, and appropriate methods like asi8() are called. Proper error handling and input validation are not directly included here but should be considered as part of the overall code implementation.
