The buggy function is `get_indexer_non_unique` in the `Index` class. The function attempts to determine the indexer and missing values for non-unique targets based on the inputs provided.

The bug occurs when checking for `is_all_dates` in the `self` instance. Although `self.is_all_dates` is intended to return a boolean value, it is not being called as a function. This leads to issues when checking for this condition.

To fix the bug, the function `is_all_dates` should be called as a function (`self.is_all_dates()`) to return the boolean value. Additionally, `target.asi8` should also be called as a function to return the integer representation of the target when `self.is_all_dates()` is true.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

By invoking the functions `self.is_all_dates()` and `target.asi8()`, we ensure that the correct values are returned based on the conditions, fixing the bug that caused the incorrect behavior in the function.
