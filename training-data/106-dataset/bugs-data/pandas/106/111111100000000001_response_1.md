Potential error:
The code calls `is_categorical(target)` and `self.is_all_dates` without parentheses, which means it is not actually calling these methods and instead just referencing them as attributes. This will cause the code to not work as intended.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurred because the code is trying to call `is_categorical(target)` and `self.is_all_dates` as functions, but they are actually implemented as methods, so they should be called with parentheses.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by calling `is_categorical(target)` and `self.is_all_dates()` with parentheses. This will correctly invoke these methods and ensure that the code works as intended.

Corrected code:
```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if self.is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values
    
    indexer, missing = self._engine().get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
