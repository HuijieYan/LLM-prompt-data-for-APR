The potential error in the provided code is that the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is defined twice in the same file, which is not allowed in Python. This is causing a conflict and resulting in a bug.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_indexer_non_unique` method is being defined multiple times, which leads to a conflict and prevents the correct usage of the method.

To fix the bug, the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer_non_unique` method should be removed, and the method should be defined only once with the correct implementation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_106/pandas/core/indexes/base.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def ensure_index(index_like, copy=False):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def asi8(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _engine(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def is_categorical(self) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def is_all_dates(self) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _maybe_promote(self, other):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected get_indexer_non_unique method
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
