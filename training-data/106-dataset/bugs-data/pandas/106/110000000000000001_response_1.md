Potential error location: The error could potentially be in the use of the Appender decorator as it is not a built-in decorator in Python.

Reasons behind the bug: The use of the Appender decorator is not standard in Python, and it seems to be a custom decorator that is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, there is a reference to `_index_shared_docs` and `_index_doc_kwargs` which are not defined in the provided code snippet.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `@Appender` decorator and directly define the function as a method of a class.
2. If the `@Appender` decorator is necessary, define it properly in the code where it is being used.
3. Ensure that `_index_shared_docs` and `_index_doc_kwargs` are defined and accessible within the context of the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
