The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method of the `Index` class. The error message is a `TypeError` related to the fact that a 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

The root cause of this bug seems to be the mishandling of the `target` object in the `get_indexer_non_unique` method. 

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add conditionals to check for the type of `target` and handle it accordingly before calling the `_engine.get_indexer_non_unique` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif target.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values
    
    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional to check if `target` is of categorical type, and if not, we ensure that it is all dates. We also fixed a mistake where `target.asi8` should be called as a method rather than as an attribute. Additionally, we added brackets to `target.is_all_dates()` to call the method.
