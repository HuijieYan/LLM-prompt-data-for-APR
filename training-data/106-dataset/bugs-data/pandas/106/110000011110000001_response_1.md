The error occurs when the test case 'test_drop_with_non_unique_datetime_index_and_invalid_keys' tries to drop labels 'a' and 'b' from the DataFrame. This results in a TypeError related to 'stargets' being set to 'NoneType'.

The potential error location is the 'get_indexer_non_unique' method where 'stargets' is being set.

The reason behind the bug is that 'stargets' is not being defined before it is being set to 'set(targets)'. This means that 'targets' is likely not being passed into the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that 'targets' is being properly passed into the 'get_indexer_non_unique' method.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target, **kwargs):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget, **kwargs)

    if is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates:
        tgt_values = target.asi8
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values, **kwargs)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
