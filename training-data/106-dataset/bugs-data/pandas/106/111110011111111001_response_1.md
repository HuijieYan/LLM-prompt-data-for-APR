The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to iterate over a `NoneType` object, which is most likely caused by an incorrect handling of the `targets` variable or its related data structures.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the function `get_indexer_non_unique` and specifically the assignment and handling of the `target` and `tgt_values` variables. It seems that the `tgt_values` variable or the handling after its assignment might be leading to the `TypeError`.

The bug likely occurred due to incorrect assignment or handling of the `tgt_values` variable. When trying to iterate over this variable or use it in another context, the `TypeError` occurred as it was a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, the `tgt_values` variable should be assigned a value that is not `None` and is iterable. This could involve revisiting the conditionals that define the value of `tgt_values` and making sure that it is appropriately assigned based on the conditions.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer_non_unique` function:

```python
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
        target = ensure_index(target)
        pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
        if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
            return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)
    
        if is_categorical(target):
            tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
        elif self.is_all_dates():
            tgt_values = target.to_numpy()
        else:
            tgt_values = target._ndarray_values
    
        indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```

In the corrected code, the correction has been applied to the part where `tgt_values` is assigned a value. The `is_all_dates` method is now called as a function for checking the condition, and the `tgt_values` assignment for dates has been updated to `target.to_numpy()`. These changes should ensure that the `tgt_values` variable is assigned a proper value and avoid the `TypeError` that occurred.
