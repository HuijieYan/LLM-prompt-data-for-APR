The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over a `NoneType` object, specifically in the `stargets = set(targets)` line. This suggests that the `targets` variable is `None`, leading to the error.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer_non_unique` function is when checking if `is_categorical(target)` is true. If so, `tgt_values` is assigned with `np.asarray(target)`. Otherwise, it assigns `tgt_values` based on checks for `self.is_all_dates` and the default case. 

The buggy part of the code is that `is_categorical` and `self.is_all_dates` are missing function call parentheses. Thus, they are being treated as properties rather than being called as functions. As a result, the conditions are not evaluated as intended, leading to incorrect assignments for `tgt_values` and the subsequent error when `tgt_values` is used. 

To fix the issue, these conditions should be called as functions to retrieve their boolean values.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer_non_unique"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target):
    target = ensure_index(target)
    pself, ptarget = self._maybe_promote(target)
    if pself is not self or ptarget is not target:
        return pself.get_indexer_non_unique(ptarget)

    if self.is_categorical(target):
        tgt_values = np.asarray(target)
    elif self.is_all_dates():
        tgt_values = target.asi8()
    else:
        tgt_values = target._ndarray_values

    indexer, missing = self._engine.get_indexer_non_unique(tgt_values)
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer), missing
```
