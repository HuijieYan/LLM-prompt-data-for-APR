The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. The error is occurring because `isna` and `com` methods are not defined within the context of the function.

The bug occurred because the `isna` and `com` methods are being called without the appropriate context or reference. To fix this bug, we need to use the appropriate reference for the `isna` method and ensure that the `com` method is being called with the correct reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = data.isna()  # using data reference for isna method
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
