The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" indicates that there is an issue with reindexing due to a duplicate axis. This is likely happening in the `pct_change` function, specifically during the `reindex_like` step. When `reindex_like` is called, it tries to reindex based on the same index as the original object. This could lead to a duplicate axis issue.

To fix this bug, the reindexing process should use a unique index to avoid the duplicate axis error. One possible approach is to explicitly specify the desired frequency (business month frequency in this case) and then calculate the percentage change. Another approach is to handle potential duplicate axis scenarios within the `pct_change` function itself by checking for duplicate axes before reindexing.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    if freq is not None:
        data = data.asfreq(freq)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs[mask] = np.nan

    return rs
```

In this correction, `asfreq` is used to ensure the data has the desired frequency before calculating the percentage change. Additionally, `isna` is used to check for NaN values instead of `com.values_from_object(data)` which is not defined in the given code. The corrected method should handle the frequency and reindexing issues more robustly.
