The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" suggests that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis in the pct_change function.

The problem seems to be with the reindexing operation on the resulting series (rs) in the pct_change method. It looks like the reindexing operation is causing the ValueError due to a duplicate axis.

The issue is occurring because the rs series is being reindexed with the same index as the original data series, leading to a duplicate axis.

To fix this issue, one approach could be to reset the index of the rs series before reindexing it to avoid creating a duplicate axis. Additionally, any other reindexing operations within this method also need to be checked for similar issues.

Below is the corrected code for the pct_change method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)  # Reset the index to avoid duplicate axis
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the rs series is reset before reindexing to prevent the creation of a duplicate axis. This fix should resolve the ValueError caused by reindexing from a duplicate axis.
