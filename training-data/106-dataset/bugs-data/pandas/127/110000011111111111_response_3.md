The error occurs at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` which is causing a ValueError with the message "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis". This means that the `rs` Series is trying to reindex with the same dates multiple times.

The bug is occurring because `rs` is being created with a frequency that is different from the original index. When `periods=1` and `freq="B"` are passed to `data.shift()`, it adds an extra row with the same date (2019-11-18 in this case) causing a duplicate index.

To fix this, we can remove the unnecessary `freq` argument from the `data.shift()` method. 

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By removing the `freq` argument from `data.shift()`, we prevent the creation of duplicate indices, and the function should now work as expected.
