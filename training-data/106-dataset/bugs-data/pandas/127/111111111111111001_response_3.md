The bug occurred because the `reindex_like` function is trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates. This happened because the `pct_change` method is trying to reindex `rs` to `data`, and since `data` is a Series with a DatetimeIndex, the reindexing resulted in duplicate axes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `pct_change` method to use the `reindex` method directly with the index of `data`. This will ensure that the reindexing does not result in duplicate axes.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.reindex(index=data.index)
        if freq is None:
            mask = self.isna()  # changed 'isna' to 'self.isna()'
            rs = rs.mask(mask)
        return rs
```

In this corrected code:
- We replaced `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` with `rs = rs.reindex(index=data.index)`.
- We also replaced `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))` with `mask = self.isna()` and `np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)` with `rs = rs.mask(mask)`.

These changes ensure that reindexing is done using the index of `data` without causing duplicate axes, and fixes other method invocations to use the correct context.
