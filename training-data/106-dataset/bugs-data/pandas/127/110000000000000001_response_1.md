Potential Error:
The potential error in this function is with the `div` and `shift` methods. There seems to be a syntax error in how these methods are being called, as the parameters are not being passed correctly.

Reason for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `div` and `shift` methods are not being called correctly. The parameters are being passed in an incorrect format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to correct the syntax used for calling the `div` and `shift` methods by passing the parameters in the correct format.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.core.common import isna

# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
