The bug is likely occurring in the `pct_change` function of the `NDFrame` class. The function attempts to calculate the percentage change at a particular frequency (`BM`), but the usage of `reindex_like` within the function is causing a ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis.

This error occurs because the `reindex_like` method is trying to reindex the result with the original data, which can lead to a duplicate axis when the data contains duplicate indices. This is likely due to the resampling at business month end (`BM`) frequency, which may introduce duplicate indices.

To fix this bug, the `reindex_like` method needs to be replaced with `reindex` to avoid potential duplicate indices. Additionally, the usage of frequency for percentage change in the context of the provided test case seems incorrect, so it should be removed.

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    if 'freq' in kwargs:
        del kwargs['freq']
    return rs
```

This fixed function removes the `reindex_like` method and adjusts the calculation to remove the use of `freq`. The `reindex` method is no longer required.
