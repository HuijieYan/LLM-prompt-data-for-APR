Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the calculation of rs, where the rs dataframe is reindexed and then NaN values are assigned based on a mask.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the reindexing of the rs dataframe is causing issues when the frequency is set to 'BM'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the asfreq function to convert the datetime index to the specified frequency before calculating the percentage change.
2. Handle the reindexing and NaN assignment in a different way that is not affected by the frequency setting.

Corrected Code:
```python
    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        
        if freq is not None:
            data = data.asfreq(freq)
        
        shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, axis=axis, **kwargs)
        rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
        if freq is None:
            mask = rs.isna()
            rs[mask] = np.nan
        return rs
```
