1. The test case is trying to use the `pct_change` method on a Series with a frequency set as 'B', which is causing an error related to reindexing from a duplicate axis.

2. The potential error location within the `pct_change` method is in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This is likely where the reindexing from a duplicate axis is occurring.

3. A potential reason for the bug could be related to the handling of reindexing in the `pct_change` method. It seems that when the frequency is set, the reindexing process is causing issues with the duplicate axis.

4. One approach to fixing the bug could be to ensure that the reindexing process handles duplicate axis appropriately. This could involve modifying the logic for reindexing and possibly avoiding the reindexing from a duplicate axis when the frequency is set.

5. Corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        if freq:
            rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=fill_method, limit=limit)
        else:
            rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
            if freq is None:
                mask = rs.isna()
                rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```

In the corrected code, a check for the presence of a frequency is added, and based on that, the appropriate logic for calculating the percentage change is performed. This approach avoids the reindexing from a duplicate axis when the frequency is set.
