The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" in the test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` from the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_127/pandas/tests/series/test_timeseries.py` indicates that the `pct_change` function in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_127/pandas/core/generic.py` is trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates, leading to the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function `pct_change` is the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This line is attempting to reindex `rs` with the index from `data`, and it's likely causing the "duplicate axis" error.

The bug occurs because the `pct_change` function is trying to reindex the result with the same index as the original data, and there are duplicate indices present.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to create a new index for the result of the percentage change calculation that does not have duplicate entries. This can be achieved by resetting the index and then performing the percentage change calculation. After the calculation is done, the index can be set back to the original index.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    # Reset the index to avoid duplicate axis errors
    rs = rs.reset_index(drop=True)

    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)

    # Set the index back to the original index
    rs.index = self.index
    return rs
```

This corrected code adjusts the `pct_change` function to reset the index to avoid duplicate entries, and then sets the index back to the original index after the percentage change calculation is done.
