The error is occurring in the 'pct_change' function when the 'freq' parameter is set to 'BM' (business month end frequency). The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" suggests that there are duplicate values in the index after applying the 'pct_change' method with the 'BM' frequency.

The potential error location in the 'pct_change' function is at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`, where it tries to reindex the result to match the original data index.

The bug occurs because when the frequency is set to 'BM', it might create duplicate indices, and when 'reindex_like' method is called, it throws the value error due to the duplicate indices.

To fix the bug, we should first resample the data to business month end frequency ('BM') and then apply the 'pct_change' method. We should also drop any duplicate indices after resampling.

Here's the corrected code for the 'pct_change' function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    if freq is not None:
        data = data.resample(freq).asfreq()
    
    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, **kwargs)
    return rs
```

By applying the 'resample' method before calculating the 'pct_change', we can ensure that the index does not have duplicate values, avoiding the "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" that was previously occurring when using the 'pct_change' function with the 'BM' frequency.
