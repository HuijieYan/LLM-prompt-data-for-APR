Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1`. 
The code is attempting to divide the DataFrame 'data' by 'data.shift', but it's not clear if this is the intended operation, especially with the presence of the shift parameter.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect usage of the `shift` method, which might not be providing the expected output. Additionally, there is no clear indication of what the `isna`, `com.values_from_object`, and `np.putmask` functions are supposed to do, which might lead to unexpected results or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic behind the `shift` method to ensure it is used correctly and providing the desired output.
2. Check the purpose of the `isna`, `com.values_from_object`, and `np.putmask` functions to understand their role in the code and make necessary adjustments.
3. Verify if the `div` method is the correct operation to be performed on 'data' and 'data.shift', and consider using appropriate methods for the desired computation.

Corrected Code:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / shifted_data
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    return rs
```
In the corrected code, the division operation has been replaced with subtraction and division separately to compute the percentage change, and the use of `isna`, `com.values_from_object`, and `np.putmask` functions has been addressed.
