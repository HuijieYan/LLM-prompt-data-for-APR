The error in the provided code is likely occurring due to the `reindex_like` function used within the `pct_change` method. The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" indicates that there might be duplicate values in the index which cannot be reindexed.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `pct_change` function to use `asfreq` method with 'BM' frequency instead of using `reindex_like`. This will correctly handle the frequency conversion and avoid the duplicate axis issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if freq is not None:
        data = data.asfreq(freq)

    shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted) - 1
    
    return rs
```

This modified code uses `asfreq` to handle the frequency conversion and avoids the use of `reindex_like`, which was causing the issue.
