The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" suggests that the issue lies within the `reindex_like` function, which is called within the `pct_change` method. This error occurs when the `reindex_like` function tries to reindex on an axis with duplicates, which is not allowed.

The bug occurs because it is trying to reindex the data with an index that contains duplicate entries, which is not supported.

To fix this bug, we can update the `pct_change` method to use a different approach for reindexing. Specifically, we can add a step to remove duplicate entries in the index before performing the reindexing. This will ensure that the reindexing is performed on a unique index, addressing the ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `pct_change`:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    
    # Remove duplicate entries in index before reindexing
    data = data[~data.index.duplicated(keep='first')]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the index of the DataFrame `data` is de-duplicated before the `reindex_like` operation. This ensures that reindexing is performed on a unique index, which resolves the ValueError.
