    """
    Percentage change between the current and a prior element.
    Computes percentage change between the current and a prior element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    periods : int, default 1
        Periods to shift for forming percent change.
    fill_method : str, default 'pad'
        How to handle NAs before computing percent changes.
    limit : int, default None
        The number of consecutive NAs to fill before stopping.
    freq : DateOffset, Timedelta or offset alias string
        Increment to use from time series like data to adjust the periods.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments are not used at the moment.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        The percent changes.

    See Also
    --------
    Series.pct_change : Percentage change between the current and a prior element.
    
    Notes
    -----
    By default, the percentage change is calculated over the previous row.
    If freq is specified, the percentage change is calculated for the same period of the next or
    previous freq.
