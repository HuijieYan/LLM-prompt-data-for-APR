The error occurs at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` in the `pct_change` function. The error message indicates that it is not possible to reindex from a duplicate axis.

The reason behind the bug is that the reindexing process is trying to use an integer indexer on an axis with duplicates, which is not allowed. This causes the ValueError to be raised.

To fix the bug, the `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` line needs to be removed. Instead, the `pct_change` function should return the `rs` series directly without attempting to reindex it. This will prevent the ValueError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    return rs
```

This fix removes the reindexing step and returns the `rs` series directly.
