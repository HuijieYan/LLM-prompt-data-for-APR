The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis when calling the `pct_change` function with the frequency set as 'BM' (business month end frequency).

The potential error location within the problematic function is the reindexing process using the `reindex_like` and `isna` functions.

The bug occurs because the `reindex_like` method tries to reindex the result Series to match the original data, but the result Series may have duplicate indices, leading to the "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `pct_change` function to check for duplicate indices in the result Series and handle them appropriately. This can be done by refining the reindexing logic to account for duplicate indices and avoid the "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    # Handle duplicate indices
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
In the corrected code, after calculating the percentage change, we use the `loc` method to remove any duplicate indices in the result Series. This prevents the "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error and ensures that the function returns the expected output.
