The buggy function 'pct_change' is expected to compute the percentage change for each period. The error message "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" suggests that there is a duplicate axis present, which could be causing the reindexing issue.

The potential error location within the problematic 'pct_change' function is when it tries to reindex the computed percentage change values using the original data's index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the reindexing process using the original data's index might not handle the duplicate axis correctly.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to reindex the computed percentage change values using a unique index, such as the frequency-based index obtained by using the `asfreq` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic 'pct_change' function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data.asfreq(freq))  # Reindex using the frequency-based index
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
