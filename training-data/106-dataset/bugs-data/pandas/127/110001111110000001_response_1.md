The test case provided is trying to call the `pct_change` method on a Series, passing the `freq` parameter as "B". The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing on an axis with duplicates.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `reindex_like` method, where the `rs` variable is being reindexed like the `data` variable. This is where the error is occurring, as the reindexing is causing a ValueError due to duplicate axis.

The reason for the bug occurring is that the `reindex_like` method is trying to reindex `rs` to be like `data`, but `rs` contains duplicate values that are causing the reindexing to fail.

To fix this bug, one approach is to not perform reindexing in the `pct_change` method. Since the `rs` variable is the result of a division and subtraction operation based on shifting values, reindexing may not be necessary for the logic of the `pct_change` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
