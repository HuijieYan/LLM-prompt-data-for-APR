The error occurs when the `reindex_like` function is called inside the `pct_change` method. The `reindex_like` function is trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates, which is causing the ValueError: "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis".

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the datetime index. The `reindex_like` function is trying to reindex on the datetime index, which has duplicates due to the frequency set to "B" (business day). This is conflicting with the `DatetimeIndex` requirements of uniqueness.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `pct_change` method to handle the datetime index properly and avoid the conflict with duplicates.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)  # Modified to use value instead of method

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()  # Modified to use rs instead of com.values_from_object(data)
        rs[mask] = np.nan  # Modified to use numpy array notation for masking
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, we modified the `fillna` function to use `value` instead of `method`, as it appears that the original code incorrectly used `method`. Additionally, we modified the `mask` statement to correctly use `rs` instead of `com.values_from_object(data)`, and to use numpy array notation for masking. These changes should address the issue with reindexing on an axis with duplicates.
