Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the `pct_change` method where the `isna` function is called without referencing it correctly. It should be referenced as `self.isna()` instead of just `isna`.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurred because the `isna` function is being called without referencing it correctly. Since it is a method of the class, it should be called using `self.isna()`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The bug can be fixed by referencing the `isna` function correctly as `self.isna()`.

Corrected Code:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(self._stat_axis_name)
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask.values, np.nan)
    return rs
```
