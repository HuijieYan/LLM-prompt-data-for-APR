The potential error in the function `pct_change` is likely to be in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` which is causing ValueError: "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis". 

The reason behind this bug is that there are duplicate values in the index being used for reindexing, causing the ValueError. When a Series is reindexed with an index containing duplicate elements, the operation will fail because it is ambiguous as to which value should be used.

To fix this bug, we can perform the following steps:
1. Ensure that the index used for reindexing is unique to avoid the ValueError.
2. Reindex the series using a unique index to avoid the duplicate axis error.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:
```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    unique_index = data.index.drop_duplicates()
    rs = rs.reindex(unique_index)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
In the corrected code, we use `unique_index` to reindex the series, which ensures that there are no duplicate axis issues. This should resolve the ValueError and allow the function to work as expected.
