The error message is "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis". This suggests that the problem is occurring when attempting to reindex with a duplicate axis. This likely arises from the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` within the `pct_change` function, as this is the point where reindexing with a duplicate axis might be occurring.

The reason for the bug is that the `reindex_like` method uses the `reindex` method internally, and the `reindex` method does not handle duplicate axis properly, which leads to the error.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to directly perform the logic to calculate the percentage change without utilizing the `reindex_like` method, as this is where the duplicate axis issue is arising. Another approach is to use the `groupby` method to handle duplicate axis values.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / shifted_data
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the reindexing operation has been completely removed, and the percentage change is calculated directly, avoiding the issue of duplicate axes that was causing the error.
