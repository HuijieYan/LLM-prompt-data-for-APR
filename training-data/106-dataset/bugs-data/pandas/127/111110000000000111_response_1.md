Error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `pct_change` function due to the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`, which is attempting to reindex the `rs` object to be like `data`. This reindexing operation is likely causing the "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis".

Reasons for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because when `freq` is set to 'BM' (end of month frequency), the reindexing operation in the `pct_change` function is causing issues with duplicated indices due to the resampling.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the reindexing operation should be replaced with resampling to the desired frequency instead of reindexing, and the processing should be revised to handle the 'BM' frequency correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
    # this is the corrected pct_change function
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

        if freq is not None:
            data = data.asfreq(freq)

        rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods)
        return rs
```
