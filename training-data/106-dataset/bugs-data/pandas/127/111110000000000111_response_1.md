The bug in the provided code is in the `pct_change` method. The issue seems to be related to the reindexing of the result with the original data after calculating the percentage change with a specific frequency ('BM' in this case). This is resulting in a "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" when the `pct_change` method is called with a frequency parameter.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`.

The root cause of the issue is that when `pct_change` is called with a frequency parameter, it calculates the percentage change with respect to that frequency. However, the reindexing of the result with the original data is causing issues, possibly due to the frequency misalignment.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of reindexing the result with the original data, directly return the result without reindexing, as the frequency parameter is already handled in the percentage change calculation.
2. Return the result with the frequency applied and let the user decide if they want to reindex the result afterwards or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By removing the reindexing step, the code now returns the result without causing the "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" when `pct_change` is called with a frequency parameter.
