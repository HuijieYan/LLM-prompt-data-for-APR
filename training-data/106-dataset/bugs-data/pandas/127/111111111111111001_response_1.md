Potential error location: The error occurs when the `pct_change` method is called on a Series object. The error seems to be related to reindexing issues when using the `pct_change` method with a specific frequency.

Reason for the bug: The bug might be caused by incorrect use of indexes and reindexing within the `pct_change` method, leading to a "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: In the `pct_change` method, we need to ensure that the reindexing process does not result in a duplicate axis. Additionally, handling the reindexing process with a specific frequency parameter might resolve the issue.

```python
# Corrected function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        # Fill missing values with specified method and limit
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, limit=limit)

    if freq is not None:
        # Handle frequency-based reindexing and calculation
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs.index = self.index
    else:
        # Perform normal pct_change calculations
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    return rs
