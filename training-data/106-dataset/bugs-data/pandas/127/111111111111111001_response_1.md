The error message 'cannot reindex from a duplicate axis' suggests that the bug is likely related to the reindexing process within the `pct_change` function. Based on the code and the error message, it seems that the issue arises from the use of `reindex_like` within the `pct_change` function. The `reindex_like` function is being used to reindex the result (`rs`) to match the index of the original data (`data`).

The error message indicates that the index of the result (`rs`) has duplicates, which is causing the reindexing to fail. This may be due to the shift operation or other operations that result in a non-unique index.

In order to fix the bug, a possible approach is to ensure that after performing the shift and other operations, the resulting index becomes unique before attempting to reindex. This could be done by using the set-like functions such as `drop_duplicates`.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is not None:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        # Ensure the index is unique
        rs = rs[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        if freq is None:
            mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
    else:
        data = self
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        # Ensure the index is unique
        rs = rs[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        if freq is None:
            mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```

In this corrected code, after performing the shift operation and other calculations, the `rs` object's index is filtered using `~rs.index.duplicated()` to ensure it is unique before returning the result.
