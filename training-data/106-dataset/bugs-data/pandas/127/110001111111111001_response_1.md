Potential Error Location: The error occurs at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` in the `pct_change` method of the problematic function.

Reasons for the Bug: The error message indicates that there is a duplicate axis when trying to reindex the series `rs` based on the index of the `data` series. This is likely due to the fact that the `pct_change` method does not handle duplicate axes properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: It's necessary to handle the case of duplicate axes properly to avoid the ValueError raised during reindexing. This can be done by ensuring that the reindex operation is performed correctly, taking into account the possibility of duplicate axes in the input data.

Corrected Code:
```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data, method='ffill')
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs.values[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the `reindex_like` method is modified to include the `method='ffill'` parameter which handles the possibility of duplicate axes during reindexing. Additionally, the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))` is changed to `mask = rs.isna()` to correctly handle the NaN values in the `rs` series. Lastly, the line `np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)` is modified to `rs.values[mask] = np.nan` to ensure proper assignment of NaN values based on the mask.
