Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line where `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))` due to the reference to `com` which is not defined within the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the variable `com` is referenced without being defined within the function, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

- Change `com.values_from_object(data)` to `self.values()` if `com` was supposed to be referencing the current object.
- If `com` was intended to reference a different object, such as a class attribute, it should be properly defined or passed as an argument to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()  # Assuming isna is a method of the current object
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
