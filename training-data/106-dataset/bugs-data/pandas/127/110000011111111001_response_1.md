The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing due to a duplicate axis. This could be happening because the `pct_change` method is adding duplicate entries to the index, causing issues with the reindexing operation.

The issue is likely occurring in the `pct_change` method when it calculates the return series (`rs`) and then tries to reindex it. The `common_idx` range created in the test case is the source of the duplicate axis, as the index contains duplicated values.

To fix the bug, the approach could be to remove the duplicate entries from the index before performing the reindexing operation. This can be achieved by calling `drop_duplicates()` on the index before reindexing the series.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.core.common import _shared_docs
from pandas.core.base import doc
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.missing import isna
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

@doc(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(data._values)
        np.putmask(rs._values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs

# Function to remove duplicates from the index before reindexing
def reindex_series(self, index, method=None, copy=True, level=None, fill_value= np.nan):
    unique_index = index.drop_duplicates()
    return self.reindex(index=unique_index, method=method, copy=copy, level=level, fill_value=fill_value)

# Monkey patching the reindex_series function to the Series class
pd.Series.reindex_like = reindex_series
```

The corrected code ensures that the index used during reindexing does not contain duplicate entries by calling `drop_duplicates()`. Additionally, we have defined a separate function `reindex_series` to handle reindexing, and then monkey patched it to the `Series` class using the `reindex_like` method.
