The bug is occurring in the `pct_change` method. The error "ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis" is likely due to the reindexing process in the pct_change method. The problem might arise from the reindexing in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This line is trying to reindex `rs` to match the index of `data`, but it might be causing issues due to duplicate values in the index.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the reindexing line and return the original `rs` without reindexing. This way, the duplicate index issue should be resolved.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method with the reindexing line removed:

```python
    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        return rs
```

By removing the reindexing line, we address the bug that was causing the ValueError related to the reindexing from a duplicate axis.

This fix should resolve the issue and provide the expected output for the `pct_change` method for time-series data with frequency set as 'BM'.
