The test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` is creating a Series from a range and then trying to calculate the percentage change using the `pct_change` function with the `freq` parameter set to "B" (business day). The expected result of the percentage change is also defined. The error message indicates that there is a problem with reindexing due to a duplicate axis.

The potential error location within the `pct_change` function is after the `rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1` line. The error seems to be occurring while trying to apply the `reindex_like` function on the result (`rs`) of the division operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the data is not properly aligned for reindexing, possibly due to the `freq` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data alignment and reindexing are done correctly. We can achieve this by modifying the logic that handles the `reindex_like` operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python

    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        shift_kw = {}
        if freq is not None:
            shift_kw['freq'] = freq
        data = self
        if fill_method is not None:
            data = data.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, **shift_kw)
        rs = data.div(shifted) - 1

        # Reindexing the result according to the method
        if fill_method == "pad":
            rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        else:
            rs = rs.reindex(data.index)

        # Handling NaN values
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs[mask] = np.nan

        return rs
``` 

In this corrected code, we modify the `pct_change` function to perform the reindexing of the result (`rs`) according to the fill_method. If the fill_method is "pad", we use the `reindex_like` method; otherwise, we reindex the result with the index of the original data. We also handle the NaN values within the result using boolean indexing to ensure proper representation of the result.
