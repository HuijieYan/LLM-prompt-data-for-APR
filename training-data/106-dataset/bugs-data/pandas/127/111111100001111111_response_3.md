3. The error occurs because the `rs` Series is being reindexed with a frequency 'D' instead of the expected frequency 'BM' in the `pct_change` function of the Pandas library.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to reindex the `rs` Series with the correct frequency, 'BM', before adjusting the mask.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data, method='pad', limit=limit, tolerance=None, copy=True)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
With this fix, the function should reindex the `rs` Series with the correct frequency 'BM' as expected.
