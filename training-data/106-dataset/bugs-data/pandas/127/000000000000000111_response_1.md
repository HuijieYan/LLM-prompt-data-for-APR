The issue is related to the `pct_change` function when using the `freq='BM'` parameter. The error message `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` indicates that there may be duplicate values in the index, causing problems with reindexing.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`, which may be causing issues with duplicate axis when the frequency is set to 'BM'.

The bug occurs because when using `freq='BM'`, the function attempts to reindex the result (`rs`) to be like the original data, but this may cause issues if the index contains duplicate values. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use `asfreq` method to resample the data to the specified frequency before calculating the percentage change.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if freq is not None:
        data = data.asfreq(freq)

    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, **kwargs)
    return rs
```

This corrected function modifies the workflow and directly uses the `pct_change` method on the data, applying the resampling to the specified frequency (`freq`) if it's provided. This should resolve the issue related to the `freq='BM'` parameter and the reindexing problem.
