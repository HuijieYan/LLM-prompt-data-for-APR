The test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` is trying to create a Series and then apply the `pct_change` method with the `freq` parameter set to "B". The actual result is compared to an expected result, and based on the error message, the `reindex` operation within the `pct_change` method is causing the problem.

The error message indicates that the `reindex` operation is trying to reindex on an axis with duplicates, leading to a ValueError. This implies that there are duplicate values in the index, causing issues with the reindexing.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the `pct_change` function to handle situations where the index contains duplicate values. This could involve using a different method for calculating percentage changes that is not sensitive to duplicate values in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if freq is not None:
        data = self.asfreq(freq, method=fill_method, limit=limit)
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = pd.isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the `asfreq` method is used to handle the frequency conversion and the `reindex` operations are removed, as they were causing the issue with duplicate values in the index. Additionally, the division operation (`div`) and subtraction operations to calculate the percentage change are performed directly on the data and the shifted data, without explicitly calling `reindex`.
