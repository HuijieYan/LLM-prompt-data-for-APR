The error message is not provided, but based on the variables and their types during the runtime, the potential issues in the `pct_change` function appear to be related to incorrect usage of method calls and attributes.

The variable `nest` is used within the `pct_change` method, but it is not defined. It seems to be a placeholder for `self` and should be replaced with `self`.

Additionally, `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` seems to be used incorrectly. It should be modified to `rs = rs.reindex_like(self)` to correctly reindex `rs` using the calling object's index.

Furthermore, it's unclear what `com.values_from_object(data)` refers to in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. Assuming it's related to the `data` variable, this line needs to be updated accordingly.

Finally, `mask` and `np.putmask` are used without being imported. They might be referring to `np.isnan` and `np.putmask` from NumPy library and should be imported if not done already.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(self)
    if freq is None:
        mask = np.isnan(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
