The provided test case does not produce any error message, so there is no error to fix in the function. However, we can see that the output data is not as expected, so we need to review and potentially revise the implementation of the "pct_change" function.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue might be related to the computation of the percentage change. The "data.div" and "data.shift" operations might not be producing the expected results, which results in incorrect percentage change values.

To fix this issue, we need to review the computation logic for percentage change and handle any potential edge cases or unexpected data scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the "pct_change" function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the percentage change
    data_shifted = self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq)
    rs = (self - data_shifted) / abs(data_shifted)
    
    # Reindex if necessary
    if freq is not None:
        rs = rs.reindex_like(self, method=None, limit=limit)
    
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the percentage change is calculated directly by subtracting the shifted data from the original data and then dividing by the absolute value of the shifted data. This approach ensures that the percentage change is calculated correctly. Additionally, the reindexing process has been modified to handle cases where a frequency is provided.
