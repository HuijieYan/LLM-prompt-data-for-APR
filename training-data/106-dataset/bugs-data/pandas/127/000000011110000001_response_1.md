The error message is indicating that there is an attempt to reindex a Pandas DataFrame with duplicate axis, which is causing a ValueError. This error occurs at the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` in the pct_change method.

The reason behind the bug is that when the data is shifted to calculate the percentage change, it results in an index that contains duplicates. This causes an issue when reindexing the result of the percentage change operation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the pct_change method to reindex the result using the unique index of the original data. This can be achieved using the `reindex` method with the `index` parameter set to `data.index`.

Here's the corrected code for the pct_change method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex(index=data.index)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By reindexing the result using the original data's index, we avoid the issue of duplicate axis and the ValueError that was occurring before.
