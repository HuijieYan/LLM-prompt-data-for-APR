The error occurs in the `pct_change` method of the `pandas.core.series.Series` class. The error message suggests that the problem is related to reindexing from a duplicate axis.

The `pct_change` method attempts to reindex the result using the `reindex_like` method, and the error occurs during this reindexing process.

The `reindex_like` method reindexes the result `rs` to match the index of `data`, but it seems that the index of `rs` contains duplicate entries, leading to the error "cannot reindex from a duplicate axis."

To fix this bug, we can modify the `pct_change` method to reindex the result without causing duplicate axis issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shifted) / shifted
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

This corrected code addresses the issue causing the error by directly calculating the percentage change without relying on `reindex_like`, which was causing the problem with duplicate indexing.
