The error occurs in the `pct_change` method in the reindexing step, causing a ValueError due to attempting to reindex on an axis with duplicates.

The reason for the bug is that when the `freq` parameter is set to 'BM', the data has some duplicate indexes, which causes the reindexing to fail.

To fix the bug, the reindexing step needs to be modified to handle the duplicate indexes appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is not None:
        new_index = self.index.asfreq(freq)
        rs = rs.reindex(new_index)

    mask = self.isna()
    rs[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, we first reindex the `rs` series with the new index obtained from `self.index.asfreq(freq)`. Then we directly use boolean indexing to assign `np.nan` to the positions where `rs` is `nan` in order to handle the duplicate indexes appropriately. This should fix the bug and make the `pct_change` method work as expected for the given test case.
