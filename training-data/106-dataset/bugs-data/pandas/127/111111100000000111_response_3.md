The issue here is with the `pct_change` method in the `NDFrame` class. The code is trying to calculate the percentage change of the DataFrame with a specific frequency (`freq='BM'`). The error message `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` suggests that there might be duplicate indices present in the DataFrame after applying the `pct_change` method.

It seems that the problem arises when the `pct_change` method tries to reindex the result back to the original DataFrame. This reindexing operation is causing the error due to duplicate indices.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `pct_change` method to directly return the result without attempting to reindex it to the original DataFrame. This will prevent the occurrence of duplicate indices and the associated error.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` method:

```python
# corrected pct_change method
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# ... omitted code ...

def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # extract the axis parameter from kwargs
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
  
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    # avoid reindexing to the original DataFrame to prevent duplicate indices
    return rs
```

By returning `rs` directly without attempting to reindex it back to the original DataFrame, we prevent the occurrence of duplicate indices and the associated error. This corrected method should resolve the issue with `pct_change` when using specific frequencies such as `'BM'`.
