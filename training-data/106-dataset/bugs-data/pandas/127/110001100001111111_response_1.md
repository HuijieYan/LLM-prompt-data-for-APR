The bug is likely in the pct_change function. The function appears to be using the wrong methods for div and shift, which could be causing the ValueError observed in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1` line is likely causing the issue. The rs variable is then operated on with reindex_like and np.putmask, which could be problematic.

To fix the bug, the div method should be called using the correct axis, and the shift method should also be used with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the pct_change function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Get the correct axis number
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))

    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        # Fill NaN values using the specified method and limit
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    # Calculate the percentage change using the correct axis
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    # Replace the NaN values
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)

    return rs
```
With these modifications, the error should be resolved, and the pct_change function should work as expected.
