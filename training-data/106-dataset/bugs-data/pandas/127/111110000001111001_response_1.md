It seems that the bug might be related to the use of the `div` function with the Series `data` and the `shift` function. Also, the function seems to use a mix of `self` and `cls` to refer to the instance of the class. This inconsistency might result in the bug.

The bug potentially occurs due to an incorrect usage of the `div` and `shift` functions and inconsistency in using `cls` and `self`.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function signature to use `self` consistently instead of mixing with `cls`.
2. Use the `div` and `shift` functions correctly with the `data` Series.
3. Make sure to define and initialize the variables `axis`, `data`, `rs`, and others to hold the desired values after the calculations within the function.

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, inplace=False, limit=limit)
        
    shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, fill_value=None)
    rs = data.div(shifted) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```
