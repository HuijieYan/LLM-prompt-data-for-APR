The bug seems to be related to the division by zero which results in inf and NaN values in the output. The issue may be occurring in the line `rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1`. Here, the `shift` method might not be handling the `freq` parameter as expected, leading to unexpected results in the division.

To fix the bug, we can modify the shift method to include the `freq` parameter appropriately. The `fillna` method can also be modified to ensure that NaN values are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    nonzero_values = data[data != 0]  # Exclude zero values to avoid division by zero
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / nonzero_values - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, we introduce a new variable `shifted_data` to store the result of the `shift` operation. We also exclude zero values from `data` to prevent division by zero, and calculate the percentage change using the corrected value.
