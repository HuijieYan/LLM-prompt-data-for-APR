The bug seems to be occurring within the `pct_change` method of the `NDFrame` class. The function is attempting to retrieve the axis number by calling the `_get_axis_number` method, but it passes incorrect arguments to that method.

The `self._get_axis_number` method should not be called directly, and it should not be provided as an argument to the `pct_change` method. Instead, the `self` object, which is an instance of `Series`, should provide the `axis` parameter directly, and the `pct_change` method should internally resolve the axis number.

To fix this bug, the `pct_change` method should directly use the `self` object to retrieve the axis number, and remove the `self._get_axis_number` call. The `axis` parameter should then be used internally within the `pct_change` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = getattr(self, "name", "index")  # Use the name attribute as the axis
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the `axis` is retrieved from the `self` object directly using `getattr(self, "name", "index")`. If the name attribute is not available, it defaults to "index". This resolves the issue and provides the correct axis value for the `pct_change` method.
