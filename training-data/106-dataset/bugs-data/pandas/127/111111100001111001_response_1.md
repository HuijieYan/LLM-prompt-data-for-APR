The error likely occurs due to the use of `self._get_axis_number` inside the `pct_change` function. Since `self` in this context is a `Series`, it does not have an attribute named `_get_axis_number`. 

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to identify the correct axis (either 0 or 1) based on the `self` input being a `Series`. Subsequently, this axis value can be used instead of attempting to call `_get_axis_number` on `self`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = 0  # Assuming axis 0 for Series
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = pd.isna(data.values)
        rs.values[mask] = np.nan
    
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the `axis` is hard-coded as 0, since we are assuming the input is a `Series`, and `pd.isna(data.values)` is used to check for NaN values. We are also making use of `pd` to access the `isna` function.
