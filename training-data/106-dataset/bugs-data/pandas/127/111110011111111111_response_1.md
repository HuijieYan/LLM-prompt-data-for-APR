1. The test case `test_pct_change_with_duplicate_axis` creates a `Series` using `range(5)` and `common_idx` and then calls the `pct_change` method with the argument `freq="B"`. The task of the `pct_change` method is to calculate the percentage change between the current and a prior element, with support for specifying a frequency.

2. The potential error location within the `pct_change` method is the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with reindexing due to a duplicate axis.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is attempting to reindex the result (`rs`) based on the index of the original data (`data`). This results in a ValueError due to duplicate axis values in the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for duplicate axis values and handling them appropriately.
   - Investigating the frequency (`freq`) parameter and its interaction with the reindexing process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        if freq is not None:
            rs = rs.asfreq(freq)
        return rs
```

In the corrected code, the reindexing process is replaced with the `asfreq` method, which directly changes the frequency of the data. This circumvents the issue of reindexing from a duplicate axis. The use of the `asfreq` method ensures that the data is aligned with the specified frequency, and the percentage change calculation is performed accordingly.
