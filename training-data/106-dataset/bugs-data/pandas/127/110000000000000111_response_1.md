The issue with the current `pct_change` function is that it does not handle the case when frequency (`freq`) is passed as a parameter. The error message `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` suggests that there is an issue with reindexing when the frequency is set.

To fix the bug, the `pct_change` function should reindex the data based on the frequency passed as a parameter. Additionally, when a frequency is provided, the input data should be resampled to align with the specified frequency.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if freq is not None:
        data = data.asfreq(freq)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)

    return rs
```

In the corrected function, we check if a frequency is provided. If so, we use the `asfreq` method to resample the data to align with the specified frequency. Then, the rest of the function remains the same.
