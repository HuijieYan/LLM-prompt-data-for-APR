The error occurred due to the mismatch in the frequency set in the `pct_change` function and the frequency of the index. The `pct_change` method expects the index frequency to be aligned with the provided frequency parameter.

The issue is in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` where `reindex_like` method tries to reindex `rs` to match the index along the provided axis, but it fails if the frequency doesn't match with the original index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code inside the `pct_change` function to handle the frequency parameter properly and align the index based on the provided frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    data_shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(data_shifted) - 1

    if freq is not None:
        rs = rs.asfreq(freq)

    return rs
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` and introduced a new variable `data_shifted` to store the shifted data with the specified frequency. We then calculate `rs` based on the `data_shifted` and handle the frequency alignment using the `asfreq` method.

This approach ensures that the index is aligned properly based on the provided frequency parameter.
