The `pct_change` method is intended to calculate the percentage change between the current and previous elements in a Series. However, there is an error in the method due to the incorrect usage of certain methods and properties.

The bug is caused by incorrect usage of the `self._get_axis_number` method. The method `_get_axis_number` expects the class `cls` as the first argument, but it's being used as a regular method instead. Additionally, `data.div(data.shift())` is not being used correctly to calculate the percentage change.

To fix this bug, we need to properly use the `_get_axis_number` method and the `data.div(data.shift())` method to calculate the percentage change.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
from pandas.core.common import Appender

@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = getattr(self, "._get_axis_number")(self._stat_axis_name)  # Use getattr to access the method
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)  # Use fillna with value parameter
    
    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=fill_method, limit=limit, freq=freq, **kwargs)  # Calculate percentage change directly
    return rs  # Return the percentage change
``` 

In the corrected code, `getattr` is used to access the `_get_axis_number` method. Additionally, `data.pct_change` is used to directly calculate the percentage change, which simplifies the process and avoids the previous errors.
