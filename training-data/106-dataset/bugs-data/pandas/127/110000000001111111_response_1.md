Based on the provided test case and the error message, it seems that the error occurs in the `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` line, and it is related to reindexing from a duplicate axis.

The issue arises because the `rs` DataFrame might have duplicate indices which cause the error when trying to reindex it like `data`. This can happen when using frequencies with `pct_change()` as it creates additional indices based on the time frequency.

To fix the bug, one approach is to reset the index of `rs` DataFrame before reindexing it like `data`. The reset_index() method can be used to reset the index of `rs` and then set the index to match that of `data` using set_index().

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reset_index().set_index(data.index)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected function, after calculating the percentage change in `rs`, the index is reset and then set to match the index of `data` using `reset_index()` and `set_index()`. This should resolve the issue of reindexing from a duplicate axis that was causing the error.
