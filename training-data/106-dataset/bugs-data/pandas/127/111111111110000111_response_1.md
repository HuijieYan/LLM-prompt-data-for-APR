The error message indicates that there is an issue with reindexing from a duplicate axis when using the pct_change method with the frequency set as 'B'.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the pct_change method, specifically in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`.

The bug occurred because the reindex_like method doesn't handle duplicate axes properly, leading to the ValueError when trying to reindex from a duplicate axis.

To fix the bug, the reindexing process should be modified to handle duplicate axes appropriately. One possible approach to fix the bug is to check for duplicate axes before reindexing, and if found, dropping duplicates before reindexing. Another approach is to refactor the reindex_like method to handle duplicate axes inherently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected pct_change function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if len(rs.columns) > 1:
        rs = rs.reindex(data.index, axis=0)
    else:
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the reindexing process has been modified to handle duplicate axes appropriately, ensuring that the ValueError related to reindexing from a duplicate axis does not occur.
