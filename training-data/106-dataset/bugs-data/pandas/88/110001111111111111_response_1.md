The provided code is the implementation of the `pivot_table` function in the `pandas` library. The function encounters an error when the `pivot_table` is called with multi-index columns. It appears that the error occurs when the `pivot_table` function attempts to access the `columns` attribute of the calculated table, leading to an AttributeError.

The reason for this error is that when a pivot table with multi-index columns is created, the resulting table is a Pandas Series object, which does not have a `columns` attribute. Therefore, attempting to access `table.columns` in this context results in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `pivot_table` function to handle the case where the resulting table is a Series object. Instead of directly accessing the columns attribute, we can simply return the Series object when the table is a single level index, or convert it to a DataFrame otherwise.

Below is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Convert to DataFrame if the index has multiple levels
        if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
            table = DataFrame({values: table})
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (remaining code) ...

    return table
```

In this corrected implementation, we check if the `table` is a Series object, and convert it to a DataFrame if necessary. This ensures that we avoid accessing the `columns` attribute when the table is a Series.

By making this adjustment, the `pivot_table` function should now handle the scenario of multi-index columns without encountering the AttributeError.

This code modification should address the bug, and the `pivot_table` function should now work as expected in scenarios involving multi-index columns.
