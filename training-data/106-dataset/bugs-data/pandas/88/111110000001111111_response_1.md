The error is occurring in the `pivot_table` function when attempting to handle multi-index columns.

The bug is likely occurring due to the assumption that the 'table' variable is always a DataFrame, which might not be the case when operating on multi-index columns. This assumption leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of 'table', which is a common error when treating a Series as a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle cases where 'table' might be a Series instead of a DataFrame when dealing with multi-index columns.

Here is the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
        
    table = agged
    if hasattr(table, 'columns') and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return table
```

The corrected code includes a check using `hasattr()` to verify if the 'table' variable has 'columns' attribute before trying to access it. This check ensures that the code can handle cases where 'table' might be a Series instead of a DataFrame when dealing with multi-index columns.
