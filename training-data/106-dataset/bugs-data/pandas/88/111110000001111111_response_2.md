The issue seems to be occurring in the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns. The error message indicates that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns', which suggests that an operation is being performed on a Series object as if it were a DataFrame.

Looking at the code for the `pivot_table` function, the potential error location seems to be in the section where it checks for the `values_passed` and `values_multi` conditions. It then tries to access the columns of the `table` object without first ensuring that `table` is indeed a DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that `table` is always a DataFrame, but in the case of multi-index columns with only one value (which would result in a Series), the assumption breaks down and leads to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to explicitly check the type of the `table` object before trying to access its columns. If `table` is a Series, the behavior should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the updated function with the bug fixed:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (existing code)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.index.nlevels > 1:
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (existing code)

    return table
```
With this modification, the function checks the type of the `table` object before performing operations that are specific to DataFrames. If `table` is a Series, the code will not attempt to access its columns, thus avoiding the AttributeError.
