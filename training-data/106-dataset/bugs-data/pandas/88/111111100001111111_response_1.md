The issue occurs when the `pivot_table` function is used with multi-index columns. This causes an AttributeError because the `table.columns` attribute cannot be accessed when `table` is of type Series.

The potential error location is identified in the portion of code where the `table` variable is being used. The error occurs because the code assumes `table` will always be of type DataFrame, but it is possible for `table` to be of type Series, especially when dealing with multi-index columns.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `table` is a Series when using multi-index columns. The code is written assuming that `table` will always be a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the case where `table` is a Series. One approach is to check the type of `table` and convert it to a DataFrame if it is a Series. This can be done using the `to_frame` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # ... existing code ...

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, pd.Series):  # Check if table is a Series
        table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... existing code ...
    return table
```
