The error occurs in the `pivot_table` function due to an AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This error is caused by a condition checking `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. When the `pivot_table` function is called with multi-index columns, it doesn't handle the case properly and tries to access 'columns' attribute on a Series object, resulting in the error.

The potential error location within the `pivot_table` function is around the handling of multi-index columns, specifically the condition that checks `table.columns.nlevels > 1` without properly verifying if `table` is a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the condition `table.columns.nlevels > 1` should be replaced by `isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1`. This change ensures that the condition is only checked if `table` is indeed a DataFrame and then the nlevels attribute is accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    if isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

By making this change, the `pivot_table` function should now handle multi-index columns correctly and avoid the AttributeError.
