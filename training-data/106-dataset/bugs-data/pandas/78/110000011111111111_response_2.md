The issue seems to be related to the `_reduce` method in the `SubclassedDataFrame` class not returning the correct type for the result of the sum operation. The function is not correctly handling the return type when performing the sum operation.

The `assert` statement in the test case shows that the result of the sum operation is not an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`, which indicates that there is an issue with the return type of the `_reduce` method.

The bug could be located in the section of the code that deals with the return type of the result. It seems that the return type is not being determined correctly based on the input type.

The issue occurs because the return type is not being determined based on the input type and constructor. The `_reduce` method should return a `SubclassedSeries` if the constructor is not None and a `Series` if the constructor is None.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to modify the `_reduce` method to handle the return type based on the presence of a constructor. If the constructor is not None, the method should return a `SubclassedSeries`, and if the constructor is None, it should return a regular `Series`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_reduce` method:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if constructor is None:
        result = pd.Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

With this modification, the `_reduce` method should now correctly handle the return type based on the presence of a constructor, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
