The problem seems to be with the function `_reduce` in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function is returning a result with the wrong type, causing the assertion error in the test.

The bug is occurring because the function `_reduce` is not handling the reduction operation correctly. It is also not transforming the result into a subclassed series, which is expected by the test case.

To fix this bug, the function `_reduce` should be modified to properly handle the reduction operation and transform the result into a subclassed series if needed.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_reduce`:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
    
    data = self._data
    if numeric_only is True:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        
    out_dtype = "bool" if filter_type == "bool" else None
    
    res = data.reduce(op, axis=1, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    result = self._constructor_sliced(res, index=labels, dtype=out_dtype)
    result.index = self.columns
    return result
```

This corrected code will properly perform the reduction operation and return the result as a subclassed series, as expected by the test cases.
