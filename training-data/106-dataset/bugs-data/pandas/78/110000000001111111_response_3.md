The bug is likely located in the `_reduce` method of the `SubclassedDataFrame` class. This method is used to perform reduction operations like sum on the DataFrame and return the result as a Series.

The reason why the bug occurs is that when performing reduction operations, the constructor for the result is not being properly set to the subclassed constructor. As a result, the returned result is of type `pandas.core.series.Series` instead of the expected subclassed type.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_reduce` method to use the subclassed constructor when constructing the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` method:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor if self._constructor else SubclassedDataFrame

    # rest of the method remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the constructor is set to the subclassed constructor `SubclassedDataFrame` when the original constructor is `None`. This will ensure that the result is constructed using the correct subclassed constructor.
