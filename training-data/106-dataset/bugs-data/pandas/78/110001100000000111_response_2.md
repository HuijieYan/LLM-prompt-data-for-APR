Potential error: The issue seems to be in the `_reduce` function in the code provided. The function is not correctly handling subclasses of pandas DataFrame and Series.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `_reduce` function of the DataFrame class is not properly handling the constructor for subclasses of DataFrame and Series. It is not returning the correct type of object when applying operations like `sum` to the subclassed DataFrame.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the constructor and return the appropriate subclassed type accordingly.
2. Use the `constructor` attribute to create the result, ensuring that it returns the correct type of object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    if constructor is None:
        out = Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        out = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return out
```

The suggested change ensures that the `constructor` attribute is used to create the result, returning the correct subclassed type if it is not None. If the `constructor` is None, it falls back to creating a Series.
