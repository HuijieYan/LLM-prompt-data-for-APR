The buggy function `_reduce` seems to be returning the wrong type of result. The test functions are expecting the result to be an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`, but the actual result is a boolean value (`True` or `False`). This mismatch is causing the test to fail.

The incorrect return value is likely due to incorrect logic in the `_reduce` function, which is not producing the intended result.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to review the `_reduce` function's logic, especially the `if` conditions and the operations being performed. It seems that the function is not aggregating the data as expected, resulting in a boolean value instead of a `tm.SubclassedSeries`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    # ... Existing code ...

    if numeric_only is not None and axis in [0, 1]:
        # ... Existing code ...

        # After possibly _get_data and transposing, we are now in the
        # simple case where we can use BlockManager._reduce
        res = df._data.reduce(op, axis=1, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
        assert isinstance(res, dict)
        out = df._constructor_sliced(res, index=range(len(res)))
        out.index = df.columns
        return out

    if numeric_only is None:
        result = op(self.values, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
        return Series(result, index=self.columns)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for aggregation and returning the correct type of result has been revised. The appropriate reduction operation is applied, and the result is wrapped in a `Series` instance with the correct index. This should ensure that the correct type of result is returned, and the test functions should pass without errors.
