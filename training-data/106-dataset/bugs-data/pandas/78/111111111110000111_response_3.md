The error occurs when the `_reduce` function within the `DataFrame` class returns a `pandas.core.series.Series` instead of the expected `SubclassedSeries` type, causing the assertion in the test function to fail.

The issue is likely due to the `_reduce` function not returning the correct type when operating on a subclassed DataFrame, as it directly creates a Series object instead of utilizing the constructor of the class to ensure the correct type is returned.

To fix this bug, the `_reduce` function should be modified to correctly utilize the constructor of the class to ensure that the appropriate type is returned.

Here's the corrected `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor_sliced  # Utilize the constructor for sliced data instead of directly creating a Series

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if constructor is None:
        result = Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

By modifying the `_reduce` function to utilize the constructor of the class, we can ensure that the correct type (`SubclassedSeries`) is returned when operating on a subclassed DataFrame, resolving the issue.

This change ensures that the correct Series type is returned based on the constructor of the class, addressing the bug and allowing the test function to pass successfully.
