The provided test case is calling a method that is expected to return a subclassed series, but it is returning the base class instead. This behavior indicates that the `_reduce` function in the `SubclassedDataFrame` class is not returning the expected type.

Upon analyzing the `_reduce` function, the bug seems to occur because the function is not using the `constructor` to return the proper type, but instead, it always creates a regular Series, leading to the incorrect output type.

The bug occurs because the `_reduce` function always creates a regular Series regardless of the type of the `constructor`. Instead, the function should use the provided `constructor` to return the proper type.

To fix the bug, the `_reduce` function should use the provided `constructor` to create the output Series if it is not None. If `constructor` is None, the function should create a regular Series. This will ensure that the correct type is returned based on the `constructor` and that subclassing is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
# Corrected _reduce function in the SubclassedDataFrame class
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    # ... (omitted code)

    if constructor is not None:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = Series(result, index=labels)
    return result
```

With this corrected code, the `_reduce` function will now properly use the `constructor` to create the output Series and ensure that the correct type is returned based on the `constructor`. This should fix the bug and ensure that subclassing is maintained, allowing the test cases to pass as expected.
