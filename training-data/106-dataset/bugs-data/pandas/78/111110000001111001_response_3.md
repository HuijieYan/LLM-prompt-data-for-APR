The `_reduce` function uses various conditional checks and defines a couple of inner functions, but it appears that it lacks a structured approach to clearly handle all possible combinations of input parameters.

The error is likely to occur in the section of the code that involves `_get_data`. The function `_get_data` is introduced as a local function within `_reduce` and is used without being defined. This can lead to unknown behavior.

In order to fix the function, the inner functions should be well defined and the conditional checks should be reviewed to ensure that all possible combinations of input parameters are handled. The code should also be organized in a more readable and understandable way.

Here's the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    if filter_type is None or filter_type == "numeric":
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    elif filter_type == "bool":
        data = self._get_bool_data()
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Generating numeric_only data with filter_type {} is not supported.".format(filter_type))

    if numeric_only:
        result = op(data.values, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    else:
        result = op(self.values, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    
    if hasattr(result, "dtype") and is_object_dtype(result.dtype):
        try:
            if filter_type == "bool" and notna(result).all():
                result = result.astype(np.bool_)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            result = coerce_to_dtypes(result, self.dtypes)

    out_dtype = "bool" if filter_type == "bool" else None
    out = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=range(len(result)), dtype=out_dtype)
    out.index = self.columns
    return out
```

This corrected code addresses the issues in the original code by ensuring that all data handling and operations are properly defined and structured.
