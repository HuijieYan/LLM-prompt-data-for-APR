The potential error in the function is where it returns a Series without considering that the input is a subclassed DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the _reduce function in the DataFrame class does not take into account the possibility of returning a subclassed Series when performing operations like sum.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the _reduce function to check if a constructor is available for the subclassed DataFrame. If a constructor is available, it should be used to create a new instance of the subclassed Series. If a constructor is not available, the original behavior of creating a regular Series can be used as a fallback.

Here's the corrected code for the _reduce function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    out = self._reduce_frame(op, numeric_only, filter_type, skipna, axis, out_dtype=None, **kwds)

    return out

def _reduce_frame(self, op, numeric_only, filter_type, skipna, axis, out_dtype, **kwds):
        # ... omitted code ...

        if constructor is not None:
            result = constructor(result, index=labels)
        else:
            result = Series(result, index=labels)
      
        return result
```

In the corrected code, the logic for constructing the subclassed Series is separated into a new private method called `_reduce_frame`. This method handles the construction of the Series based on the availability of a constructor for the subclassed DataFrame. If a constructor is available, it is used to create the subclassed Series. If not, the original behavior of creating a regular Series is used as a fallback. This approach ensures that the correct type of Series is returned, taking into account the subclassing of the DataFrame class.
