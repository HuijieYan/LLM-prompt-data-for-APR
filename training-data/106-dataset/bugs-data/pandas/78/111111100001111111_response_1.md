The issue is likely occurring in the `_reduce` method of the `DataFrame` class. In pandas, the `_reduce` method is used for aggregation operations like sum, mean, etc. The issue seems to be related to the return type of the result of aggregation operations when a subclassed DataFrame is involved.

The reason for the bug is that when performing aggregation operations, the `_reduce` method directly returns a pandas Series, even if the input DataFrame is a subclassed DataFrame. This breaks the inheritance from the subclassed DataFrame.

To fix this, we should modify the `_reduce` method in such a way that it checks for the presence of a constructor and returns an instance of the subclassed DataFrame instead of a pandas Series.

Here's the corrected `_reduce` method for the `DataFrame` class:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    if constructor is None:
        result = op(self.values, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    else:
        result = constructor(op(self.values, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds), index=labels)

    return result
```

In the corrected `_reduce` method, we added a check to select whether to construct a new instance based on the availability of the constructor. If no constructor is found, the computation will be performed on the values and returned directly. However, if a constructor is found, we create a new instance of the subclassed DataFrame based on the constructor. This ensures that the correct type is returned regardless of whether it's a subclassed DataFrame or a regular DataFrame.
