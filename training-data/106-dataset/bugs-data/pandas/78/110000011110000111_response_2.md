The error occurs when the `DataFrame` subclass is used and specific boolean reductions are applied. The bug is likely in the `_reduce` function of the `DataFrame` subclass as it returns a regular `Series` instead of the expected `SubclassedSeries`.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the `_constructor_sliced` property is not being correctly utilized in the `_reduce` function. This property is crucial for creating a `SubclassedSeries` instance when reductions are applied.

To fix this bug, the `_constructor_sliced` property should be used in the `_reduce` function to ensure that a `SubclassedSeries` is returned instead of a regular `Series`.

Here's the corrected `_reduce` method:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    # existing code ...

    # check if _constructor_sliced property exists
    if hasattr(self, "_constructor_sliced"):
        constructor = self._constructor_sliced
    else:
        constructor = None  # fallback to regular behavior

    if constructor is None:
        result = Series(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

With this fix, the `_constructor_sliced` property will be used to ensure that the correct `SubclassedSeries` is returned when reductions are applied.

This change should address the issue and ensure that reductions on the `DataFrame` subclass return the expected `SubclassedSeries` type.
