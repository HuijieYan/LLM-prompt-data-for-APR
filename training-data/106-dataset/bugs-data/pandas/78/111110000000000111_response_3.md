The error occurs in the `_reduce` function of the `DataFrame` class. This function is used for reducing data from a DataFrame object. The issue is that when calling the `sum` method, the returned type is not of the subclassed type but rather the base `pandas.Series`. This is a problem when working with subclassed DataFrame and Series, as it is important for methods to return the correct subclassed types.

The expected behavior is for the result of the `sum` operation to be of the subclassed type, `SubclassedSeries`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_reduce` function to return the result as the subclassed type when a constructor is available. If the constructor is not available, the result should be wrapped in a `Series` using the index labels. 

The corrected `_reduce` function is as follows:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        # TODO: Make other agg func handle axis=None properly
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    if constructor is None:
        result = Series(f(self.values), index=labels)
    else:
        result = constructor(f(self.values), index=labels)
    return result
```

This modification ensures that if a constructor is available, the result is returned as the subclassed type, and if not, it is wrapped in a `Series` using the index labels.
