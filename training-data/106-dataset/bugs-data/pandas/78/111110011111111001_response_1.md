The error occurs because the DataFrame class's `_reduce` method does not return an instance of the `SubclassedSeries` as expected by the test case. This indicates that there is an issue with the `_reduce` method.

The potential issue in the `_reduce` method is that it does not create the result in the expected format. It fails to create an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries` even though the test case expects it.

The bug in the `_reduce` method could be due to incorrect manipulation of values and the constructor used to create the result.

To fix the bug, the `_reduce` method should be modified to ensure that the result is constructed properly and returned as an instance of `tm.SubclassedSeries`.

Here's the corrected `_reduce` method:

```python
def _reduce(self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if (filter_type is None or filter_type == "numeric") else self
    res = op(data, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)
    
    result = self._constructor_sliced(res, index=range(len(res)), dtype="bool" if filter_type == "bool" else None)
    result.index = labels
    
    return result
```

The corrected code constructs the result using the `op` function and then creates an instance of `SubclassedSeries` using the `_constructor_sliced` method, ensuring that the result is of the expected type for the test case.
