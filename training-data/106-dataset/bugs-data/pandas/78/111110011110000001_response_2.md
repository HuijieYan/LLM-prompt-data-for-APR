The test function `test_subclassed_boolean_reductions` is used to test the subclassed DataFrame for boolean reductions (`all` and `any`).

Looking at the error message, the assertion `assert isinstance(result, tm.SubclassedSeries)` is failing.

The potential error location within the `_reduce` function is the handling of `filter_type` and `axis`. It seems that the code is not properly handling the case when `filter_type` is None and `axis` is None.

The bug is occurring because the code in the `_reduce` function is not properly handling the case when `filter_type` is None and `axis` is None. It seems to be the cause of the failing assertion. The logic for handling different cases of `filter_type` and `axis` needs to be adjusted to correctly return the expected result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling `filter_type` and `axis` in the `_reduce` function to account for the case when both are None.

Below is the corrected code for the `_reduce` function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    ...
    
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    ...
```

By updating the code to correctly handle the case when `filter_type` is None and `axis` is None, the bug in the `_reduce` function should be fixed.
