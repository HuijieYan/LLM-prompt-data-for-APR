The potential error location within the problematic function is in the last part where it's checking whether the constructor is not None to determine the type of the result. The issue is occurring because the code is not correctly handling inheritance and is not returning the correct type (SubclassedSeries) when performing reduction operations like sum.

The bug occurs because the _reduce function does not handle constructor properly and does not return the correct subclass types for reduction operations.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to check for the presence of a constructor. If a constructor is present, we should use it to create the result, otherwise, we should create a Series with the result and labels. 

Here's the corrected _reduce function:

```python
def _reduce(
    self, op, name, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=None, filter_type=None, **kwds
):
    if axis is None and filter_type == "bool":
        labels = None
        constructor = None
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        labels = self._get_agg_axis(axis)
        constructor = self._constructor

    def f(x):
        return op(x, axis=axis, skipna=skipna, **kwds)

    # ... (other parts of the function)

    if constructor is not None:
        result = constructor(result, index=labels)
    else:
        result = pd.Series(result, index=labels)  # or result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=labels)

    return result
```

In this corrected function, if a constructor is present, we use it to create the result, otherwise, we create a Series with the result and labels. This approach ensures that the correct subclass type (SubclassedSeries) is returned for reduction operations like sum.
