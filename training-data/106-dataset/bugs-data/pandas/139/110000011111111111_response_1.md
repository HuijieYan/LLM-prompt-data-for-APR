The error seems to be related to the `name` attribute not being set correctly in the original `__init__` function. The `name` attribute is initially set to `None`, and it is expected to be the name of the index in the CategoricalIndex. This causes the test function to fail because the index name does not match the expected name.

The bug occurs because the `name` attribute is only conditionally set in the `__init__` function. The code should ensure that the `name` attribute is correctly assigned to the index name.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `name` attribute is set correctly based on the index name. Additionally, the logic for setting the `name` attribute might need to be modified to ensure that it captures the correct name in all cases.

Here is the corrected `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    if name is None:  # Check if name is None
        self.name = index.name  # Set name to index.name if it is None
    else:
        self.name = name  # Otherwise, use the provided name

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected function, the `name` attribute is directly set to `index.name` if it is initially `None`. Otherwise, it uses the provided `name`. This ensures that the `name` attribute captures the correct name based on the index.

With this correction, the function should now correctly capture the index name in all cases, resolving the bug related to the incorrect index name in the test function.
