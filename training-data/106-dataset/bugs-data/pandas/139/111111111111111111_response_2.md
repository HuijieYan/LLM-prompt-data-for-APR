The error is related to the naming of the index column after a groupby operation on a DataFrame with a categorical column.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the `name` attribute is assigned to the Grouping object. This could be causing the issue with the mismatch in column names during the groupby operation.

The bug occurred because the handling of the categorical column and its naming during the groupby operation was not implemented correctly. This resulted in an incorrect name for the index column, leading to the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the code for handling the categorical column and its naming during the groupby operation needs to be adjusted to ensure that the index column is named correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Grouping():
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def __init__(
        self,
        index,
        grouper=None,
        obj=None,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=True,
        observed=False,
        in_axis=False,
    ):

        self.name = name
        # ... (other assignments)
        
        # move the conditional block to handle categorical column
        if isinstance(self.grouper, Categorical):
            # assuming observed=True
            codes = self.grouper.codes
            codes_with_nan = np.nan * np.ones(len(codes), dtype=float)
            codes_with_nan[codes != -1] = codes[codes != -1]
            self._labels = codes_with_nan
            self._group_index = CategoricalIndex(
                Categorical.from_codes(
                    codes=self._labels,
                    categories=self.grouper.categories,
                    ordered=self.grouper.ordered
                )
            )

        # update the index column name only if not explicitly provided
        if self.name is None:
            self.name = self.grouper.name

    # ... (other methods and attributes)
```

With this correction, the code should handle the categorical column correctly and ensure that the index column is named appropriately after the groupby operation. This should resolve the assertion error in the test function.
