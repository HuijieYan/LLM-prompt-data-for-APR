The potential error in the problematic function is that the function is intended to be a constructor, but it is missing the `self` parameter. This means that the function cannot properly access the object's attributes and methods.

The reason for this bug is that the `self` parameter is missing from the function, and it needs to be added for the function to work as a proper constructor.

To fix the bug, the code for the problematic function should be corrected as follows:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis
```

By adding the `self` parameter to the function, we ensure that the attributes and methods of the object can be accessed and manipulated within the constructor.
