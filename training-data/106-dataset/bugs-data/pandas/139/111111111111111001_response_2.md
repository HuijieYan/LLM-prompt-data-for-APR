The bug seems to be coming from the `Grouping` class, specifically in the `__init__` method. The bug is related to the mismatch between the expected index names and the actual index names, which is causing the assertion error while running the `test_preserve_categories` test case.

The error occurs because the `name` attribute of the `Grouping` class is not being properly initialized. This leads to the difference in index names between the expected and actual values, resulting in the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `name` attribute is correctly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `Grouping` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
class Grouping():
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def __init__(
        self,
        index,
        grouper=None,
        obj=None,
        name=None,
        level=None,
        sort=True,
        observed=False,
        in_axis=False,
    ):
        
        self.name = name  # Correctly initialize the name attribute
        self.level = level
        self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
        # ... (other assignments and checks)
  ```

By initializing the `name` attribute properly in the `__init__` method, we can ensure that the expected and actual index names match, resolving the assertion error.
