The issue seems to be related to incorrect column names when using categoricals with groupby and aggregation with skipna. 

The potential error location is in the `__init__` method of the `Grouping` class within the buggy function provided. This method is used to initialize the instance of the `Grouping` class, and it seems to be responsible for handling the grouping information.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to mishandling of categoricals and their impact on the column naming during the grouping and aggregation process.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the column names are handled correctly, especially when categoricals are involved. This involves modifying the logic within the `__init__` method to properly handle the naming of the columns when using categoricals.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
        self.name = grouper.name

    if isinstance(grouper, MultiIndex):
        self.grouper = grouper.values

    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(level, int):
            if level not in index.names:
                raise AssertionError("Level {} not in index".format(level))
            level = index.names.index(level)

        if self.name is None:
            self.name = index.names[level]

        self.grouper, self._labels, self._group_index = index._get_grouper_for_level(
            self.grouper, level
        )

    elif isinstance(self.grouper, Grouping):
        # Handle categoricals
        self.name = getattr(self.grouper, "name", self.name)
        self.grouper = self.grouper.grouper
        if hasattr(self.grouper, "name"):
            self.name = self.grouper.name

    # ... (other conditional blocks)
```

In the corrected code, additional handling is added specifically for the cases involving categoricals, ensuring that the column names are properly assigned based on the context of the grouping and aggregation operations.
