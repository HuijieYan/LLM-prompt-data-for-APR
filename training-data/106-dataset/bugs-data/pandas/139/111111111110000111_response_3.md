The bug seems to be related to the incorrect naming of the index column after using the `groupby` function with a categorical column and aggregating with `pd.DataFrame.sum`. The error message indicates that the expected index column name is "A" but it is actually "index."

The potential error location within the function is where the name of the categorical column is assigned. It seems like the column name is not properly preserved during the `groupby` operation and aggregation.

The bug occurs because when a categorical column is used for grouping and then aggregated using `pd.DataFrame.sum`, the resulting index column is incorrectly named "index" instead of the original categorical column name.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the categorical column name is preserved after the `groupby` and aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function in the `Grouping` class:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    # ... (other assignments)

    # Add the condition to preserve the original column name after `groupby`
    if name is None and obj is not None:
        self.name = obj.columns[grouper] if isinstance(grouper, int) else obj.columns[grouper[0]]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding the condition to check for the availability of the original column names when `name` is not provided, we can ensure that the original categorical column name is correctly assigned to `self.name`. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect naming of the index column after the aggregation.
