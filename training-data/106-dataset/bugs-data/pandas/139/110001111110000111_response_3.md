The error message is indicating that the column names are different. The left side doesn't have any names whereas the right side has 'A' as the name. This indicates that the bug is likely related to how the column names are handled when using categorical data in the groupby operation.

The bug is occurring in the `__init__` method of the class. It is primarily due to the mishandling of column names when dealing with categorical data. 

The issue is caused by incorrect handling of column names when categorical data is used in the groupby operation. The bug leads to incorrect column names in the resulting data, which is evident from the assertion error message.

To fix the bug, the method needs to be corrected to ensure that the column names are handled properly when dealing with categorical data in the groupby operation.

```python
# corrected function
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and self.name is None:
        self.name = grouper.name

    if isinstance(grouper, MultiIndex):
        self.grouper = grouper.values

    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(level, int):
            if level not in self.index.names:
                raise AssertionError("Level {} not in index".format(level))
            level = self.index.names.index(level)

        if self.name is None:
            self.name = self.index.names[level]

        self.grouper, self._labels, self._group_index = self.index._get_grouper_for_level(
            self.grouper, level
        )
