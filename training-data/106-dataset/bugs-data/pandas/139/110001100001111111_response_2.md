The error seems to be related to the way column names are handled when using `groupby` with categorical data and aggregation with `pd.DataFrame.sum` with `skipna=False`. The expected behavior is that the column names should remain the same, but they are being changed to "index" when the data is categorical.

The bug seems to be located in the logic for handling categorical data in the `__init__` method of the Grouper class. When the column is categorical, the logic for handling the column names is not preserving the original names as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling categorical data and column names should be updated to correctly preserve the original column names when using `groupby` with categorical data and aggregation with `pd.DataFrame.sum` with `skipna=False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):

    self.name = name
    self.level = level
    self.grouper = _convert_grouper(index, grouper)
    self.all_grouper = None
    self.index = index
    self.sort = sort
    self.obj = obj
    self.observed = observed
    self.in_axis = in_axis

    # Right place for this?
    if isinstance(grouper, (Series, Index)) and name is None:
        if self.name is None and isinstance(self.grouper, Index):
            self.name = self.grouper.name
        else:
            self.name = grouper.name

    # ... (rest of the method remains the same)
```

This updated code should correctly handle the preservation of original column names when using `groupby` with categorical data and aggregation with `pd.DataFrame.sum` with `skipna=False`.
