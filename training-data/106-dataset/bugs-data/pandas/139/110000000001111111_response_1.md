The issue seems to be related to the `grouper.name` reference within the function. The bug is likely causing the grouping to return incorrect column names, especially when dealing with categoricals.

The error is likely occurring because the function is not handling categorical columns correctly and the `self.name` assignment is not taking into account categorical columns.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle categorical columns appropriately and ensure that the `self.name` assignment takes into account the column names, especially when dealing with categoricals.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    index,
    grouper=None,
    obj=None,
    name=None,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    in_axis=False,
):
    # existing implementation
    # ...

    # fix for handling categorical columns
    if isinstance(self.grouper, Categorical):
        self.name = index.name

    # existing implementation
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, if `self.grouper` is a categorical column, we are setting `self.name` to `index.name` to ensure that the correct column name is used.

This correction should address the bug related to categorical columns and ensure that the correct column names are returned when grouping.
