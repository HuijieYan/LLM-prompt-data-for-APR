Potential error location:
The potential error could be in the calculation of the first and last timestamps using the `_get_timestamp_range_edges` method. Specifically, the method `date_range` seems to be used improperly to calculate the bins and labels.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the wrong handling of ambiguous timestamps, particularly on clock change days in certain time zones (such as Cuba). The improper use of `date_range` might not account for daylight saving time changes, leading to the AmbiguousTimeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use an appropriate method to handle daylight saving time changes.
2. Check for ambiguous timestamps and handle them explicitly.
3. Validate the calculation of bins and labels on clock change days.
4. Consider using specific time zone handling libraries such as pytz to handle ambiguous times.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pytz
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Calculate the bins and labels, accounting for ambiguous times
    # and using pytz for time zone handling
    tz = pytz.timezone(ax.tz)
    start = tz.localize(ax.min())
    end = tz.localize(ax.max()) + to_offset(self.freq)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...
    
    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the `date_range` function is used with proper timezone handling, and the handling of ambiguous times is explicitly included. This should address the AmbiguousTimeError on clock change days in specific time zones like Cuba.
