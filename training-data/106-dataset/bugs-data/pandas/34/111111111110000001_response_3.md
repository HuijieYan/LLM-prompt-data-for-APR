Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class, specifically when the `date_range` function is called.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message suggests that there is an issue with inferring daylight saving time from a specific datetime value. This could be related to how the date range is being generated within the `_get_time_bins` function. The date range may not be handling the transition to or from daylight saving time properly, leading to the ambiguous time error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug would be to modify the way the date range is generated, accounting for potential issues related to daylight saving time transitions. This may involve adjusting the date range creation process to handle ambiguous times more effectively.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import date_range, DatetimeIndex, NaT
import pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas as lib
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

# ... (other required imports)

class TimeGrouper(Grouper):
    """
    Custom groupby class for time-interval grouping.
    ... (other class details)
    """

    # ... (other functions/attributes)

    def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
        if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise TypeError(
                "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
                f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
            )
        
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels
        
        # Use to_offset to ensure that total range of times is properly covered
        offset = to_offset(self.freq)
        first = ax.min()
        last = ax.max() + offset  # Adjust range to include the end datetime
        binner = labels = date_range(
            start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
        )
        
        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)
        
        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)
        
        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
        
        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
        
        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]
        
        return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected function, the `date_range` function is modified to ensure that the time range covers all potential daylight saving time transitions by using the `to_offset` function. This should help mitigate the ambiguous time error that was previously occurring.
