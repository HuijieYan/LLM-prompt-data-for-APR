The error occurs when the `pd.Grouper` is used to group the data by daily frequency, specifically on days when the clock changes due to daylight saving time. This leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` because the function does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

The potential error location is the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class. This method calculates the bin edges and labels for a time series, and it seems that it does not handle ambiguous timestamps appropriately.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` method needs to be updated to handle ambiguous timestamps. This can be achieved by using the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function to specify how to handle ambiguous times. Additionally, the `nonexistent` parameter can be used to handle non-existent times.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",  # Handle ambiguous times automatically
        nonexistent="shift_forward"  # Handle nonexistent times by shifting forward
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # The remaining code remains unchanged
}
``` 

With these modifications, the `_get_time_bins` method should handle ambiguous and non-existent timestamps correctly, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.
