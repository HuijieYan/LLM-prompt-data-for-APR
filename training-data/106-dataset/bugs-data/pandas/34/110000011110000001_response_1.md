The test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` creates a DataFrame with an index containing dates and times that are localized with a timezone. It then tries to group this DataFrame by day using the `groupby` function and calculate the mean. The expected output is also provided.

The error message indicates that the code is failing at the line `result = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()` with an `AmbiguousTimeError`. This error is raised when there are repeated times during a daylight-saving time transition, and the library cannot infer the correct time due to the ambiguity.

Upon analyzing the code provided, the potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` method is identified. In particular, the issue is likely related to the conversion of the index to a DatetimeIndex.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling daylight-saving time transitions when creating the binner and labels using the `date_range` function. As a result, the ambiguous times lead to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the grouping.

To fix this bug, the code should use the `normalize` parameter in the `date_range` function to handle daylight-saving time transitions. This parameter will remove the ambiguity by normalizing the times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import Hour

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        normalize=True  # Use normalize parameter to handle DST transitions
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # The rest of the method remains the same
    # ... (omitted for brevity)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By using the `normalize=True` parameter in the `date_range` function, the corrected code ensures that the times are normalized, thereby handling ambiguous times during daylight-saving time transitions and preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.
