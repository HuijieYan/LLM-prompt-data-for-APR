The error occurs because on a long clock-change day in Cuba, such as 2018-11-04, midnight local time becomes ambiguous due to the time change. This causes an AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of timestamps on the clock-change day, and the creation of bins and labels based on these timestamps.

To fix the bug, the code should use better handling of ambiguous timestamps on the clock-change day. This can involve using a try-except block to catch the AmbiguousTimeError and then handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Logic to handle ambiguous timestamps
    try:
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min(),
            end=ax.max(),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )
    except AmbiguousTimeError:
        # Handle AmbiguousTimeError by shifting the ambiguous timestamps
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=ax.min() + Timedelta("1 hour"),
            end=ax.max() + Timedelta("1 hour"),
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, an exception handling logic is added to catch the AmbiguousTimeError when creating date ranges. If the error is caught, the ambiguous timestamps are shifted by 1 hour to handle the ambiguity. This approach can resolve the issue of AmbiguousTimeError when using pd.Grouper with a daily frequency on the clock-change day in Cuba.
