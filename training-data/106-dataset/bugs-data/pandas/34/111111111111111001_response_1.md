The provided test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` aims to verify the functionality of downsampling over a Day frequency (`1D`) for a given timestamp range, utilizing a Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition period. The datetime index is converted to the 'America/Havana' timezone where a specific DST-related issue occurs because the presented slicing approach relies on local time, which might result in ambiguous and non-unique timestamps during the DST transition. The test leads to an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to the occurrence of non-unique timestamps.

The potential error location lies within the `_get_time_bins` method of the `TimeGrouper` class due to its inability to handle ambiguous timestamps during DST transitions.

The bug occurs because the `_get_time_bins` method does not take into account the possibility of non-unique and ambiguous timestamps, leading to the generation of non-unique bin labels when operating in local time during the DST transition.

To fix the bug, a possible approach involves converting the timestamps to UTC before creating bins and adjusting labels to avoid ambiguity. Utilizing UTC time for bin creation can ensure unique, non-ambiguous timestamps, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The use of UTC time is recommended as it avoids complications related to DST transitions. Additionally, adjusting the labels based on UTC time can provide consistent and unambiguous results.

The corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Convert the timestamps to UTC
    ax_utc = ax.tz_convert('UTC')
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax_utc.min(), ax_utc.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use UTC time instead of local time for bin creation
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz='UTC',
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax_utc.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the timestamps are converted to UTC before creating bins and adjusting labels. This approach helps in handling the ambiguity caused by non-unique timestamps during DST transitions and resolves the `AmbiguousTimeError` observed in the test.
