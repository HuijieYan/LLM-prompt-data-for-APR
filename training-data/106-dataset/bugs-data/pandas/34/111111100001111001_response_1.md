The given function seems to have multiple issues related to the use of functions and the manipulation of time-related data. The function is expected to work with a DatetimeIndex 'ax' and calculate various time intervals based on the frequency ('self.freq'), 'closed', 'label', and other parameters. However, it seems to have issues with handling time-related data and generating the bins and labels.

Issues and possible fixes:
1. The code seems to be relying on methods like 'ax.min()' and 'ax.max()' to retrieve the minimum and maximum values from the DatetimeIndex, but these are incorrectly referred to as methods. Instead, they should be accessed directly as attributes. The correct syntax should be ax.min and ax.max.

2. The code tries to insert NaN values into 'binner' and 'labels', which also appears to be incorrect. The insertion of NaN values should be handled differently.

3. A function call '_get_timestamp_range_edges()' is made to calculate 'first' and 'last' values, but the error mentions 'Values fall after the last bin', indicating that there might be an issue with these calculations.

4. The function expects to return 'binner', 'bins', and 'labels', which are not being manipulated entirely and could result in an incorrect state.

Based on the given information, it seems like issues may arise from incorrect use of methods and functions related to time data and an incorrect setup for the 'binner', 'bins', and 'labels'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min
    last = ax.max
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = binner[:-1].append(binner[-1] + (binner[-1] - binner[-2]))

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

Please note that I've made modifications based on assumptions about the intention of the original code and suggestions to address potential issues. Further testing and validation may be necessary to ensure that the corrected function works as intended.
