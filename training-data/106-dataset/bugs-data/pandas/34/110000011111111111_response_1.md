The error is occurring when the `groupby` function is called with a daily frequency on a date range that includes a clock change day in a specific timezone (in this case, Cuba). The AmbiguousTimeError is raised because midnight local time on the clock change day is an ambiguous timestamp, and the `groupby` function does not handle this situation correctly.

The bug is likely in the `_get_time_bins` method of the TimeGrouper class, where the `date_range` function is used to create the bins and labels for the time grouping. In this case, the `date_range` function does not handle the ambiguous time correctly, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix this bug, the `date_range` function should be replaced with a custom implementation that handles ambiguous times on clock change days in the specified time zone. One approach is to iterate through the time range, taking timezone transitions into account, and create the bins and labels accordingly. The `pytz` library can be used to handle timezone transitions and ambiguous times.

Here is the corrected `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
import pytz
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, DataFrame

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    
    tz = ax.tzinfo
    if tz is None:
        tz = pytz.utc

    bins = []
    labels = []
    start_day = first.date()
    end_day = last.date()

    while start_day <= end_day:
        start_of_day = tz.localize(first.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0))
        end_of_day = tz.localize(first.replace(hour=23, minute=59, second=59, microsecond=999999))
        
        bins.append((start_of_day, end_of_day))
        labels.append(start_of_day)

        first = end_of_day + pd.Timedelta(1, 'ns')
        start_day = first.date()

    return bins, labels
```

This corrected implementation should handle the ambiguous times on clock change days and create the bins and labels for the time grouping without raising the AmbiguousTimeError.
