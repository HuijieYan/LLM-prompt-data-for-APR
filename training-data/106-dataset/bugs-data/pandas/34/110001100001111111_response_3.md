The code fails when it tries to handle the ambiguous timestamp during the clock change day in Cuba. The issue raises an AmbiguousTimeError during the call to the groupby function.

Upon analyzing the input parameters and the runtime values, the bug seems to be located in the _get_time_bins method, and more specifically in the handling of time bins during the clock change day in Cuba. The error occurs because the code does not properly handle ambiguous timestamps during the day of the clock change.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to properly handle ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba. This can be achieved by revising the code in the _get_time_bins method to explicitly handle the ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day and make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the groupby operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_time_bins method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
This corrected code explicitly handles ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba, thus ensuring that the groupby operation does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError.
