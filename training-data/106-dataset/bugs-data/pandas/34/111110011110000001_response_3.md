The error message indicates that an ambiguous time error occurred when trying to infer daylight saving time (DST) from the timestamp '2018-11-04 00:00:00'. This error is likely related to the `_get_time_bins` method in the `TimeGrouper` class, which is responsible for creating time bins. The method uses the `date_range` function to create the bins, which could be causing the issue.

The bug seems to be related to the way the `date_range` function is used to create the time bins. It is not handling the transition to daylight saving time (DST) properly, resulting in an ambiguous time error.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to not directly call the `date_range` method. Instead, use Pandas' built-in functionality to handle the time bin creation, taking into account the ambiguity of DST transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` method:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(None, ax)  # Pass None to binner as it will be populated when creating the bins

    bins = ax.groupby(binner).grouper.group_info[0]

    labels = None  # Initialize labels as None
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This improved approach uses the Pandas groupby functionality to handle time bins and should be more robust in handling DST transitions, preventing the ambiguous time error.
