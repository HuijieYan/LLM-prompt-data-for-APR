The error message from the test function indicates an issue with inferring daylight saving time from a specific time instance. This is a common problem related to time zone conversions and daylight saving time changes, which can lead to ambiguous or nonexistent time instances. 

The potential error within the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is likely related to the calculation of `binner`, `labels`, `first`, `last`, `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, and `bins`. The calculation of these variables and their interrelationship with the time zone information and adjustments are likely causing the bug.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the time instances are correctly adjusted for time zone changes and daylight saving time transitions, especially when determining the bin edges and labels. Additionally, handling ambiguous or nonexistent time instances is crucial to avoid errors related to ambiguous time during time zone conversions.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()
    binner = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, closed=self.closed, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax.asi8, binner.asi8, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if self.label == "right":
        labels = binner[1:]
    else:
        labels = binner

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, adjustments related to time zone, ambiguous time handling, and bin edge calculation are appropriately handled to prevent an error related to ambiguous time during time zone conversions. Additionally, the bin edges, labels, and bins are calculated accurately using `date_range` and `lib.generate_bins_dt64` based on the input parameters.
