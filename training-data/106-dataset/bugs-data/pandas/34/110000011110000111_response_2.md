The error message is an `AmbiguousTimeError` when using `pd.Grouper` to group data by day with a frequency of 1 day, specifically on a clock change day with ambiguous timestamps.

The potential error location within the bugged function is the line `binner = labels = date_range(...)` which is used to generate the time bins.

The bug occurs because when using `pd.Grouper` to group data by day with a frequency of 1 day, it tries to create bins based on a daily frequency. However, in cases like the test example where there is a clock change day with ambiguous timestamps, it raises an `AmbiguousTimeError` because it cannot infer the DST (Daylight Saving Time) time.

To fix this bug, we need to handle ambiguous timestamps when generating the time bins. One possible approach is to use the `pytz` package to localize timestamps and handle ambiguous times when creating the bins.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
import pytz

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use pytz to handle ambiguous timestamps
    tz = pytz.timezone(ax.tz)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This fix uses `pytz.timezone` to handle ambiguous timestamps when creating the time bins, which should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring.
