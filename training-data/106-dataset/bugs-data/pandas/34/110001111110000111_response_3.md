The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised when using the `groupby` function with a daily frequency on a long clock-change day in Cuba. The issue is related to handling ambiguous timestamps on days when the clock changes, such as the daylight saving time transition.

The bug is likely located in the `_get_time_bins` function, which is responsible for processing the time bins. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the transition between standard time and daylight saving time.

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to handle the transition between standard time and daylight saving time on clock-change days more effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    # Ensure proper handling of ambiguous time during clock changes
    first = first.tz_localize(None)
    last = last.tz_localize(None)
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the timezones are removed from the `first` and `last` timestamps before creating the `binner` and `labels` to ensure proper handling of ambiguous times during clock changes. This modification addresses the issue with ambiguous timestamps and should prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from being raised.
