The error message from the test function indicates that there is a mismatch in the class types (Series.index) when using the `str.cat` method with `others` as an Index. This suggests that the `_get_series_list` function is not handling Index objects correctly.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` function does not handle the case when `others` is an Index. As a result, when the `str.cat` method is called with an Index as `others`, it produces incorrect results or NaNs.

To fix this bug, the `_get_series_list` function needs to be updated to handle the case when `others` is an Index. This can be done by adding a conditional block to check for Index objects and process them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)

        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like"
    )
```

In the corrected version, an additional conditional block has been added to handle the case when `others` is an Index. This ensures that the `_get_series_list` function can correctly process Index objects when used with the `str.cat` method.
