The test case `test_cat_different_classes` is trying to concatenate the series `s` with another iterable object of a different type (`tuple`, `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Series`, or `pd.Index`). However, the error message states that the series index classes are not equivalent.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_get_series_list` method. It seems that the method is not handling the different types of input (`tuple`, `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Series`, `pd.Index`) correctly and this is causing the mismatch in index classes.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method is not appropriately handling the different types of input. As a result, when trying to concatenate the series with different iterable objects passed as `klass`, it causes an AssertionError due to the mismatch in index classes.

To fix this bug, the `_get_series_list` method should handle the different types of input (`tuple`, `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Series`, `pd.Index`) appropriately and ensure that the index classes are equivalent when returning the list of series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig.index

    series_list = []

    if isinstance(others, (Series, pd.Index)):
        series_list.append(others)
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple)):
        series_list.extend([Series(obj, index=idx) for obj in others])
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        series_list.append(Series(others, index=idx))
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        for col in others:
            series_list.append(others[col])
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid input type")

    return series_list
```

In the corrected code, the method appropriately handles the different types of input and ensures that the index classes are equivalent when returning the list of series. This should fix the bug and allow the `test_cat_different_classes` test case to pass without errors.
