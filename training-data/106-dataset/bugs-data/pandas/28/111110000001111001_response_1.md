The error in the function is caused by a loop in which the function is recursively called but it does not have a base case. This results in a maximum recursion depth exceeded error. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a base case for the recursion in the `_get_series_list` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            return [Series(x) if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, np.ndarray)) else Series(x, index=idx) for x in others]
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

I added a base case for the recursion by replacing the while loop with list comprehension. The base case now checks if every element in the list is a series or np.ndarray and returns a list of series if true, otherwise returns a list of series with the original series index.
