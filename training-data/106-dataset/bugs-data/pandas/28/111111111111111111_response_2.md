Based on the error message and the provided test case, it seems that the issue is related to the `str.cat` method producing NaNs when `others` is an Index.

The issue is likely occurring in the `_get_series_list` method, which is responsible for transforming the input `others` into a list of Series. The bug seems to be causing incorrect transformation when `others` is an Index, leading to the incorrect output in the test case.

The reason behind the bug could be that the `_get_series_list` method is not handling the case where `others` is an Index correctly, leading to the unexpected NaNs in the output of `str.cat`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a specific condition in the `_get_series_list` method to handle the case when `others` is an Index. This condition should convert the Index into a Series before further processing.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    # ... (previous code)

    # Handle Index specifically
    if isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    
    # ... (remaining code)
```

This correction ensures that when `others` is an Index, it is converted into a Series with the correct index before further processing. This should address the issue of producing NaNs when an Index is passed to the `str.cat` method.
