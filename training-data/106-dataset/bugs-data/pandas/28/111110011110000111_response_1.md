1. The test case is using the method `str.cat()` on a pandas Series, passing an Index object as the `others` parameter. The expected output is a Series concatenating the elements of both the original Series and the others (Index) object.

2. The potential error location in the code is the `_get_series_list` method. This method is responsible for transforming potentially mixed input into a list of Series. It handles various input types including Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like objects.

3. The bug occurs because when `others` is an Index, the method does not handle it correctly. Instead of returning a Series with the elements of the Index, it returns NaN values for each element.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` method needs to handle the case when `others` is an Index object differently. It should return a Series with the values of the Index object and preserve their original index.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        if all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for x in others):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]

    raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like.")
```

This corrected code handles the case when `others` is an Index object by creating a new Series with the values of the Index and preserving the original index of the calling Series/Index.
