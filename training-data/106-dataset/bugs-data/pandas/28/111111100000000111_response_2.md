The test case provided attempts to concatenate two Series, 'sr' and 'others', using the str.cat function. However, 'others' is passed as a pd.Index object, and this results in NaN values instead of the expected concatenation. This issue occurs in pandas version 1.0.3 and persists in the master branch.

The potential error location within the problematic function '_get_series_list' is likely the conditional checks for 'others' type. The function attempts to transform the input 'others' into a list of Series, but it does not handle pd.Index objects correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not have a specific handling case for pd.Index objects. As a result, the conditional statements in the function do not cover all input types.

To fix the bug, the function '_get_series_list' should explicitly handle pd.Index objects. Additionally, it should ensure that all relevant input types are covered in the conditional statements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries) or isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, (pd.Index, Index)):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass, pd.Index))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With these corrections, the '_get_series_list' function now handles pd.Index objects correctly, ensuring that the issue with str.cat producing NaNs when 'others' is an Index is fixed.
