The bug seems to be occurring in the function `_get_series_list` which is used internally by the `str.cat()` method in pandas.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `others` parameter when it is an Index object. It seems like the function is not handling Index objects correctly, which leads to the "NaN" values in the result.

The function should be updated to properly handle Index objects as part of the input `others`.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to appropriately handle Index objects. This could involve checking the type of the `others` parameter and applying the appropriate logic for Index objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, (Series, Index)) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
        # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        # ... or just strings
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

This corrected code should handle Index objects appropriately, fixing the bug where "NaN" values were being produced.
