The bug seems to be caused by the code trying to extract a list of Series/DataFrames from the input parameter `others`. The issue lies in the `_get_series_list` method, where it's trying to handle the different input types such as Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like objects.

The bug is likely to occur because the code doesn't handle all the possible data types for the `others` input. Additionally, the code is overly complex and doesn't follow the best practices for handling different input types.

To fix the issue, we should simplify the logic and properly handle all the possible data types for the `others` input. We can also use the `isinstance` method to perform type checking and refactor the logic to make it more readable and maintainable.

Below is the corrected `get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    
    if isinstance(others, Series) or isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, pd.Index):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        return [DataFrame(others, index=idx)[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, list):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (Series, pd.Index)):
                los.append(x)
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif isinstance(x, str):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            else:
                raise TypeError(f"Invalid type found in list: {type(x)}")
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, DataFrame, Index, np.ndarray or list of valid types"
        )
```

In this corrected method, we first perform type checking using `isinstance` and handle each type of input separately. We iterate over the elements of `others` if it's a list-like object and handle each element based on its type. We also raise a `TypeError` with a clear message if an unknown type is encountered.
