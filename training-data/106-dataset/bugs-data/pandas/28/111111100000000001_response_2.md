The potential error in this problematic function is the inconsistent use of variable names for the function arguments. The function signature specifies 'self' and 'others' as the arguments, but within the function body, 'self._orig' is used without 'self' as an argument. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential bugs in the function.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use 'self' consistently for all class attributes and method calls. Additionally, the function should be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
