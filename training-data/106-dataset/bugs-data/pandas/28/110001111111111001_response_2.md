The error occurs when different classes are passed as the `others` parameter to the `_get_series_list` function. The function is intended to handle a variety of input types including Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like, or list-like of objects that are either Series, Index, or np.ndarray (1-dim). However, it fails to handle the case when a class instance is passed as `others`.

The bug occurs because the function does not have a mechanism to handle instances of classes like tuple, list, np.array, Series, or Index when passed directly as the `others` parameter. It attempts to handle these cases as if they are instances of pandas data structures, leading to errors and incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to appropriately handle the input based on its type. When a class instance is passed, it should be transformed into a Series or a DataFrame based on its content and structure before further processing.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, Series):  # Handle as Series
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):  # Handle as Index
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):  # Handle as DataFrame
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:  # Handle as 2D ndarray
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple, np.ndarray)) and all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1) for x in others):  # Handle as list-like
        los = []
        for item in others:
            los += self._get_series_list(item)
        return los
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple)) and all(not isinstance(x, (list, tuple)) for x in others):  # Handle as list-like containing only strings
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary or list-like (either containing only strings or containing only objects of type Series/Index/np.ndarray[1-dim])")
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles different classes passed as `others` and transforms them into the appropriate type for further processing.
