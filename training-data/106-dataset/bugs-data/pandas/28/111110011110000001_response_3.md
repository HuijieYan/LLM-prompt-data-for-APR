The error occurs in the `test_cat_different_classes` test function, which is using the `str.cat` method on a Series with different data types (tuple, list, np.array, pd.Series, or pd.Index), and then comparing the result with an expected Series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_series_list` function. It seems that the function is not handling the different data types passed to it correctly, leading to the error seen in the test function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_get_series_list` function is not properly handling the different types of input.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add proper handling for different data types in the `_get_series_list` function. This would involve identifying the type of the input and processing it accordingly to return a list of Series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1):
                los.append(x)
            else:
                return [Series(others, index=idx)]

        return los
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like"
    )
```
