The error seems to be related to the `_get_series_list` function which is used to handle different types of input `others` in the `str.cat` method. The function is not properly handling the case when `others` is an Index object, which is causing the unexpected behavior in the output.

The potential error location within the `_get_series_list` function is in the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass)` block. It returns a list containing a Series object with the values of the Index object, but this is not the correct behavior for the `str.cat` method.

The bug occurred because when `others` is an Index object, the `_get_series_list` function should not return a list containing a Series object with the values of the Index. Instead, it should return a list containing the Index itself, as the behavior of `str.cat` when `others` is an Index is to concatenate the values directly without converting them to a Series object.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass)` block to return a list containing the `others` directly, without converting it to a Series object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With the corrected code, the `str.cat` method should now produce the expected output when `others` is an Index object.
