The error occurs at the function `_check_types` in the `pandas/_testing.py` file, where it asserts that the classes of the left and right operands should be equivalent. This points to a discrepancy in the class types of the left and right sides, meaning that the function `_get_series_list` did not return the expected types or values.

The potential error in the function `_get_series_list` is likely due to the handling of the `others` input and the transformation into a list of Series. In particular, the conditional branches and type checks may not be covering all possible input cases, leading to unexpected type or value conversion.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the function `_get_series_list` correctly handles all types of input such as Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like objects. This can be achieved by carefully checking the type of each input and transforming it into a list of Series accordingly.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the returned list of Series matches the expected types and values based on the input parameters, such as `self._orig` and `others`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, pd.Index):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, pd.DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
        # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, pd.Index))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            for item in others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los.append(Series(item, index=self._orig.index))
            return los
        # ... or just strings
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like (either containing only strings or containing only objects of type Series/Index/np.ndarray)"
    )
```

This corrected function ensures that the input `others` is properly handled and transformed into a list of Series based on its type and values, matching the expected behavior in the test case.
