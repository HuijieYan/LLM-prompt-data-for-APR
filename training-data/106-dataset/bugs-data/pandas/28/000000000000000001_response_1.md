The potential error location in the function is in the recursive call to `_get_series_list(others.pop(0))`. This recursive call is incorrect because `others.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `others`, and it may not always be a valid input for the `_get_series_list` function.

The bug occurs because the function tries to recursively call itself with `others.pop(0)`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not a valid argument for the `_get_series_list` function.

To fix this bug, we can modify the recursion to use the entire `others` list instead of popping elements one by one. Additionally, we should handle each element in the `others` list individually, rather than combining all the results into a single list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    import numpy as np

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
    # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
    if all(
        isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
        or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
        for x in others
    ):
        los = []
        for x in others:  # iterate through list and append each element
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
                los.append(x)
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
        return los
    # ... or just strings
    elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```
