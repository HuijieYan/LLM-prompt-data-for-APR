The error occurs because the function `_get_series_list` does not handle the case where `others` is an Index. As a result, the function returns unexpected results, leading to the test failure.

The bug is occurring because when `others` is an Index, the function should handle it appropriately, but it is not. This is evident from the error message that shows `Series.index classes are not equivalent`. This indicates that the function is not properly handling the Index passed in `others`.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to handle the case where `others` is an Index within the `_get_series_list` function.
2. If `others` is an Index, we should convert it to a Series and return it as the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
            "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
            "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
            "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
        )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `others` is an Index and return the expected result.
