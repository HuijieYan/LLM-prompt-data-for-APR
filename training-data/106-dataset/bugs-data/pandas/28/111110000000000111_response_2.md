The bug occurs in the `_get_series_list` method of the `StringMethods` class. This method is used to transform input into a list of Series, which is used in the `str.cat` method. The bug is causing NaNs to be produced when `others` is an Index.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method does not handle Index objects properly. When `others` is an Index, it is not being transformed into a list of Series correctly, leading to the NaNs in the result of `str.cat`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle Index objects properly in the `_get_series_list` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
        from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

        if isinstance(others, Index):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
        
        # rest of the code remains the same...
```

Adding the condition to handle Index objects will ensure that they are transformed into a list of Series correctly, fixing the bug and producing the expected output when `str.cat` is used with an Index.
