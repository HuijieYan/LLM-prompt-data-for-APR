The bug occurs in the `_get_series_list` function, which is used as an auxiliary function for the `str.cat` method. The function is responsible for converting mixed input into a list of Series.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of different input types within the `_get_series_list` function. The function uses various conditional statements to identify the type of input and convert it into a list of Series.

One potential reason for the bug is the inconsistent handling of input types. For example, in the provided code, there is a check for `is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False)`. This might not cover all possible list-like inputs, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_series_list` should be refactored to have a more comprehensive and robust way of handling the input types. This can be achieved by using explicit checks for each type of input and ensuring that they are properly converted to a list of Series.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    idx = self._orig.index if hasattr(self._orig, 'index') else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series) or isinstance(others, np.ndarray):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif hasattr(others, 'values') and len(others) == len(idx):
        return [Series(others.values, index=idx)]
    elif hasattr(others, 'index'):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, list):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, Series) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and len(x) == len(idx)):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            else:
                # handle other types accordingly
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like")
```

This refactored code provides explicit checks for various types of inputs and ensures that they are converted to a list of Series appropriately.
