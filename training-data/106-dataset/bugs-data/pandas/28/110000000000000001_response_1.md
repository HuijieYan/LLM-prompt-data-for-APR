Potential Error Location:
The error could be occurring in the section where the function is trying to iteratively call itself within the while loop `los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the while loop not correctly appending the elements to the list `los` in every iteration, leading to an incorrect output.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the while loop to correctly append the elements to the list `los` in every iteration.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
