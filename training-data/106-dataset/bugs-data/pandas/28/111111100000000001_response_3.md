Potential error location: The potential error location is the `while others` loop, which appears to be attempting to iterate through the list and append each element, but it seems to be missing the logic to handle the different types of input correctly.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling the different types of input (Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like) correctly and there seems to be a missing condition to handle the iteration through the list and append each element.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Add conditions to handle different types of input such as Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like data.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling the iteration through the list and appending each element is correctly implemented for different types of input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    
    # If `others` is a Series or Index, return a list containing `others`
    if isinstance(others, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
        return [others]
    
    # If `others` is a DataFrame, return a list of its columns
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[col] for col in others]
    
    # If `others` is a 2D ndarray, create a DataFrame and return a list of its columns
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        df = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [df[col] for col in df]
    
    # If `others` is list-like and its elements are Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim), or just strings, 
    # then return a list of Series
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    
    # If none of the above conditions are met, raise a TypeError
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like")
```
