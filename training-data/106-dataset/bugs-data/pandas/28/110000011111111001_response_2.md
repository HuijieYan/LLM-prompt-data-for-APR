The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of the index classes between the left and right sides. This is likely happening because the buggy function `_get_series_list` is not properly processing the input data and returning the expected types.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue arises from the conditional checks and type conversions. The function is supposed to transform the input `others` into a list of Series, but the conditional checks and type conversions are not covering all the possible input scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different input types such as tuples, lists, ndarrays, Series, and Index. We also need to ensure that the transformation into a list of Series is done consistently and correctly.

Here's the corrected function for `_get_series_list`:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
    # Transform input into a list of Series
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]  # Ensure that the others are Series or Index
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:  # Check for 1D ndarray
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, (tuple, list)):  # Handle tuple or list input
        return [Series(o, index=idx) for o in others]
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
            "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
            "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
            "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
        )
```

In this corrected function, additional checks and conversions have been added to properly handle various input scenarios and consistently transform them into a list of Series. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and resolve the error message.
