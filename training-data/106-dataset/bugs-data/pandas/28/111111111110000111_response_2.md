The error message indicates a mismatch between the types of Index objects. Specifically, it states that Series.index classes are not equivalent. This suggests that there might be an issue with handling Index objects in the `str.cat` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `_get_series_list` method, as this method is responsible for transforming the input, including Index objects, into a list of Series.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method does not handle Index objects properly when they are passed as input. This leads to a mismatch between the types of Index objects, causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` method should be modified to handle Index objects correctly. Specifically, when Index objects are passed as input, they should be directly transformed into a Series with the same values. This will ensure that the types of Index objects match, resolving the assertion error in the test case.

The corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):  # Handle Index objects
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    # Handle other types of input
    # ... (existing code for handling other types of input)

    # Existing code for handling other cases remains unchanged

    # Added handling for other types of input

    # ... (existing code for handling other types of input)
```
Adding the explicit handling for Index objects when they are passed as input will fix the bug and ensure that the types of Index objects match as expected.
