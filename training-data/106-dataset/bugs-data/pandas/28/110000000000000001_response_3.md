Potential Error location: 

The error could be occurring in the logic used to handle the "others" input parameter. The function is converting the "others" input into a list of Series, but the logic is complex and prone to errors.

Reasons behind the bug:

The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of the different types of "others" input. The function needs to handle various input types such as Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, and list-like inputs, but the current logic is not robust enough to handle all possible cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use explicit conditional checks for each type of "others" input instead of using nested if-elif-else conditions.
2. Use try-except blocks to catch any exceptions while converting the "others" input into a list of Series.
3. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        # Extract each series from the DataFrame and return it in a list
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others)
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, list) and all(isinstance(x, (Series, np.ndarray)) for x in others):
        return [Series(x) if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(x, str) for x in others):
        return [Series(others)]
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or a list-like containing either strings or Series/np.ndarray objects"
        )
