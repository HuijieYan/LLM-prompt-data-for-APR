Potential error location:
The issue seems to stem from the `_get_series_list` function, particularly in the conditional statements that handle different types of input for the `others` parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The conditional statements in the `_get_series_list` function are not correctly handling the input when `others` is an Index. This leads to the incorrect transformation of the input into a list of Series, resulting in unexpected behavior when used in the `str.cat` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional statements in the `_get_series_list` function to correctly handle the case when `others` is an Index.
2. Ensure that the transformation of the input into a list of Series is done accurately based on the type of the input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function for _get_series_list
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    if isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others._data, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, (Series, DataFrame)):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(isinstance(x, (Series, Index, np.ndarray)) and (getattr(x, 'ndim', 1) == 1) for x in others):
            return [Series(x, index=self._orig.index) if not isinstance(x, Series) else x for x in others]
        elif all(isinstance(x, str) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```
In the corrected code:
- The conditional statements have been updated to correctly handle the different types of input for the `others` parameter, including the case when `others` is an Index.
- The transformation of the input into a list of Series is done based on the type and properties of the input, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior of the `str.cat` method.
