The bug is likely in the portion of the code where the variable 'others' is being processed. The function is checking the type of 'others' and based on that, it is returning a list of Series. The bug seems to be related to incorrect conditional checks and the handling of various data types.

The error message states that there is an issue with the type of the variable 'others' and it is not being processed correctly by the function.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for the type of 'others' should be revised to ensure that the correct type is identified and handled appropriately. Additionally, the function should be refactored to simplify the conditional checks and reduce the complexity of the logic.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        others = Series(others, index=idx)
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, list):
        los = []
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
                los.append(x)
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif isinstance(x, str):
                los.append(Series([x]*len(self._orig), index=idx))
            else:
                raise TypeError("Invalid element type in 'others'")
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list of Series/Index/np.ndarray[1-dim]")
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional checks are simplified and properly handle the different types of 'others'.
- It is assumed that 'idx' is defined outside of this function, based on the provided code.
- It is assumed that 'isinstance' checks for 'ABCSeries', 'ABCIndexClass', and 'ABCDataFrame' are valid and appropriately handled by other parts of the codebase. If these checks are not properly defined elsewhere, they should be updated accordingly.
