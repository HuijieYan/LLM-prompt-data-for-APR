The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the types of the index in the Series and the expected RangeIndex. This suggests that the issue lies in the _get_series_list method where the index types are not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the _get_series_list method does not handle the case when others is an Index correctly. It should be transformed into a list of Series, similar to how it is handled for other data types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _get_series_list method to correctly handle the case when others is an Index. We can create a new Series from the values of the Index and use the index parameter to set the index to the original index of the calling Series/Index.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_series_list method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, Index) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError("others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like")
```

This corrected code should handle the case when others is an Index and transform it into a list of Series with the correct indexes. This should resolve the issue with str.cat producing NaNs when others is an Index.
