The potential error in the code is that the function `_get_series_list` is recursively calling itself without making progress towards a base case, leading to infinite recursion.

The reason for the bug is that the code is not properly handling the list of 'others' and the conditions for the different types of 'others' are not mutually exclusive, leading to multiple conditions being true at once.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the list of 'others' and ensure that the conditions for different types of 'others' are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    # base case - if others is a Series, return it in a list
    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    # if others is an Index, convert it to a Series and return it in a list
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    # if others is a DataFrame, return its columns as a list of Series
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    # if others is a 2D numpy array, convert it to a DataFrame and return its columns as a list of Series
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=self._orig.index)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    # if others is a list-like object
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        los = []
        # iterate through list and append each element
        for x in others:
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)) or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1):
                los.append(x)
            elif not is_list_like(x):  # just strings
                los.append(Series(x, index=self._orig.index))
            else:
                raise TypeError("Invalid type in the list 'others'")
        return los
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like "
            "(containing only strings or objects of type Series/Index/np.ndarray[1-dim])"
        )
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the recursive call to `_get_series_list` and introduced a loop to iterate through the list of 'others' and handle each element based on its type. We also added additional checks to cover all possible cases for 'others' and improved the error message for invalid types in the list 'others'.
