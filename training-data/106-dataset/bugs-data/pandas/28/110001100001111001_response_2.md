The buggy function `_get_series_list()` takes various types of input and transforms them into a list of Series. The function has multiple conditions based on the type of the input. The error might be related to the conditions not being correctly evaluated for the given input.

Potential error location: The bug could be in the conditions checking the type of `others` and the subsequent data transformation based on its type.

Reason for the bug:
- The conditions might not be correctly evaluating the type of `others`.
- If the conditions are not correctly evaluated, it could lead to the function not returning the expected output or throwing a `TypeError`.

Approach to fixing the bug:
- We should revisit the conditions and how the type of `others` is evaluated to ensure that each condition is correctly handling the input type.
- After evaluating the input type correctly, transformation of the input data into a list of Series should be performed.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list()` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.

    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):

        return [Series(o, index=idx) for o in others]
