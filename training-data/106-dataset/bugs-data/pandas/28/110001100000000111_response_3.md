The bug seems to be related to the `_get_series_list` function, which is used to transform the `others` parameter into a list of Series for the `str.cat` method. 

The bug occurs because when `others` is an Index, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to NaN values in the result of `str.cat` method.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` function needs to handle the case when `others` is an Index correctly, ensuring that it is transformed into a Series with the appropriate index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=self._orig.index)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, when `others` is an Index, it is explicitly transformed into a Series with the index of the original Series (`self._orig.index`). This should resolve the issue with `str.cat` producing NaNs when `others` is an Index.
