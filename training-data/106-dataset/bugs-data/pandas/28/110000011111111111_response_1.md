The error message indicates that there is a problem with the types of the index in the `test_cat_different_classes` function. This function is testing the `str.cat` method with different input types (lists, arrays, Series, Index), and it seems that the bug is related to the input parameter `others` being an Index.

The bug is likely happening because the `_get_series_list` function is not properly handling the case when `others` is an Index. This is causing the `str.cat` method to produce incorrect results and NaNs when `others` is an Index.

To fix this bug, the `_get_series_list` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `others` is an Index. The logic in the function needs to be updated to properly transform an Index into a list of Series.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others.columns]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 1:
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

This corrected function now properly handles the case when `others` is an Index and transforms it into a list of Series. This should resolve the issue with the `str.cat` method producing NaNs when `others` is an Index.
