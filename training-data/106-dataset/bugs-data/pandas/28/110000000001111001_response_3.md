The code has a few issues:

1. The function is using relative imports which might not work if the function is not part of a package.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison between different types of objects such as `ABCSeries`, `ABCIndexClass`, and `ABCDataFrame`.
3. The function also checks for objects without an index, but the comparison and checks are not being performed correctly with the given inputs. 
4. There are multiple issues related to handling different data types of input parameters and indexing.
5. The function does not handle DataFrame objects correctly.

To fix the function, the following changes should be made:
1. Absolute imports should be used for `Series`, `DataFrame`, and other classes from `pandas`.
2. The function should be rewritten to use correct type checking and comparison, ensuring that the logic covers all the input parameter cases.
3. Correctly handle DataFrame objects, including index comparison.
4. Eliminate any incorrect handling of the instances of numpy arrays or other list-like objects.
5. Consider removing redundant variable assignments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for :meth:`str.cat`. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    import numpy as np

    idx = self._orig.index if hasattr(self._orig, 'index') else range(len(self._orig))

    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others.iloc[:, 0]]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        return [others[:, 0]]
    elif hasattr(others, '__len__') and all(isinstance(x, (Series, np.ndarray)) or not isinstance(x, (str, bytes)) for x in others):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
        
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like"
    )
```
This corrected function accounts for the type of objects being compared and processes the input values correctly, returning the expected outputs based on the input types.
