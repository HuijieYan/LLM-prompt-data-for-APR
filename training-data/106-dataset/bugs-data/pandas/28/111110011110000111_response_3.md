The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `str.cat` method when `others` is an Index. The `str.cat` method is called with different classes (tuple, list, np.array, pd.Series, pd.Index) and the error occurs when `others` is an Index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_series_list` method. This method is responsible for transforming the `others` input into a list of Series in preparation for concatenation.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method does not handle the case when `others` is an Index correctly. It attempts to handle the input differently based on its type, but it does not properly account for the case when `others` is an Index. As a result, this leads to the incorrect behavior of the `str.cat` method when `others` is an Index.

To fix the bug, the `_get_series_list` method needs to be enhanced to handle the case when `others` is an Index correctly. This can be done by adding a conditional block to check if `others` is an Index, and then transform it into a list of Series with appropriate indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        # Transform Index into a list of Series with appropriate indices
        return [Series(others.values, index=others)]
    # ... other cases remain unchanged ...
```

By adding the conditional block to handle the case when `others` is an Index, the bug in the `str.cat` method should be fixed. This will ensure that the `str.cat` method behaves correctly when `others` is an Index.
