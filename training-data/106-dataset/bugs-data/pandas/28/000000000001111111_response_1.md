Potential error location:
The bug may be occurring in the **_get_series_list** method, particularly in the block of code handling the different types of **others** input. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of the **others** input, especially when it is an Index. This leads to a mismatch in the expected output, resulting in the NaN values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of **others** input and handle Index objects correctly.
2. Ensure that the code correctly handles the different types of inputs for **others**.
3. Verify the output for each type of **others** input to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Corrected code:
```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    # self._orig is either Series or Index
    if isinstance(self._orig, Index):
        idx = self._orig
    else:
        idx = self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, (Series, Index)):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)  # ensure iterators do not get read twice etc

        # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
        # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (Series, Index))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            while others:  # iterate through list and append each element
                los = los + self._get_series_list(others.pop(0))
            return los
        # ... or just strings
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
