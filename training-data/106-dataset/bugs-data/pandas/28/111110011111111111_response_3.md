The bug seems to be caused by the `str.cat` method when `others` is an Index. It looks like the `_get_series_list` method is the source of the problem because it does not handle the case when `others` is an Index properly.

The bug occurs because the `_get_series_list` method is not handling the case when `others` is an Index. As a result, the method is returning an incorrect result, leading to the NaN values in the `str.cat` method when `others` is an Index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_series_list` method to properly handle the case when `others` is an Index. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if `others` is an Index, and then handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` method:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index
    
    idx = self._orig.index  # Get the index of the original Series/Index
    
    if isinstance(others, Series):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        # Convert the Index to a Series with the same values and index
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)

    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarrary "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this modification, the `_get_series_list` method should now be able to handle the case when `others` is an Index properly, and the bug in `str.cat` should be fixed.
