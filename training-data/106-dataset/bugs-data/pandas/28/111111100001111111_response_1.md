The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case when `others` is an Index. As a result, it is producing unexpected results, specifically returning NaN values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_series_list` function to correctly handle the case when `others` is an Index. We need to ensure that it returns the desired list of Series even when `others` is an Index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, (Index, Series)):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, DataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]

    if hasattr(others, 'values'):
        others = others.values

    # in case of list-like `others`, all elements must be
    # either Series/Index/np.ndarray (1-dim)...
    if all(
        isinstance(x, (Series, Index))
        or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
        for x in others
    ):
        return [Series(x, index=idx) if isinstance(x, (Index, Series)) else Series(x) for x in others]
    # ... or just strings
    elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]

    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like"
    )
```

In this corrected code, we added handling for cases when `others` is an Index or a DataFrame. We also handle the case when `others` has a `values` attribute, which ensures that the function can handle different types of inputs and return the expected list of Series.
