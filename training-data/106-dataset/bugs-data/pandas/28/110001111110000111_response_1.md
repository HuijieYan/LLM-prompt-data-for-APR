The error occurs when the `klass` parameter is an instance of `pd.Index` in the `test_cat_different_classes` test function. This leads to an assertion error when checking for equal classes of the left and right attributes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass)` in the `_get_series_list` method. When `others` is an instance of `ABCIndexClass`, it creates a list of Series with the index from `others`, which causes the bug.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle `others` as an instance of `pd.Index` properly and doesn't concatenate properly when `others` is not a list, numpy array, or Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for `ABCIndexClass` and add a separate condition to handle `pd.Index`. Additionally, we can simplify the code in the `else` block to handle list-like `others`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_series_list` function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, Index

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, Index):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others[x] for x in others]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        return [Series(others, index=idx)]

    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray "
        "or list-like (either containing only strings or "
        "containing only objects of type Series/Index/"
        "np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles `pd.Index` and simplifies the condition for list-like `others`. This fixes the bug when `klass` is an instance of `pd.Index` in the test function.
