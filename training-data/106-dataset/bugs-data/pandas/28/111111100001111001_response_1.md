The bug occurs when the `_get_series_list` method is being accessed recursively when `others` in the input is an iterable made of Series/Index/DataFrame or np.ndarray. 

The intention of the developer is to flatten the input into a list of Series. If an iterable is given, its elements should be processed and appended to the result list, but the current code utilizes recursion, which is likely leading to an incorrect return value.

To fix this bug, the recursive call should be replaced with iteration.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index
    los = []

    iterator = iter(others)

    while True:
        try:
            x = next(iterator)
            if isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass)):
                los.append(Series(x))
            elif isinstance(x, ABCDataFrame):
                los.extend([x[col] for col in x.columns])
            elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1:
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            elif is_list_like(x) and all(not is_list_like(i) for i in x):
                los.append(Series(x, index=idx))
            else:
                raise TypeError(
                    "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray, or list-like"
                )
        except StopIteration:
            break

    return los
```
