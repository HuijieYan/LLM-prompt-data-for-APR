The bug in the provided function is that it fails to return the correct type and value when the 'others' input parameter is of different types, such as a tuple, a list, a numpy ndarray, a Series, or an Index. On top of that, there are some missing import statements for specific classes and methods, such as is_list_like. 

The reason for the bug is that the function does not consider all the possible types of the 'others' input parameter and does not have the appropriate 'if' conditions to handle them.

To fix the bug, we should add appropriate 'if' conditions to handle different types of 'others' input parameters and return the correct output accordingly. Additionally, we need to import the necessary classes and methods, such as is_list_like.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_series_list(self, others):
    """
    Auxiliary function for str.cat. Turn potentially mixed input
    into a list of Series (elements without an index must match the length
    of the calling Series/Index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    others : Series, DataFrame, np.ndarray, list-like or list-like of
        Objects that are either Series, Index, or np.ndarray (1-dim).

    Returns
    -------
    list of Series
        Others transformed into a list of Series.
    """
    from pandas import Series, DataFrame, is_list_like
    import numpy as np

    idx = self._orig if isinstance(self._orig, ABCIndexClass) else self._orig.index

    if isinstance(others, ABCSeries):
        return [others]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCIndexClass):
        return [Series(others._values, index=others)]
    elif isinstance(others, ABCDataFrame):
        return [DataFrame(others[x]) for x in others]
    elif isinstance(others, np.ndarray) and others.ndim == 2:
        others_df = DataFrame(others, index=idx)
        return [others_df[x] for x in others_df]
    elif is_list_like(others, allow_sets=False):
        others = list(others)
      
        if all(
            isinstance(x, (ABCSeries, ABCIndexClass))
            or (isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.ndim == 1)
            for x in others
        ):
            los = []
            for item in others:
                if isinstance(item, np.ndarray):
                    los.append(Series(item, index=idx))
                else:
                    los.append(item)
            return los
        elif all(not is_list_like(x) for x in others):
            return [Series(others, index=idx)]
    raise TypeError(
        "others must be Series, Index, DataFrame, np.ndarray or list-like "
        "(either containing only strings or containing only objects of "
        "type Series/Index/np.ndarray[1-dim])"
    )
``` 

This corrected function should handle different types of 'others' input parameters and return the expected output.
