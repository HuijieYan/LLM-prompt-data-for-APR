The potential error in this function is that the `if cols is not None` condition is not being handled properly. This condition is meant to check if the `cols` parameter is not None and then perform some actions based on that. However, in the current implementation, it is misleading and not working as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the handling of the `cols` parameter is incorrect, and the checks inside the if condition are not consistent with the intended functionality.

To fix this bug, the `cols` parameter should be properly checked, and the actions to be taken after that should be clearly defined.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable

class ExcelWriter:
    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            col_names = list(self.df.columns)
            missing_cols = [col for col in cols if col not in col_names]
            if missing_cols:
                raise KeyError(f"Columns {missing_cols} are not present in the dataframe")

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = True
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, the `cols` parameter is properly checked to see if the specified columns are present in the dataframe. If any columns are missing, a KeyError is raised with the list of missing columns. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and handles the `cols` parameter properly.
