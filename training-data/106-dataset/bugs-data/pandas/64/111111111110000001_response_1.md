The error seems to be related to the functionality of writing a subset of columns to an Excel file and then reading it back. The expected shape of the DataFrame after reading from the Excel file is not matching the shape of the originally written DataFrame.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, the issue seems to be with the implementation of the `__init__` method of the `ExcelFormatter` class. The method is responsible for setting up various properties based on the input arguments. It should handle writing of subsets of columns to an Excel file correctly, but due to the constraints and possibly incorrect logic, it is failing to do so.

One possible reason for the bug could be related to the handling of subset columns. There might be an issue with setting up the correct subset of columns for writing and reading from the Excel file.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be corrected to handle subset columns properly when writing and reading from an Excel file. This may involve reevaluating the logic for handling subset columns, checking if the correct columns are being considered and written, and ensuring that the correct columns are read back from the Excel file.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        # Subset the DataFrame based on the given columns
        self.df = df[cols]
    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected method should properly handle the subset of columns when writing to and reading from an Excel file. It also addresses the issue of shape mismatch in the DataFrame after reading from the Excel file.
