The potential error in the provided function `__init__` is that the condition `if cols is not None` does not account for both cases - when `cols` is `None` and when `cols` is not `None`. This could lead to incorrect dataframe operations. 

The issue occurs because the code inside the conditional block assumes that `cols` is not `None`, leading to potential errors when `cols` is actually `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to use a different condition that accounts for both cases: when `cols` is `None` and when it is not.

Here's the corrected code for the function `__init__`:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not (set(cols) <= set(df.columns)):
            raise KeyError("Passed columns are not ALL present in the dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
In the corrected code, I have removed redundant conditions and added a new condition to check if the `cols` parameter is not `None` and then further subset the dataframe based on the provided columns. Additionally, I have replaced the bitwise operator `&` with Python's set comparison `<=` to correctly verify that all passed columns are present in the dataframe.
