The bug in the given function `__init__` causes it to fail in the test cases provided. The function is supposed to initialize various attributes and conditions based on the input parameters, but it is not doing so correctly. This leads to the incorrect behavior of the function when being used by other modules, as indicated by the failure of the test cases.

The bug seems to stem from the if-else condition around `self.df = df`. The function checks if `cols` is not None and then goes on to reassign `self.df = df` without any condition based on `cols`. This might lead to unexpected behavior in some cases, where it incorrectly assigns `df` without considering the specified columns.

To fix this bug, the reassignment of `self.df` should be handled based on the condition result of `cols is not None`. When `cols` is not None, the appropriate subset of columns from `df` should be assigned to `self.df` considering the specified columns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None

    if cols is not None:
        if not set(cols).issubset(df.columns):
            raise KeyError("passes columns are not ALL present in dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]
    else:
        self.df = df

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The corrected function addresses the issue by checking if `cols` is not None and then subsets the DataFrame `df` to only include the specified columns. After that, it proceeds with initializing the rest of the attributes and conditions as before. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected for the given test cases.
