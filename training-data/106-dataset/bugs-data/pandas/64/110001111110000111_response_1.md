The test case `test_write_subset_columns` is aimed at testing the `to_excel` and `pd.read_excel` functions to verify if they can write and read subset columns of a DataFrame to and from an Excel file. The error message indicates that there is a DataFrame shape mismatch between the expected and actual dataframes.

Upon analyzing the `__init__` function, it appears that the issue may be related to how the `columns` parameter is being handled. It seems that the code is not correctly checking if the specified columns are present in the dataframe `df`.

The bug occurs because there is a logical error in the if condition `if cols is not None:`. The code inside this condition should check if all the specified columns are present in the dataframe but it is inadequately checking it.

To fix this bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. The condition `if cols is not None:` should be utilized to check if the specified columns are present in the dataframe `df`.
2. If a specified column is not present in the dataframe, an exception should be raised.
3. The section of the code inside this condition should also be adjusted to handle the specified columns properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        missing_columns = set(cols) - set(df.columns)
        if missing_columns:
            raise KeyError(f"The following columns are not present in the dataframe: {missing_columns}")

        # If all specified columns are present, assign the subset to self.df
        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly check if the specified columns are present in the dataframe and handle them accordingly.
