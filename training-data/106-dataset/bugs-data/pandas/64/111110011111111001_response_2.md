The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the `cols` parameter and its checking logic. The function should accept a DataFrame and optionally specified column names to include in the output. However, the presence of the `if cols is not None` check and conditions inside it is causing issues with the function's behavior.

The error messages from the test functions indicate a shape mismatch between the expected and actual DataFrames, which could be due to incorrect column handling.

To fix the bug, the `cols` parameter should be handled differently. Instead of the manual check for the presence of specified columns in the DataFrame, the function should directly use the specified columns (if provided) to subset the DataFrame. Additionally, the condition `if cols is not None` can be removed as it's not needed.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ExcelFormatter():
    # ... other methods ...

    # the corrected function
    def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        
        if cols is not None:
            df = df[cols]  # Subset the DataFrame with specified columns
    
        self.df = df
        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

With this corrected function, the DataFrame will be subset based on the specified columns (if provided), and unnecessary conditional checks have been removed. This should address the shape mismatch issue reported in the test functions.
