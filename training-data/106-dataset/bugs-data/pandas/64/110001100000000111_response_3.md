The issue seems to be related to specifying column names to output to Excel. The test case provided is not working as expected in pandas 1.0.0, as it outputs all columns in the dataframe instead of the specified columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition for checking the specified columns. It seems that the condition is not working as expected, leading to the bug where all columns are being output to the Excel file.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly checking and handling the specified columns. This can lead to incorrect behavior where all columns are being output instead of the specified ones.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to revisit the condition for checking the specified columns and ensure that it correctly handles the specified columns. Also, additional checks may be needed to ensure that the specified columns are processed correctly when writing to the Excel file.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        # Check if specified columns are present in the dataframe
        if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
            raise KeyError("Specified columns are not all present in the dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]  # Subset the dataframe with specified columns

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The corrected code includes a check to ensure that the specified columns are present in the dataframe. If not, it raises a KeyError. Additionally, it subsets the dataframe with the specified columns if they are present, ensuring that only the specified columns are written to the Excel file.
