The potential location for the bug is within the `__init__` function. The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch in the shape of the DataFrames, which could be caused by an issue in the function that writes the Excel file from the DataFrame.

The possible reasons for the bug could be the mishandling of the columns in the `to_excel` method. The columns specified might not be correctly passed to the `to_excel` method, or there could be an issue when reading the Excel file back with `pd.read_excel`.

To address this issue, the `to_excel` method should be checked to ensure that the `columns` parameter is correctly handled. Additionally, the reading process using `pd.read_excel` should be reviewed to ensure that the index and columns are correctly specified.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None

    self.df = df

    if cols is not None:
        if any(col not in df.columns for col in cols):
            raise KeyError("Not all specified columns are found in the dataframe")
        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues identified and ensures that the specified `cols` are correctly handled. Additionally, it performs a check to ensure that all specified columns are found in the dataframe before proceeding.
