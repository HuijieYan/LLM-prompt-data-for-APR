The potential error in the provided function seems to be in the way the class constructor `__init__` is defined:

1. The `__init__` method should take `self` as the first parameter, but the provided code does not have `self` as the first parameter.
2. It looks like there is a check for `if hasattr(df, "render")` but then the code uses `df.data`, so it seems like the intention was to check if `df` has a `render` attribute but it's not being used correctly.

To fix this, we need to:

1. Include `self` as the first parameter in the `__init__` method.
2. After checking for `hasattr(df, "render")`, if `df` does have a `render` attribute, then `df.data` should be used.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
# Corrected __init__ method
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data  # use df.data if df has a render attribute
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not set(cols).issubset(df.columns):
            raise KeyError("Passed columns are not ALL present in the dataframe")  # fixed error message

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
