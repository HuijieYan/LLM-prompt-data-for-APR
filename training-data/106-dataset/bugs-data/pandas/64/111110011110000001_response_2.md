The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the shape of the DataFrames. The `test_write_subset_columns` function writes a subset of columns to an Excel file and then reads the same file back to compare the expected and actual results. The error suggests that the read DataFrame has an extra column compared to the expected DataFrame.

The bug in the code is likely related to the handling of columns when writing to and reading from an Excel file. The `to_excel` method writes only columns "A" and "B" to the file, but when it's read back using `pd.read_excel`, an additional column "C" is present, leading to a shape mismatch.

The bug might be occurring in the `ExcelFormatter` class, where the `cols` parameter is not being effectively used to filter the columns being read from the Excel file.

To fix the bug, the `cols` parameter should be properly utilized in the `ExcelFormatter.__init__` method to ensure that only the specified columns are read from the Excel file.

The corrected function `__init__` method is as follows:
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    
    if cols is not None:
        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

In the corrected code, the `cols` parameter is used to filter the `df` DataFrame before further processing to ensure that only the specified columns are used. This should fix the issue of the extra column being present in the read DataFrame.
