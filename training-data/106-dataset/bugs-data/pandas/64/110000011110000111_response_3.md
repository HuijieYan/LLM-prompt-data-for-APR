The test case `test_write_subset_columns` is intended to write a subset of the DataFrame to an Excel file and then read the same subset of columns back into a new DataFrame. The test is failing with an error indicating that the shape of the dataframes is mismatched.

The potential error location within the given function is the handling of the `columns` parameter when writing to an Excel file. It seems that the `columns` parameter is not being properly applied when writing the DataFrame to the Excel file, causing all columns to be written irrespective of the specified subset.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling or application of the `columns` parameter during the write operation to the Excel file. It appears that the buggy function is not taking into account the subset of columns specified and is writing all the columns instead.

To fix this bug, the handling of the `columns` parameter in the `to_excel` method needs to be reviewed. The correct subset of columns should be extracted from the DataFrame before writing to the Excel file. The provided function should take into account the subset of columns specified and only write those columns to the Excel file.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        self.df = df[cols]  # Write only the specified subset of columns to the Excel file

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The corrected code includes a modified conditional block to extract and store only the subset of specified columns if the `cols` parameter is provided. This ensures that only the specified subset of columns is written to the Excel file.
