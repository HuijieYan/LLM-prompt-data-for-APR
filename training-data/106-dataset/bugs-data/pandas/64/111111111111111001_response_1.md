The issue in the provided function is related to the handling of the `cols` parameter. It appears that the logic for handling the columns to be written to Excel is causing the function to select only the specified columns, leading to a mismatch in the shape of the dataframes when the test is run. This is evident from the error message indicating a shape mismatch between the expected and read dataframes.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The `cols` parameter is not being handled correctly, resulting in a mismatch in the shape of the dataframes.
2. The logic to handle the selection of columns using the `cols` parameter is not appropriately implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling the `cols` parameter to ensure that only the specified columns are used from the dataframe when writing to Excel.
2. Validate the behavior of the function for different values of the `cols` parameter and ensure that the correct subset of columns is extracted and written to Excel.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __init__(
        self,
        df,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None

        if cols is not None:
            if all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
                self.df = df[cols]
            else:
                raise KeyError("All specified columns are not present in the dataframe")
        else:
            self.df = df

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
In the corrected code, the `cols` parameter is appropriately handled to select the specified subset of columns from the dataframe `df`. This should resolve the shape mismatch issue and ensure that the correct data is written to Excel.

Please replace the original function with this corrected version and test it again to verify if the issue is resolved.
