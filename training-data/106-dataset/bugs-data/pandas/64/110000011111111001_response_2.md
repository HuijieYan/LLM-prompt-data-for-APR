The provided code for the `__init__` function has several issues. The function takes multiple parameters, but it doesn't handle all of them correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and errors in the test cases.

Issues with the `__init__` function:
1. Inconsistency in handling the `cols` parameter: The function checks for the presence of columns in the dataframe based on the `cols` parameter, but the logic for this check is incorrect. It doesn't handle the case where `cols` is not provided correctly.
2. Incorrect handling of the `df` parameter: The function doesn't handle the `df` parameter appropriately in all cases, as it modifies the `df` variable based on certain conditions without clear documentation or consistent logic.
3. The function makes use of some variables that are not defined in the provided code, such as `Index()`, which makes the code incomplete.

Approach for fixing the issues:
1. Improve the logic for checking the presence of columns in the dataframe based on the `cols` parameter. This can be achieved by using proper conditional checks.
2. Ensure that the `df` parameter is not modified unexpectedly and document the behavior clearly.
3. Provide a definition or import for the `Index()` function and other necessary modules to make the code complete and functional.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable, Label
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, CSSToExcelConverter

class ClassName:
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        df: DataFrame,
        na_rep: str = "",
        float_format: Optional[str] = None,
        cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
        header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
        index: bool = True,
        index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
        merge_cells: bool = False,
        inf_rep: str = "inf",
        style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ):
        self.rowcounter = 0
        self.na_rep = na_rep
        if hasattr(df, "render"):
            self.styler = df
            df = df.data
            if style_converter is None:
                style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
            self.style_converter = style_converter
        else:
            self.styler = None
        self.df = df
        if cols is not None:
            if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
                raise KeyError("Columns are not present in the dataframe.")
            self.df = df[cols]

        self.columns = self.df.columns
        self.float_format = float_format
        self.index = index
        self.index_label = index_label
        self.header = header
        self.merge_cells = merge_cells
        self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

Please note that you would need to import the necessary modules and classes as per your specific requirements to make the corrected function operational. Also, this function is assumed to be part of a class named `ClassName` as the surrounding context wasn't provided.
