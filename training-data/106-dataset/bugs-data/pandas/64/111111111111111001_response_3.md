The error message indicates that there is a shape mismatch between the expected DataFrame and the DataFrame read from the excel file in the test function `test_write_subset_columns`. The problem likely lies in the `to_excel` method of the `write_frame` in the buggy function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `write_frame.to_excel` method, where the `write_frame` is being written to an excel file.

The bug is likely occurring because the `to_excel` method is not correctly handling the subset columns and the index parameter. It seems that the columns=['A', 'B'] parameter is not functioning as expected, and the index=to_excel_index parameter is not being handled correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review how the `to_excel` method is handling the subset of columns and the index parameter. It might be necessary to revise the implementation of the `to_excel` method to ensure that it correctly writes the subset of columns with or without the index based on the to_excel_index parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not all(col in df.columns for col in cols):
            raise KeyError("Passed columns are not ALL present in dataframe")

        self.df = df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

Please note that the suggested correction assumes that the issue is related to the way the subset of columns and the index parameter are being handled within the `to_excel` method. If the issue persists, further investigation may be required.
