The error message is indicating a DataFrame shape mismatch during comparison in the test function. The test function is trying to write a subset of columns to an Excel file and then reading it back to compare with the expected DataFrame. However, the shape of the read DataFrame is different from the expected one, leading to the assertion error.

Upon analyzing the function `__init__` provided, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of columns. The `cols` parameter is being checked against the DataFrame columns, and there are conditions related to the length of the intersection, but the code for handling the subset of columns seems unclear and may be causing the mismatch.

The potential reason behind the bug could be that the code for handling the subset of columns is not correctly taking into account the requested subset, leading to the DataFrame having the wrong shape.

To fix the bug, the handling of subset columns should be revisited to ensure that the correct subset is extracted from the DataFrame before writing to the Excel file. Additionally, the read operation should also be checked to correctly read the subset of columns back from the file.

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    
    if cols is not None:
        subset_df = df[cols]  # Extract subset of columns
        self.df = subset_df
    else:
        self.df = df

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

The corrected function explicitly extracts the subset of columns from the DataFrame if the `cols` parameter is provided. This ensures that the correct subset is used when writing to the Excel file. Additionally, the read operation should also be adjusted to read the subset of columns back from the file when comparing the expected and read DataFrames.
