The error in the code is likely related to the `to_excel` method and the way it handles the inclusion of the index in the file. The "col_subset_bug" scenario where columns A and B are written to a file with and without including the index seems to be failing when reading back due to DataFrame shape mismatch.

The given buggy function seems to have issues related to handling the columns and index parameters when writing the DataFrame to an Excel file.

Additionally, the `__init__` method in the provided code does not seem to be correctly processing the input parameters and initializing the instance variables.

To fix this bug, you can make the following changes:

1. Adjust the `to_excel` method call to properly handle the inclusion of the index.

Here is the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        cols = list(set(cols) & set(self.df.columns))
        if not cols:
            raise KeyError("passed columns are not present in the dataframe")
        self.df = self.df[cols]

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```

This corrected code ensures that the `cols` parameter only contains valid columns that are present in the DataFrame. Moreover, it properly handles the `index` parameter.

After making these changes, the `to_excel` method should work as expected and the DataFrame shape mismatch issue should be resolved.

Please note that the above solution assumes specific requirements based on the given error messages and test function. Additional details about the test setup and environment could lead to more accurate fixes.
