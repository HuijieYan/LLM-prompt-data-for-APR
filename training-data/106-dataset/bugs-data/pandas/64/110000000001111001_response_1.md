The code provided is for the `__init__` method of a class. It seems to handle the initialization of certain attributes of the class instance. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `cols` parameter in the function.

After analyzing both the buggy and expected cases, it's evident that the code is attempting to compare the elements of the `cols` list with the columns in the DataFrame (`df.columns`). The intention is to ensure that all the columns specified in `cols` are present in the DataFrame's columns.

The bug likely originates from the following lines of code:

```python
if not len(Index(cols) & df.columns):
    raise KeyError("passes columns are not ALL present dataframe")
```

The issue here is the improper use of the `Index` class. It should be used to create an Index object for comparison.

To fix the bug, the problematic lines can be revised as follows:

```python
if not len(pd.Index(cols).intersection(df.columns)):
    raise KeyError("passes columns are not ALL present in the dataframe")
```

Here, we are creating an Index object from the `cols` list using `pd.Index()` and then using the `intersection` method to find the common elements with the DataFrame's columns. If the length of the resulting intersection is 0, it means that not all columns specified in `cols` are present in the DataFrame.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union, Callable


def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[str], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:
        if not len(pd.Index(cols).intersection(df.columns)):
            raise KeyError("passes columns are not ALL present in the dataframe")

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
