The error in the code is likely the condition `len(Index(cols) & df.columns)` which is trying to check if all the columns in the 'cols' list are present in the DataFrame. However, the `Index` object has not been imported.

The bug occurs because the code tries to check the intersection between a list and a `pandas.Index` object, but the `Index` class is not correctly used in the condition.

To fix the bug, the `Index` class needs to be imported from the pandas library. Then, the condition can be correctly evaluated by converting the 'cols' list into a pandas `Index` object using `pd.Index(cols)`. Then we can perform the intersection using the `&` operator.

Here's the corrected code with the necessary import and the fixed condition.

```python
import pandas as pd

def __init__(
    self,
    df,
    na_rep: str = "",
    float_format: Optional[str] = None,
    cols: Optional[Sequence[Label]] = None,
    header: Union[Sequence[Label], bool] = True,
    index: bool = True,
    index_label: Optional[Union[Label, Sequence[Label]]] = None,
    merge_cells: bool = False,
    inf_rep: str = "inf",
    style_converter: Optional[Callable] = None,
):
    self.rowcounter = 0
    self.na_rep = na_rep
    if hasattr(df, "render"):
        self.styler = df
        df = df.data
        if style_converter is None:
            style_converter = CSSToExcelConverter()
        self.style_converter = style_converter
    else:
        self.styler = None
    self.df = df
    if cols is not None:

        # Check for intersection between list and Index
        if not pd.Index(cols).isin(df.columns).all():
            # raise an error if the columns are not present
            raise KeyError("passes columns are not ALL present in dataframe")

    self.columns = self.df.columns
    self.float_format = float_format
    self.index = index
    self.index_label = index_label
    self.header = header
    self.merge_cells = merge_cells
    self.inf_rep = inf_rep
```
