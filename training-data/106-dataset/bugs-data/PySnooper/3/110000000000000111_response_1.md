# Potential Error Location
The potential error is on line 11 where `output_path` is used instead of `output` in the second if statement.

# Reasons behind the Bug
The error is occurring because the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function, and it should be using the `output` variable instead to open the file.

# Suggested Approach
To fix this bug, the function needs to use the `output` variable instead of `output_path` when opening the file in the second if statement.

# Corrected Code
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import pysnooper.utils as utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
The corrected code uses the `output` variable instead of `output_path` in the second if statement, ensuring that the correct variable is used when opening the file.
