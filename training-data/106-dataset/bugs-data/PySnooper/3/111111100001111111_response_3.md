The error "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" indicates that the variable 'output_path' is not defined in the code, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional block where output is a string or PathLike. The code is trying to open a file using 'output_path' instead of 'output'.

The bug occurred because the variable 'output_path' is not defined anywhere in the function, and it should be using the 'output' variable instead.

To fix the bug, we need to replace 'output_path' with 'output' inside the conditional block where we are opening the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from collections.abc import Collection
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, Collection)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced 'output_path' with 'output' inside the conditional block where we are opening the file. This should resolve the NameError and fix the bug.
