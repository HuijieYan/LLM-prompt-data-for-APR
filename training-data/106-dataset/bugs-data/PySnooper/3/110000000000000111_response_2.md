Potential error location: Line 6 and Line 10 of the buggy function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- In the first conditional block, the variable `output_path` is used without being defined. It should use `output` instead.
- In the second conditional block, the variable `output` is used instead of `output_path`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Replace `output_path` with `output` in the first conditional block.
- Replace `output` with `output_path` in the second conditional block.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
