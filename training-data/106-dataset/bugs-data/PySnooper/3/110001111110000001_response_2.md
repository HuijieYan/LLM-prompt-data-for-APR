Potential error location: 
The error is occurring because the variable 'output_path' is not defined in the 'write' function, but 'output' is being used as the variable name instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'write' function is not defined correctly based on the value of the 'output' variable. The variable 'output_path' is undefined, and the correct variable to use is 'output'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct variable 'output_path' in the 'write' function when 'output' is a file path.
2. Pass the 'output' instead of 'output_path' to the 'write' function when 'output' is a file path.
3. Remove the 'output_path' variable and use 'output' directly within the 'write' function when 'output' is a file path.
   
Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
