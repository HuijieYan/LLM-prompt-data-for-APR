The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined, which is causing a `NameError` when the function tries to open a file with that variable's value.

The potential error lies within the section of the code where the function `write` is defined based on the type of `output`. In the `elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` branch, the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output`.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is incorrectly referencing `output_path` instead of `output` when opening a file for writing.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use the variable `output` when opening a file, rather than `output_path`. Additionally, the import statements for `sys` and `pycompat` should be included.

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike  # assuming this import is from a specific module

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):  # assuming PathLike is imported from the correct module
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

This corrected code ensures that the `output` variable is used when opening a file and addresses the issue causing the `NameError`.
