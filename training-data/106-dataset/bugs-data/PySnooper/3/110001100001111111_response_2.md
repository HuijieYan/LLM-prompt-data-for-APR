The error seems to be occurring due to the use of the variable `output_path` instead of `output` in the function when handling file output.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement where `isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))`. Here, `output_path` should be replaced with `output` to correctly open the file.

The bug occurs because the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems like a typo where `output_path` should have been `output`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` inside the conditional statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code, we have replaced `output_path` with `output` in the conditional statement where file output is being handled. This should resolve the `NameError` issue.
