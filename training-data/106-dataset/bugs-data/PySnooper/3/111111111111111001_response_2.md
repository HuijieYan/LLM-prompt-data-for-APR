The error message indicates that `output_path` is not defined, which is causing a `NameError`. This implies that the variable `output` is not being used correctly in the `get_write_function` method.

The potential error location is within the if-elif-else conditional blocks where different `write` functions are defined based on the type of `output`.

The bug occurred because the variable `output` was not being used correctly to define the file path. Instead, a different variable `output_path` was used, which is not defined. This leads to the `NameError` when the function tries to access `output_path`.

To fix this bug, we need to use the correct variable `output` to define the file path.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` method:

```python
import sys
from pycompat import PathLike
from utils import WritableStream

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code, the variable `output` is used to define the file path, ensuring that it is correctly referenced in each conditional block.
