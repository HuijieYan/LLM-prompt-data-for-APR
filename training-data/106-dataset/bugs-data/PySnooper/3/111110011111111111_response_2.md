The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined. This suggests that there is an issue with the function `get_write_function` where the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output`.

Upon analyzing the code, it is evident that the problematic section is the conditional block for the `str` case:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this block, the variable `output_path` should be replaced with `output` to correctly open the file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is a simple typo where the variable name is used incorrectly, resulting in a `NameError`.

To fix the bug, the correct variable name should be used, which is `output` instead of `output_path`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # <-- Correct variable name used here
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
