Potential error location: The if-elif-else statement in the get_write_function is not properly defining the write function for the different cases.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the write function is not being properly defined within the if-elif-else statement. Each branch of the if-elif-else statement is defining a new write function without any scope outside of that specific branch.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: Define the write function outside of the if-elif-else statement and assign the appropriate function definition based on the conditions.

Corrected code:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
