The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined. This error occurs because the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the buggy function. It seems like there is a typo or mistake in the code where `output_path` should have been `output`. 

To fix the bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` in the section of code where the variable is being used for file operations.

```python
from typing import Union, TextIO, AnyStr

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIO, AnyStr]) -> AnyStr:
    if output is None:
        def write(s: AnyStr):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s: AnyStr):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s: AnyStr):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected function, we have replaced `output_path` with `output` in the appropriate location. This should resolve the "NameError: name 'output_path' is not defined" issue reported in the error message.
