The error message "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" indicates that there is a variable `output_path` being used without being defined in the function. This suggests that the variable `output_path` is a typo and should be replaced with the `output` parameter.

The potential error location is in the `elif` block where the `open` function is called. The variable `output_path` is not defined and should be replaced with the `output` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` does not exist in the function, and it is most likely a typo that should be replaced with the `output` parameter.

To fix the bug, we should replace all instances of `output_path` with `output` in the `elif` block.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

# this is the corrected function
def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, TextIOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
