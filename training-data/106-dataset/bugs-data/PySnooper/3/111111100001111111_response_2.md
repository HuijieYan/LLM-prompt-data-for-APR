Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the elif block where the variable `output_path` is being used instead of `output`. This is causing a NameError as `output_path` is not defined.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The variable `output_path` is being used instead of `output` in the elif block, which is causing the NameError. This is likely a typo or oversight in the code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `output_path` with `output` in the elif block to use the correct variable.
2. Ensure that all variable names are used consistently and accurately throughout the function.

Corrected Code:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
