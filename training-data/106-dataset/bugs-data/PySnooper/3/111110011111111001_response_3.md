The error message indicates a NameError in the variable `output_path`, which is not defined. This error occurs in the else block of the `get_write_function` where the variable `output_path` is used, but it was not defined in the function.

The potential fix for this bug is to use the input parameter `output` and not `output_path` within the else block of the `get_write_function` function. This will ensure that the correct variable is used based on the input type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code:
- I have imported the required modules and type hinting to make the function definition clearer.
- The `output_path` variable is replaced with `output` within the else block.
- Updated the type of `output` from `pycompat.PathLike` to `PathLike`.
- The function is now more readable and handles different types of outputs appropriately.
