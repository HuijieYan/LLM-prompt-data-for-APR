Potential error location:
The error occurs in the section of code where the output_path variable is being used without being defined.

Reason for the bug:
The variable named output_path is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems that the intention was to use the output variable instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to replace the undefined variable, output_path, with the correct variable, output, in the code.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from . import pycompat, utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
