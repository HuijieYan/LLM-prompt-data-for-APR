1. The test function is attempting to use the `pysnooper.snoop` decorator to trace the `my_function` and write the output to a file. However, the test function throws a `NameError` when it tries to open the `output_path` file for writing.

2. The potential error location within the `get_write_function` method is the block handling the case where `output` is a string. The variable `output_path` is used instead of `output`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` is not defined, which leads to the `NameError`.

4. To fix this bug, the `output_path` variable should be corrected to use the `output` variable instead. Additionally, the bug can be fixed by making sure the correct variable (`output`) is used in the respective branches of the if-else statements.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` method:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):  # Changed pycompat.PathLike to PathLike
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Changed output_path to output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With these changes, the `output_path` variable has been corrected to use the `output` variable instead. This should resolve the `NameError` issue identified in the original function.
