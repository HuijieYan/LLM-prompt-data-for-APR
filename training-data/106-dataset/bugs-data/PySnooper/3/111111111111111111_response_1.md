The error occurs when the code tries to open a file using the variable `output_path`, which is not defined. This is causing a NameError. The reason behind this bug is that the correct variable name should be `output`, not `output_path`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the variable `output` instead of `output_path` when opening the file.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code, we have changed `output_path` to simply `output` when opening the file. This will resolve the NameError issue.
