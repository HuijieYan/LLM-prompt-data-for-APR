The error message "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" indicates that there is a variable named 'output_path' that is being used without being defined in the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif block where it tries to open a file using the 'output_path' variable, which is not defined.

The bug occurred because the variable 'output_path' is used in the elif block without being defined. The intention was to use the 'output' variable as the file path, but 'output_path' is used instead.

To fix the bug, we need to replace 'output_path' with 'output' inside the elif block.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, TextIOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
