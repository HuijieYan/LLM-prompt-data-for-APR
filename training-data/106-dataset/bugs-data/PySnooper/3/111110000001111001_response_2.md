The bug in the provided function is that the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the code, and it is used inside the function for writing to the file.

The code is trying to handle different types of outputs: None, string paths, and a custom writable stream. However, there are a few issues with the code.

- `sys` and `pycompat` modules are not imported in the function, so they need to be imported at the beginning of the file.
- In the `if` block for handling a string output path, the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output`. This is likely a typo, and it should be changed to `output` to match the input parameter.
- The function should also handle the case where `output` is `None`. It can be done by adding an explicit `else` block for that case.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[str, None, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With these changes, the function will handle different types of output correctly and return the appropriate write function based on the type of output provided.
