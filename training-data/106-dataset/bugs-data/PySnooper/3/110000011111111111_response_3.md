The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined, leading to a NameError. This error occurs when attempting to open the file using `output_path`, which is not defined in the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `if-elif-else` block where the `write` function is defined based on the type of `output`. The `output` variable is used as `output_path` inside the `elif` block, but it should simply be used as `output`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` is not defined, which leads to a NameError when trying to open the file with that variable.

To fix the bug, the correct variable name `output` should be used instead of `output_path` inside the `elif` block.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, 'utils.WritableStream']):

    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
