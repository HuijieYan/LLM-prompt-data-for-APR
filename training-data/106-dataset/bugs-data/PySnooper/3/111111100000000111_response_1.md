The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif block where the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output` inside the `with open()` statement.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function, and it should be using the `output` variable instead.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the correct variable `output` instead of `output_path` inside the `with open()` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union, TextIO
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIO]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIO)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
