Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:` within the `get_write_function` method.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the given function. This is most likely a typo, and the correct variable name should be `output` instead of `output_path`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change `output_path` to `output` within the function.
2. Check and ensure that the variable `output` is indeed defined and has the correct value before attempting to use it.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
