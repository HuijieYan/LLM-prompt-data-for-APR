The issue with the buggy function is that the `output_path` variable is being used instead of the `output` variable inside the `get_write_function` function. Additionally, the required imports are missing.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to use a variable `output_path` which is not defined anywhere in the function.

To fix the bug, the `output_path` variable needs to be replaced with the `output` variable within the condition where `output` is of type `pycompat.PathLike` or `str`. Additionally, the missing `sys` and `pycompat` imports need to be added to the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pysnooper import pycompat, utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, pycompat.PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
