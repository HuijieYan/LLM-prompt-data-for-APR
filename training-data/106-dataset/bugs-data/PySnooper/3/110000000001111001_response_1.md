The bug in the provided function `get_write_function` is that in the section where `output` is a string or path-like object, the function is trying to open a file using a variable `output_path` which is not defined. This will result in a NameError.

To fix this issue, we need to declare the `output_path` variable and set it to the value of `output` when `output` is a string or path-like object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            sys.stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        output_path = output
        def write(s):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
