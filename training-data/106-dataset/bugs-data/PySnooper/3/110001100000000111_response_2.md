Potential error location: Line 26 in the code provided

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error 'NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined' occurs because the variable name used in the 'open' function is incorrect. The correct variable name should be 'output' instead of 'output_path'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Replace 'output_path' with 'output' in the 'open' function to correctly reference the variable.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from typing import Union, BinaryIO
from pathlib import Path

# this is the corrected function
def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, BinaryIO]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, BinaryIO)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
