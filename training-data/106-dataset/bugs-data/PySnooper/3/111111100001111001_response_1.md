The issue here is that the `output_path` variable is not defined in the `get_write_function` function. Also, the variable name should be `output` instead of `output_path` inside the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` function:

```python
import sys
from collections import abc
import os

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (os.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, abc.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

I've also added `os` for the `PathLike` type and `abc` for the `WritableStream` type. Additionally, I modified the variable name to `output` and fixed the condition for checking the `PathLike` type.
