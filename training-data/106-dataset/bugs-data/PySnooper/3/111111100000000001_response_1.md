The potential error location within the `get_write_function` is that the `output_path` variable is not defined inside the `elif` block.

The reason for the bug is that the `output_path` variable is used without being defined. It seems like the intended logic was to use the `output` variable as the file path, but the code mistakenly refers to `output_path`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` within the `elif` block.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
