The error message indicates a NameError, specifically for the variable 'output_path' which is not defined. This suggests that there is a variable mismatch or missing variable within the `get_write_function` function. 

The `get_write_function` function creates different write functions based on the type of the `output` parameter. However, the variable `output_path` is used in the function body without being defined. This is causing the NameError.

To fix this, we need to define the `output_path` variable properly for each case within the `get_write_function` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` function:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path
    
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code, we removed the usage of `output_path` and used the `output` directly as the file path for opening the file. This should fix the NameError issue.
