The error message points to the line `with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file`, indicating a NameError due to `output_path` not being defined. This suggests that the variable `output_path` should have been `output` instead. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code in the `elif` clause that checks if the `output` is an instance of `(pycompat.PathLike, str)`. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` is referenced without being defined, which causes a NameError.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `output_path` with the correct variable `output` within the code block in the `elif` clause.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

By replacing `output_path` with `output` in the `elif` clause, we prevent the NameError from occurring and resolve the issue.
