Potential Error Location:
The issue is with the elif condition for `isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))`. The variable `output_path` is not defined within the function, causing the code to raise an error.

Reason for Bug:
The `output_path` variable is not defined within the function. It should be `output` instead of `output_path`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update `output_path` to `output` in the `elif` condition.
2. Add `import sys` at the beginning of the code to support the use of `sys.stderr`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
