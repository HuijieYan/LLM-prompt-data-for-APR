The error occurs because the variable `output_path` is being used without being defined. This is happening in the `get_write_function` function, where it tries to open the `output_path` for writing when the output is a file path. However, the variable should be named `output` instead of `output_path`.

To fix this issue, the function should use the variable `output` instead of `output_path` when opening the file for writing.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
