The error message indicates a `NameError` for the variable `output_path`, suggesting that it is not defined within the scope of the `write` function. This aligns with the buggy `get_write_function` implementation, as it does not define the variable `output_path` under the `if` condition when `output` is of type `str`.

To fix the bug, we need to define the variable `output_path` under the correct condition. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from io import TextIOWrapper
from typing import Union, TextIO

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIO]) -> TextIOWrapper:
    if output is None:
        def write(s: str):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        output_path = Path(output)
        def write(s: str):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIO)
        def write(s: str):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

This corrected code includes a definition for the `output_path` variable when the `output` is of type `str` or `Path`. This ensures that the `output_path` is properly defined and can be used within the scope of the `write` function.
