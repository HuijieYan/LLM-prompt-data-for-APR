The error is occurring because the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function, leading to a NameError. This is happening in the branch of the if...elif statement where `output` is of type str. The intention is to use the value of `output` as the file path, but the variable name `output_path` is used instead.

To fix the bug, the variable name `output_path` should be replaced with `output` to correctly use the value of the `output` variable as the file path.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Changed output_path to output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected without raising a NameError.
