Potential error location: The `if` statement inside the `get_write_function` is not handling the cases where `output` is `None` or a string/PathLike object correctly.

Reason for the bug: The `if` statement is not properly handling the different cases for the `output` argument, leading to incorrect write functions being defined based on the type of `output`.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Handle the case where `output` is `None` and define the write function accordingly.
2. Handle the case where `output` is a string or PathLike object and define the write function accordingly.
3. Add necessary import statements, such as `import sys` and `from os import PathLike`, if not already included.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
