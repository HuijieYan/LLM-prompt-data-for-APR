Potential Error:
The potential error in the function is the use of the variable output_path in the section of code where output is checked for being a PathLike or str. The correct variable should be output rather than output_path.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the variable output_path is used instead of the correct variable name output. This will result in a NameError as output_path is not defined within the scope of the function.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Replace output_path with output in the section of code where output is checked for being a PathLike or str.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
