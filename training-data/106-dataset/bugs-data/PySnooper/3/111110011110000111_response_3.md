The error message indicates a NameError where `output_path` is not defined. This points to the location in the `get_write_function` where `output_path` is being used.

The error occurred because the variable `output_path` is never defined in the `get_write_function` and it should actually use the `output` variable instead.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function `get_write_function` to use the correct variable name `output` instead of `output_path`. We will also include the necessary imports for `sys` and `pycompat`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
