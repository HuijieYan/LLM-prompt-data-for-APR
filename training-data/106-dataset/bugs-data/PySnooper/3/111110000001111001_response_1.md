The error in the buggy function is that the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output` inside the function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the variable `output_path` is used inside the function instead of the input parameter `output`. This leads to a NameError as `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The variable `output_path` should be replaced with the input parameter `output` inside the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
import utils
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
