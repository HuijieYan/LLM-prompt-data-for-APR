Potential error location: 
The error occurs at the line `with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:` within the section of code `elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function, which leads to the NameError when the function is called with `output` being a string or PathLike object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to change `output_path` to `output` within the problematic section of code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pathlib import Path
from io import IOBase

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, IOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, IOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
In this corrected function, we have replaced `output_path` with `output` within the `open()` function call to resolve the NameError issue. Additionally, we have added type hints to the function signature for better clarity.
