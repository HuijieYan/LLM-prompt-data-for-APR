from typing import Union, TextIO

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, TextIO]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):

            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:

    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIO)
