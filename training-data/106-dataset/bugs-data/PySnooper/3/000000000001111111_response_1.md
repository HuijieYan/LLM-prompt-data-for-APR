The error is occurring due to the reference to the undefined variable 'output_path' inside the function when the output is a path-like string. 

To fix this bug, we need to replace 'output_path' with 'output' inside the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
