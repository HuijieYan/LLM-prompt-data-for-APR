The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined. This error occurs because the variable name `output_path` is used in the function, but it should be `output`.

To fix this issue, the `output_path` variable should be replaced with `output` in the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
