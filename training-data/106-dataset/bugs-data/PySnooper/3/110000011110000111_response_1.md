The error message indicates that the name 'output_path' is not defined, which is causing a NameError in the code. 

The potential error location within the 'get_write_function' is the section where the file is being opened for writing. It seems that there is a mismatch between the variable name used for the file path. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the variable name used to store the file path is 'output' in the function, but 'output_path' is used when trying to open the file. This mismatch in variable names is causing the NameError.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use the correct variable name when opening the file. The corrected code is:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, we have changed the variable name used for opening the file from 'output_path' to 'output', which matches the variable name used to store the file path.
