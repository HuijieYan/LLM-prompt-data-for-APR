1. The test case is attempting to use the `pysnooper.snoop` decorator with a file path `str(path)`. The error message indicates a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `output_path`, suggesting that there is an issue with the handling of the `output` parameter in the `get_write_function` method of the `pysnooper` module.

2. The potential error location is within the `get_write_function` method, specifically in the conditional block where `output` is a file path.

3. The `NameError` occurs because the variable `output_path` is referenced instead of `output` within the function. This leads to the variable `output_path` being undefined, resulting in the error.

4. To fix the bug, the code should use the `output` variable instead of the undefined `output_path` variable. Additionally, the function should be refactored to properly handle the different types of `output` (None, file path, or other types).

5. Updated and corrected code for the `get_write_function` method:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import io
import abc

class PathLike(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def __fspath__(self):
        pass

class WritableStream:
    def write(self, s):
        pass

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected implementation, the variable `output` is used consistently, and the types of `output` are properly handled. This should resolve the `NameError` issue and ensure correct behavior for different types of `output`.
