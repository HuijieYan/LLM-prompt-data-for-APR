The error message indicates that there is a `NameError` due to the variable `output_path` not being defined. This error occurs within the `get_write_function` method when trying to open a file.

The potential error location within the `get_write_function` method is in the conditional block where `output` is of type `str`. In this block, `output_path` should be replaced with just `output` to resolve the `NameError`.

The bug occurred because the variable `output_path` was referenced instead of `output` in the conditional block for strings. This caused the `NameError` as `output_path` was not defined.

To fix this bug, the variable `output_path` should be replaced with just `output` in the conditional block where `output` is of type `str` in the `get_write_function` method.

The corrected code for the `get_write_function` method is as follows:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import pysnooper.utils as utils


def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
