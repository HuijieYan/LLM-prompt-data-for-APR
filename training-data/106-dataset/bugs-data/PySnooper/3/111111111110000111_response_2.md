The error message "NameError: name 'output_path' is not defined" suggests that there is a variable called 'output_path' that is being used without being defined. Looking at the provided buggy function `get_write_function`, it becomes clear that the error is due to the variable 'output_path' not being defined within the branching logic of the function.

The buggy function 'get_write_function' is designed to return different 'write' functions based on the type of 'output' passed to it. The bug exists in the 'elif' branch that checks if the 'output' is a string or a PathLike object. In this branch, the code attempts to use 'output_path' without defining it first, leading to the NameError.

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name from 'output_path' to 'output' inside the 'elif' branch. This will allow us to use the 'output' variable passed as an argument to the 'get_write_function' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_write_function' function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

# corrected function
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With this correction, the function should now work as intended without raising the NameError when trying to access the 'output_path' variable.
