The buggy function `get_write_function` is designed to return different `write` functions based on the type of the `output` parameter. 

The issue is that in the `if ... elif ... else` cascade, the `write` function is redefined each time, but it should be a single function that is conditionally modified based on the type of `output`.

To fix this issue, we can define a single `write` function with conditional behavior inside it based on the type of `output`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code, we define a single `write` function within `get_write_function`. The conditional behavior is defined within this single `write` function based on the type of the `output` parameter.
