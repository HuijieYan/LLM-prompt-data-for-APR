The error "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" suggests that there is an issue with the variable name 'output_path' not being defined. Looking at the code, it seems that there is a typo in the line where the file is being opened.

The bug occurs because in the case where `output` is a string, the variable `output_path` is used instead of the correct variable name `output`. This leads to the NameError as 'output_path' is not defined anywhere in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` in the line:

```python
with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
```

The corrected line should be:

```python
with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
```

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union


def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):  # using Path instead of pycompat.PathLike
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # using output instead of output_path
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With this correction, the function should work as expected without raising any NameError.
