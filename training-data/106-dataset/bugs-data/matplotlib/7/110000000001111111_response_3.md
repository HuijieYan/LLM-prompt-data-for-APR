The issue is occurring when the intensity is a masked array, and the code attempts to access the `mask` attribute of the intensity array to apply a mask to the `blend` array. However, it encounters an `IndexError` as the `intensity.mask` has a different structure than expected.

To fix this issue, the code needs to handle the case where intensity is a masked array. We should only apply the mask if it is a 2D array, indicating valid values.

The corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method is provided below:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Rest of the code remains the same...
    """

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and len(intensity.mask.shape) == 2:
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition `len(intensity.mask.shape) == 2` is added to check if the mask is a 2D array. If it is, then the mask is applied to the `blend` array, otherwise, no mask is applied.

This change ensures that the code handles the case where the `intensity` array is a masked array correctly, addressing the bug where the code encounters an `IndexError` due to mismatched array structures.
