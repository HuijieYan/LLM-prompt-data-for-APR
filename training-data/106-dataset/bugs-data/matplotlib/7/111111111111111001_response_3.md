The error seems to be caused by the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the function. This line is trying to access the mask attribute of the intensity variable and then attempting to access the first element of it. The error message "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable" suggests that the intensity.mask is a scalar instead of an array.

The potential reason for this bug could be that the intensity variable is not a masked array, which is causing the intensity.mask attribute to be a scalar. It's possible that the intensity variable is intended to be a masked array, but it is not being created or handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to ensure that the intensity variable is always a masked array. This can be done by explicitly converting it to a masked array if it's not already one. Additionally, we should handle the case where intensity.mask is a scalar instead of an array.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
from numpy.ma import MaskedArray

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv', vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    if not isinstance(intensity, MaskedArray):
        intensity = MaskedArray(intensity)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'.format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply the result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if intensity.mask is not np.ma.nomask:
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code:
- We explicitly check if the intensity variable is a masked array, and if it's not, we convert it to a MaskedArray.
- We added a check for intensity.mask not being np.ma.nomask to handle the case where intensity.mask is a scalar.

With these changes, the function should now handle both masked and unmasked intensity arrays correctly and prevent the IndexError that was occurring.
