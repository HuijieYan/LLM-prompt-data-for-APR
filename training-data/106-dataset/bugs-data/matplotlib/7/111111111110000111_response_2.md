The error occurs at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the `shade_rgb` function. The issue arises because the `intensity` variable is a scalar, and trying to access its mask property with an index of 0 causes an `IndexError`.

The bug is related to the handling of `intensity` when it is a scalar value instead of an array. The `shade_rgb` function assumes that `intensity` will always be an array, but in some cases, it can be a scalar due to the calculation logic of `hillshade`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in the `shade_rgb` function to handle both array and scalar `intensity` values. When `intensity` is a scalar, it should not be treated as an array with a mask property.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    if not isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        intensity = np.clip(intensity, 0, 1)[..., np.newaxis]
    else:
        intensity = intensity.data[..., np.newaxis]
    
    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to verify if `intensity` is not a masked array. If that's the case, we apply the `np.clip` operation and convert it to a masked array. Otherwise, we use the data directly. We also updated the logic to apply the result only where hillshade intensity isn't masked if `intensity` is a masked array.
