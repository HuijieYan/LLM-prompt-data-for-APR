The error occurs in the `shade_rgb` method while accessing the `mask` attribute of the `intensity` variable. The error message indicates an IndexError due to an invalid index to a scalar variable.

The bug occurs because the intensity variable is defined as an ndarray when `hillshade` is called, but it is later being treated as a masked array. This discrepancy in type causes the issue when trying to access the `mask` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `intensity` variable is consistently treated as a masked array when required. This can be achieved by explicitly converting the intensity array into a masked array with an appropriate mask before using it as such.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import numpy.ma as ma

class LightSource():
    # ... other methods ...

    def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
                  vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
        intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
        intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

        # Convert intensity to a masked array
        mask = np.isnan(intensity)  # Define a mask based on the NaN values in intensity
        intensity = ma.array(intensity, mask=mask)  # Convert intensity to a masked array

        # Rest of the code remains the same
        lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
        }
        if blend_mode in lookup:
            blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        else:
            try:
                blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
            except TypeError as err:
                raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                                 .format(lookup.keys)) from err

        # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
        if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
            mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
            for i in range(3):
                blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

        return blend
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert the `intensity` array to a masked array using `numpy.ma.array` with the `mask` argument set to the mask derived from the NaN values in the intensity array. This ensures that the `mask` attribute can be safely accessed without causing an IndexError.
