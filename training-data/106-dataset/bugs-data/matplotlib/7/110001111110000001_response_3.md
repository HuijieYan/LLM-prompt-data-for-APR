The error occurs when attempting to access the `mask` attribute of the `intensity` variable inside the `shade_rgb` function. The error message indicates an "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable." This implies that the `intensity` variable is being treated as a scalar when it should be an array.

The bug occurred because the `intensity` variable is being set to the result of the `hillshade` function, which is assumed to return an array. However, the error suggests that `intensity` is actually a scalar value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `hillshade` function returns an array and that the `intensity` variable is properly shaped as an array.

Here's the corrected `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    ... (other parameters and docstring comments remain unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = np.atleast_3d(self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction))

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `np.atleast_3d` to ensure that the result of the `hillshade` function is reshaped into an array, even if it is a 2D array.
- The blending process and the handling of masked intensity values remain unchanged.
