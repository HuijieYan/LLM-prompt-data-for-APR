The bug in the `shade_rgb` method appears to be related to the handling of masked arrays. The error message "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable" suggests that when trying to access the mask attribute of the intensity array, it's encountering an issue.

The bug is likely occurring in the following section of the code:
```python
# Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
    mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
    for i in range(3):
        blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
```
The issue may be related to the `intensity.mask` attribute, which is not being handled correctly when trying to access it with the `[..., 0]` syntax.

To fix this bug, the code can be adjusted to properly handle masked arrays as follows:
```python
# Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
if np.ma.is_masked(intensity):
    mask = intensity.mask
    for i in range(3):
        blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
```
In this corrected code snippet, the `np.ma.is_masked()` function is used to check if the intensity array is a masked array. If it is, the mask is directly assigned to the `mask` variable, and the subsequent operations are performed using this mask.

Here's the full corrected `shade_rgb` method with the fix included:
```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if np.ma.is_masked(intensity):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
