The error message "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable" indicates that the code is trying to index a scalar value as if it were an array. This is likely occurring at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the `shade_rgb` method.

The error is occurring because the `intensity` variable is being treated as an array, but it may actually be a scalar value in some cases, specifically when `intensity` is a masked array.

To fix this bug, we should only apply the masking logic if `intensity` is a masked array. We can use the `np.ma.is_masked` function to check if `intensity` is a masked array, and only perform the masking logic if it is.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    ... (other comments remain the same) ...
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if np.ma.isMA(intensity):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
