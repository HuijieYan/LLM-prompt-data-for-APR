The error occurs when the function tries to access the 'mask' attribute of the 'intensity' variable. The error message indicates an IndexError: invalid index to a scalar variable.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'intensity' variable is being treated as if it were a masked array, but it is actually a regular ndarray. This leads to the attempt to access the 'mask' attribute resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle masked arrays separately from regular ndarrays. This can be achieved by checking the type of 'intensity' and applying the appropriate logic based on whether it is a masked array or not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'shade_rgb':

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    ... (parameters and description)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

By incorporating the check for the type of 'intensity' and handling masked arrays appropriately, the bug should be fixed. This updated code will ensure that the correct logic is applied based on whether 'intensity' is a masked array or a regular ndarray, thus preventing the IndexError.
