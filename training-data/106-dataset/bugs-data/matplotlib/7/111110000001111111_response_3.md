The issue arises with the `shade_rgb` method when it encounters a masked array. The error message indicates an `IndexError` related to the `intensity.mask` attribute when calculating the mask for the blend process.

The issue is likely caused by the presence of a masked array, which does not have the expected 2D mask attribute as assumed by the code.

To fix this bug, the code should handle the masked array appropriately by considering the mask attribute.

The corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method is as follows:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Handle masked array
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        intensity = np.ma.array(intensity, mask=mask)

    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    return blend
```
