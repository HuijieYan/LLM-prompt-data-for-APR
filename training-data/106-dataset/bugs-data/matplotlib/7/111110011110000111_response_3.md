The test case calls the `mcolors.LightSource.shade` method with a masked array `z1`. The error occurs when `shade_rgb` method tries to access the `intensity.mask` attribute using the indexing operation `intensity.mask[..., 0]`, which results in an IndexError due to the `intensity.mask` being a scalar variable.

The bug occurs because the `shade_rgb` method expects the `intensity` variable to have a mask attribute with a 2D shape, but it receives a scalar variable instead when the input is a masked array.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the case when the `intensity` variable is a scalar, and adjust the logic to work correctly with both masked arrays and non-masked arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    ... (other method documentation remains unchanged) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }

    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError(f'"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {lookup.keys()}') from err

    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and intensity.mask.ndim == 2:
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

With the provided fix, the `shade_rgb` method now checks whether `intensity` has a mask attribute and its dimensions are 2D before accessing the mask. If the mask attribute exists and is 2D, the method applies the result where the hillshade intensity isn't masked. If these conditions are not met, the method skips the mask application, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
