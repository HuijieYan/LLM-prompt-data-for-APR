The error occurs when the `intensity` variable is defined as a masked array, resulting in the `intensity.mask` attribute being a scalar instead of a 2D array, which leads to an IndexError when the `intensity.mask[..., 0]` expression is executed.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to check if `intensity` is a masked array and handle it accordingly. If `intensity` is a masked array, use the `intensity.mask` attribute directly for masking operations. If not, just proceed with the regular blending operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err
    
    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
    
    return blend
```

In this corrected code:
- The `hasattr(intensity, 'mask')` check is used to determine if `intensity` is a masked array.
- If `intensity` is a masked array, the `intensity.mask` attribute is used for masking operations.
- The loop has been updated to handle masking for each color channel individually. If `intensity.mask` is `True` at a certain location, the corresponding values in `blend` will be replaced by the original `rgb` values at that location.

This updated approach should resolve the IndexError that was occurring when `intensity` was a masked array, allowing the `shade_rgb` function to work with masked arrays without errors.
