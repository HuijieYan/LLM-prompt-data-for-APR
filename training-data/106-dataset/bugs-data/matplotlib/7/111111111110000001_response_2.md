The error is occurring in the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class. The error message indicates that the issue is with the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`, which is causing an IndexError.

The potential cause of this issue is that the `intensity` variable does not have a mask attribute, hence trying to access the `mask` attribute is raising an IndexError.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be updated to check if the `intensity` variable is a masked array before attempting to access its mask attribute. If it is not a masked array, then no further action is needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rgb : array-like
        An (M, N, 3) RGB array, assumed to be in the range of 0 to 1.
    ... (other parameters)
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and intensity.mask is not None:
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, before accessing the mask attribute of the intensity array, there is a check to see if `intensity` has a mask attribute and if it is not None. This prevents the IndexError when the mask attribute is absent.
