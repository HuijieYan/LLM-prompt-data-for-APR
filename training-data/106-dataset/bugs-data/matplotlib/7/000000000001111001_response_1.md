The function `shade_rgb` is meant to blend a hillshade with an RGB dataset using the specified blending mode. The bug occurs when the intensity mask is not handled properly, leading to errors in the resultant blended image.

The problematic part of the code is the conditional logic that adjusts blend values based on the intensity mask. The bug occurs because the conditional loop checking for `intensity.mask` is trying to access the `.mask` attribute directly, which is not implemented for regular numpy arrays. It is likely that the input elevation data is being converted to a masked array in certain cases, which triggers this issue.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check if the `intensity` is a masked array and then handle the mask accordingly. If it's a masked array, use its internal mask attribute. If not, create a mask based on the intensity values. Another approach could involve using try-except blocks to handle the attribute access and conditionally applying masks.

The corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function is as follows:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):

    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
    elif isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
In the corrected code, the conditional check has been extended to handle masked arrays, and a separate branch is created to handle the mask based on whether `intensity` is a masked array or not.
