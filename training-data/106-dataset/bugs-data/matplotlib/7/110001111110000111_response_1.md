Issue Analysis:
The error occurs in the shade_rgb function when the intensity.mask attribute is being accessed with an invalid index. This leads to the IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable error. The error occurs due to the np.clip function returning a masked array with attribute mask=False, while shade_rgb expects the mask attribute to be 2D in order to access it with the indexing syntax intensity.mask[..., 0].

Error Location:
The potential error location is identified in the shade_rgb function where intensity.mask attribute is accessed.

Reason behind the Bug:
The np.clip function returns a masked array with the attribute mask=False. This causes a discrepancy in accessing the mask attribute when the shade_rgb function expects it to be 2D.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the np.clip function to return a masked array with the correct 2D mask attribute.
2. Handle the masked array attributes appropriately within the shade_rgb function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Other parameters are the same as the original function.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and len(intensity.mask.shape) > 1:  # Check if the mask attribute has 2D shape
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
In the corrected code, the issue with accessing the mask attribute of the intensity variable is addressed by checking if the attribute has 2D shape before performing the indexing operation. If the mask attribute has 2D shape, then it is used to apply the result to the blend array.
