The bug occurs when trying to access the 'mask' attribute of an ndarray. The bug refers to intensity.mask, where intensity is an ndarray. This suggests that the function is trying to access the 'mask' attribute for a regular ndarray, which does not have this attribute.

To fix the bug, we should check if the intensity variable is a MaskedArray before accessing the 'mask' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    ... (omitted documentation) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    import numpy as np
    from numpy.ma import MaskedArray

    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, MaskedArray) and hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

The corrected code includes a check to see if the 'intensity' variable is a MaskedArray before using the 'mask' attribute. If it is, then the masking operation can proceed as before. If not, it will skip this operation and return the 'blend' variable as is.
