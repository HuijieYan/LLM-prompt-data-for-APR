The error occurs when attempting to access the 'mask' attribute of the 'intensity' variable. This suggests that the 'intensity' variable might not be a masked array and thus doesn't have a 'mask' attribute, causing an IndexError.

The potential error lies in the conditional statement that checks for the presence of a mask in the 'intensity' variable.

The bug occurred because the code does not account for the possibility that 'intensity' might not be a masked array, leading to an IndexError when trying to access its 'mask' attribute without checking for its type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to check if 'intensity' is an instance of a masked array before attempting to access its 'mask' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the 'shade_rgb' function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    ... (other comments remain the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray) and hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

By adding the `isinstance` check for `np.ma.MaskedArray`, we ensure that the 'mask' attribute is only accessed if 'intensity' is indeed a masked array, preventing the IndexError.
