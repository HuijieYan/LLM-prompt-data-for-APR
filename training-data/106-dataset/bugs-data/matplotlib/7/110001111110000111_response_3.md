The error is occurring in the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class in the `matplotlib.colors` module. The error specifically happens at the following line:
```python
mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
```
The issue is raised because `intensity` is a scalar variable, not an array, and therefore cannot be indexed with `[...]`.

The bug occurs because `intensity` is being treated as an array in the `shade_rgb` method, leading to the attempt to access its mask attribute as if it were an array.

To fix this bug, the `shade_rgb` method should handle both scalar and array intensity properly. The `mask` attribute extraction should be conditional on whether `intensity` is a scalar or an array.

Here's the corrected `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    ... (other parameters and description) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }

    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        if intensity.ndim > 0:  # Check if intensity is an array
            mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
            for i in range(3):
                blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
        else:
            if intensity.mask:  # Check if intensity is a scalar with mask
                for i in range(3):
                    blend[..., i] = rgb[..., i]

    return blend
```

With this fix, the `shade_rgb` method now checks the dimensionality of `intensity` and appropriately handles both scalar and array cases when applying the mask.
