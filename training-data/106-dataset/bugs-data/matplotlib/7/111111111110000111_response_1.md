The test case `test_light_source_shading_empty_mask` is designed to use the `shade` method of the `LightSource` class to create shaded relief maps. The `shade` method then calls the `shade_rgb` method to perform actual shading. However, the error occurs in the `shade_rgb` method, specifically at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` which leads to an `IndexError`.

The reason for the error is that the `intensity` array is being treated as a scalar variable, but it is actually a 3D array (computed as intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]). Therefore, the code tries to access the `mask` attribute of a scalar variable, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the intensity array is handled properly and that its mask attribute is accessed in a valid manner. This can be achieved by checking whether `intensity` is a masked array before accessing its mask attribute. If it is not a masked array, it should be converted to one before proceeding.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.
    ...
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Ensure intensity is a masked array
    if not isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        intensity = np.ma.array(intensity, mask=False)

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `intensity` array is already a masked array. If it's not, we convert it to a masked array with no mask. Then, we handle the blending of `rgb` and `intensity` using the specified blend mode.

This correction ensures that the `shade_rgb` method properly handles the `intensity` array and avoids the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
