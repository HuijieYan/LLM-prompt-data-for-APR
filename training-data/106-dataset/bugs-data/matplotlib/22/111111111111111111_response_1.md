This bug seems to be related to the handling of datetime objects when used as bin edges in the `pyplot.hist` function. The error is caused by a type promotion issue where the comparison between float and datetime.datetime objects is not supported.

One potential issue might be the internal conversion of datetime objects to floats, leading to mixed types in array operation. This issue may result from the fact that the `numpy.histogram` function does not handle datetime arrays as bin edges correctly.

To fix this bug, the handling of datetime objects in the `numpy.histogram` function should be improved. This may involve converting datetime bin edges to numerical values before performing the histogram computation. Additionally, the code needs to ensure that inputs and bin edges are of the same type to prevent mixed type operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `hist` function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    
    # ... (previous code)

    if bins is not None and isinstance(bins[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, weights=w[i], **hist_kwargs)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, the function checks if the provided bins are datetime objects and then converts them to numerical values using the `mpl.dates.date2num` function before passing them to the `np.histogram` function.

This modification ensures that the bin edges are consistently of the same type and prevents mixed-type comparisons and operations, addressing the type promotion error.
