The error "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" is occurring because the bin edges are in the `datetime.datetime` format, and they need to be explicitly cast or converted to a numeric representation.

The following corrected version of the function involved will fix this issue:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, weights=None, **kwargs):

    # additional code...

    if not isinstance(bins, np.ndarray):
        bins = np.asarray(bins).astype('datetime64')

    # additional code...

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

In the corrected function, if the `bins` are not of type `np.ndarray`, it explicitly casts them to the `datetime64` type using `astype`. This casting resolves the "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" issue by ensuring the bin edges are in the correct format for numeric comparison.
