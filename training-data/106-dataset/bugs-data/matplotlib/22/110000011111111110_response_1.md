    Plot a histogram.

    Compute and draw the histogram of *x*.  The return value is a tuple
    (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
    *patches1*,...]) if the input contains multiple data.  See the
    documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
    already-binned data.

    Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
    of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
    a 2-D ndarray in which each column is a dataset.  Note that
    the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.

    Masked arrays are not supported.

    The *bins*, *range*, *weights*, and *density* parameters behave as in
    `numpy.histogram`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
        arrays which are not required to be of the same length.

    bins : int or sequence or str, optional
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
        in the range.

        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
        left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
        in this case, bins may be unequally spaced. All but the last
        (righthand-most) bin is half-open. In other words, if *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
        supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges`: 'auto', 'fd', 'doane',
        'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.
        The accepted sequence values include numpy datetime64

        The default is :rc:`hist.bins`.

    range : tuple or None, optional
        The lower and upper range of the bins. Lower and upper outliers
        are ignored. If not provided, *range* is ``(x.min(), x.max())``.
        Range has no effect if *bins* is a sequence.

        If *bins* is a sequence or *range* is specified, autoscaling
        is based on the specified bin range instead of the
        range of x.

        Default is ``None``

    density : bool, optional
