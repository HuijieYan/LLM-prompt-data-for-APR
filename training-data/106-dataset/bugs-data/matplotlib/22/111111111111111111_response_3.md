# Analyzing the issue

The error occurs when trying to use a list of datetime objects as the bin edges in the `plt.hist()` function call. The error message indicates a type promotion issue, with a comparison between a float and a datetime object.

The underlying problem seems to be related to the handling of datetime objects and their conversion to numeric values for binning purposes. It appears that the `plt.hist()` function does not handle lists of date or datetime objects as the bin edges.

# Potential Error Location

The error is likely occurring in the `ax.hist()` function, specifically in the handling of datetime bin edges.

# Reasons behind the Bug

The issue arises from a discrepancy between the input data type and the expected bin edge data type in the `ax.hist()` function. The code might be attempting to compare a float value to a datetime object, resulting in the TypeError.

# Possible Approaches

1. Check the code to ensure that the type of bin edges aligns with the type of input data.
2. Ensure proper conversion of datetime objects to numeric values for bin edges.
3. Handle the bin edge type and conversion in a consistent manner to avoid type promotion issues.

# Corrected Code

The code should be modified to handle datetime bin edges correctly and consistently. Here's the corrected code for the `ax.hist()` function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(bins, list) and isinstance(bins[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bin edges to numeric values

    # Proceed with the rest of the function as before
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the bins are a list of datetime objects. If so, it converts the datetime bin edges to numeric values using the `mpl.dates.date2num()` function. This approach ensures a consistent type for the bin edges and avoids type promotion issues.
