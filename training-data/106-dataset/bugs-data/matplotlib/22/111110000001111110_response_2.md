# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    """
    The `Axes` contains most of the figure elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
    `~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
    and sets the coordinate system.
    
    The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
    is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
    are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
    func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    dataLim : `.Bbox`
        The bounding box enclosing all data displayed in the Axes.
    viewLim : `.Bbox`
        The view limits in data coordinates.

```
The issue seems to relate to problems in the type conversion for the datetime bins. When datetime is used as bins for the hist function, it generates a type promotion error. In the corrected code, we perform a type check and conversion for the datetime bins.
