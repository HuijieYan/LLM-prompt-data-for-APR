The error occurs when the `hist` function tries to use `np.histogram` to compute the histogram. The error message "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" indicates that there is a comparison between a 'float' and a 'datetime.datetime' type.

This comparison issue arises because the `np.histogram` function internally uses the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function, which has a comparison that is causing the error. This comparison occurs when trying to sort the bin edges against the data points in the `a.searchsorted(v[:-1], 'left')` and `a.searchsorted(v[-1:], 'right')` lines.

To fix this issue, a potential approach would be to preprocess the `datetime.datetime` bins using the `bins_preprocess` function to convert the bin edges into an appropriate numerical form that can be used for sorting and comparison.

The corrected code for the `hist` function is as follows:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
            
    # ... (omitted code)

    if bins is None:
        bins = rcParams['hist.bins']

    # Preprocess bins
    if bins_preprocess is not None:
        bins = bins_preprocess(bins)

    # ... (omitted code)

    # Compute and sort the histogram
    m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins, weights=weights, **hist_kwargs)

    # ... (omitted code)
    
    return m, bins, cbook.silent_list('Patch', patches)
```

This corrected code preprocesses the `bins` using the `bins_preprocess` function (if provided) to ensure that the bin edges are appropriately transformed for comparison and sorting. This helps to avoid the comparison errors related to sorting datetime values.
