The error occurs when the `np.histogram` function is called inside the `hist` method of the `AxesSubplot` class. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError stating that '<' is not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'. This suggests there might be a comparison operation between a float and a datetime object, which is not allowed.

The reason behind the bug is likely to be related to the data type conversion between date-time objects and numerical values. It seems that the computation inside the `hist` method is not handling date-time objects correctly.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the date-time data is properly handled and converted before being used for histogram computation. This involves validating the data type of the input x and ensuring that date-time objects are properly converted to numerical values before being used in the histogram computation.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
from numbers import Number
from collections.abc import Iterable
import numpy as np

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code omitted) ...

    if np.isscalar(x) or not isinstance(x, Iterable):
        x = [x]

    # Convert date-time objects to numerical values
    if isinstance(x[0], Number) and isinstance(x[0], Number):
        x = [np.array(x_i).astype('datetime64[D]').astype(int) for x_i in x]
    else:
        x = [np.array([x_ij.astype('datetime64[D]').astype(int) for x_ij in x_i]) for x_i in x]

    if bins is None:
        bins = rcParams['hist.bins']

    # Validate other input parameters and perform histogram computation
    # ...

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

In the revised code, we first ensure that the input `x` is properly converted to numerical values if it contains date-time objects. We also handle the situation where `x` is a single array or a sequence of arrays. After these modifications, the function should be able to handle date-time data correctly and avoid the TypeError that was previously encountered.
