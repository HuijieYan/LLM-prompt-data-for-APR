The issue arises when trying to use a list of date or datetime objects as bin edges. The third call to plt.hist fails with a TypeError related to comparisons between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The potential error location lies in the hist function of the Axes class, where the bin ranges are handled. The failure occurs due to type incompatibility between datetime objects and floats during the binning operation.

The bug occurs because the histogram function does not handle datetime objects correctly when used as bin edges. Instead of treating them as categorical labels representing specific intervals, it attempts to perform arithmetic operations involving datetime objects and floats, leading to a type promotion error.

To fix the bug, the histogram function needs to be modified to handle datetime objects as bin edges correctly. This involves identifying datetime ranges, ensuring that appropriate comparisons and operations are performed when binning datetime data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # Addition for processing datetime bin edges
    if all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Existing code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In this fix, an additional check is included to detect if the bin edges consist of datetime objects. If this condition is satisfied, the datetime bin edges are converted to numerical values using mpl.dates.date2num before proceeding with the histogram generation.

This modification ensures that datetime objects are properly handled during the histogram operation, resolving the type promotion error.
