This bug seems to be related to the passing of a list of datetime objects as bin edges to the `hist` method of `matplotlib.pyplot`. The issue arises when passing the list of datetime objects directly as the bins, resulting in a TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely where the bins are used and compared with the data values, resulting in the type promotion error between float and datetime.datetime.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to the handling of datetime objects as bin edges within the `hist` method. It seems that the method does not handle datetime objects directly in this context, leading to the type promotion error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include modifying the `hist` method to handle datetime objects as bin edges properly, ensuring that comparisons and operations involving bins and data values account for datetime objects. Additionally, providing a mechanism for datetime bin edge conversion internally within the `hist` method could resolve the type promotion error seen in the bug.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
# Assuming `mpl.dates.date2num` is used to convert the datetime objects to numbers for bins
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(val, datetime) for val in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)
    # rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By explicitly checking the type of the bins and converting them using `mpl.dates.date2num` if they are a list of datetime objects, we can ensure that the type promotion error between float and datetime.datetime is resolved.
