The error occurs when attempting to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges in the hist function from the matplotlib library. The error message indicates that the '<' operator is not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime', which points to an issue with data type conversion and comparison between float and datetime objects.

The potential error location within the hist function is in the block of code responsible for computing and processing the histogram bin edges. This is suggested by the error message that refers to a part of the code that is responsible for sorting and comparing the bin edges.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle datetime bin edges properly, causing a type promotion error during the comparison operation in the underlying NumPy histogram computations.

To fix the bug, the hist function needs to correctly handle datetime bin edges by ensuring that datetime objects are properly converted and handled in a way that is compatible with NumPy's histogram computations. This may involve explicitly converting datetime bin edges to a numeric representation before passing them to NumPy's histogram function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    
    # Code for handling datetime bins explicitly to avoid type promotion error
    if bins is not None and all(isinstance(b, datetime.datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Existing code omitted for brevity
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    """
```

In the corrected code, a conditional check is added to detect if the bins are datetime objects, and if so, they are explicitly converted to numeric representation using the date2num function from the mpl.dates module before further processing. This approach ensures that the datetime bin edges are handled correctly to avoid the type promotion error.
