The error occurs when the `hist` function is called with `datetime` data and `numpy.histogram` internally calls the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison operator `'<'` is not supported between instances of `float` and `datetime.datetime`.

This occurs because when `numpy.histogram` uses `_search_sorted_inclusive` to sort the bin edges, it expects these bin edges to be comparable with each other using comparison operators like `'<'`. However, the bin edges here contain `datetime` objects and hence the direct comparison is not supported.

To fix this error, the bin edges should be converted to a format that can be compared. For example, when using `date2num` on `datetime` objects, the bin edges are converted to numbers and can be compared directly.

Here's the corrected `hist` function code:

```python
import numpy as np

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Convert date bins to numbers using date2num
    if isinstance(bins, mpl.dates.date2num) or callable(bins):
        bins = bins(date_edges)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the `datetime` bin edges are converted to numbers using `date2num` before being used in the `np.histogram` call. This conversion ensures that the bin edges can be compared within the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function without resulting in a TypeError.
