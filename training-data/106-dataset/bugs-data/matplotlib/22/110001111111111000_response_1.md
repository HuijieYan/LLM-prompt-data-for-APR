The buggy function causes a TypeError in both test cases. The issue seems to be the use of a searchsorted function, which is throwing a "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'". 

The bug can be fixed by converting datetime objects in date_edges to 'np.datetime64' using bins_preprocess function before bins is called in the histogram function. Below is the corrected Method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    date_edges = bins
    if bins is not None and callable(bins):
        date_edges = bins(bins_preprocess(date_edges))
    # ... omitted code ...
```
