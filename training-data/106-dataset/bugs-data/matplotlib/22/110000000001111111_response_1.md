The error is occurring in the `hist` method of the `AxesSubplot` object in the `matplotlib` library. The issue is likely related to the fact that the `datetime` objects are not being handled correctly when used as bin edges in the `plt.hist` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `plt.hist` function does not handle `datetime` objects correctly when used as bin edges. This leads to the TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

To fix the bug, the `plt.hist` function needs to be modified to handle `datetime` objects properly, especially when used as bin edges. This may require converting the `datetime` bin edges to an appropriate format that can be used for histogram calculations.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `hist` method in the `matplotlib` library:

```python
# Fixed function
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
 
  # ... (existing implementation code)

  if isinstance(bins[0], datetime.datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

  # ... (remaining implementation code)

  # ... (return statement)    
```

In this corrected implementation, before processing the histogram, we check if the bins are of type `datetime.datetime`. If they are, we convert them to a numerical representation using `mpl.dates.date2num` to ensure compatibility with the histogram calculations.

By making this change, the function will correctly handle `datetime` bin edges, resolving the TypeError experienced when using `datetime` bin edges.
