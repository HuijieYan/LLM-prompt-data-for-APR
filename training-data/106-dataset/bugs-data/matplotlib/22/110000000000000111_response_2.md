The error "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'" seems to be occurring in the `hist` function of the `matplotlib` library. This error occurs when trying to use a list of date or datetime objects as bin edges in the `plt.hist` function call, resulting in a type promotion error.

The potential error location within the `hist` function is likely in the part where the bins are being processed, causing the conversion of date or datetime objects to float and leading to the type promotion error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `hist` function does not handle date or datetime objects appropriately for bin edges, leading to unintended type promotion and subsequent errors.

To fix the bug, the `hist` function needs to be updated to handle date or datetime objects as bin edges correctly and avoid the type promotion error. This may involve converting the bin edges to an appropriate format that can be compared to date or datetime objects, ensuring that the comparison between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime' is avoided.

The corrected code for the `hist` function should include specific handling for date or datetime objects as bin edges to prevent unintended type promotions and ensure the proper comparison is made between the bin edges and the date or datetime objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates

def hist(self, dates, date_edges):
    date_edges = mdates.date2num(date_edges)
    plt.hist(dates, bins=date_edges)
```

In this corrected code, the `mdates.date2num` function is used to convert the date edges to an appropriate format for comparison with date objects. The `plt.hist` function is then called with the converted date edges to avoid type promotion errors.
