The error occurs when the `numpy.histogram` function is called inside the `hist` method of the `Axes` class. The error message is "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'."

The reason behind this error is that the bin edges (`date_edges`) are being passed as a list of `datetime` objects to the `numpy.histogram` function. The issue is that the bin edges need to be in a format that supports comparisons such as float or integer, but `datetime` objects cannot be directly compared with typical comparison operators like '<'.

To fix this issue, the `date_edges` need to be converted to a numerical format before being passed to the `numpy.histogram` function. One way to achieve this is using the `mpl.dates.date2num` function, which converts an array of `datetime` objects to an array of floating point numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the `hist` method:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", 'weights'], label_namer="x")
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Plot a histogram.
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """

    # Add this line to convert the datetime bin edges to floating point numbers
    if bins is not None and isinstance(bins[0], datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the check and conversion for `datetime` bin edges, the function will now properly handle the `datetime` bin edges and avoid the TypeError that was occurring previously.
