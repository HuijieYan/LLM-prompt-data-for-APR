1. The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` is trying to set the x-axis ticks to [.3, .7] and then check if the x-axis limits have been correctly inverted. However, the test fails because the expected value `(1, 0)` does not match the actual value `(0.7, 0.3)`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` method, specifically the logic for updating the limits based on the new values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

3. The bug occurs because the logic for updating the limits in the `setter` method is not correctly handling the inversion of the limits when they are set. As a result, the test case is failing to correctly assert the expected limits after setting the ticks.

4. To fix the bug, handling of the inversion of the limits when setting new values should be improved. Additionally, the logic for comparison in the test case should also be updated to reflect the correct expected limits after inversion.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        limits = getattr(self, lim_name)
        if ignore:
            setattr(limits, attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                limits.set(attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                limits.set(attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With the corrected code, the bug related to setting and comparing inverted axis limits should be fixed.
