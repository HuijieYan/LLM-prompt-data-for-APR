The error message indicates that the `get_xlim` function returns the incorrect tuple (0.7, 0.3) instead of the expected (1, 0). This suggests that there is a bug in the `_make_getset_interval` function causing the incorrect calculation of the x-axis limits.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the `setter` function. The algorithm in the setter function is supposed to compare the old minimum and maximum values with the new `vmin` and `vmax` values, and then update the limits accordingly. However, the current implementation is failing to do that correctly.

To fix this bug, the code in the `setter` function needs to be revised. Instead of recursively calling the `setter` function, we can directly alter the behavior of the `get_{method_name}_interval` and `set_{method_name}_interval` methods. Additionally, we should ensure that the logic for comparing the old and new limits is properly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `getter` and `setter` functions:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                newmin, newmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                newmin, newmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)

            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (newmin, newmax))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these changes, the `setter` function directly updates the x-axis limits based on the comparison of old and new values, and the problem with the incorrect x-axis limits should be resolved.
