1. The test case involves creating a plot, inverting the x-axis, setting tick values, and then checking if the x-axis limits have updated accordingly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `setter` method. It seems the logic for updating the x-axis limits after setting tick values is incorrect, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

3. The bug occurs because the `setter` method is not correctly updating the x-axis limits based on the new tick values. It is not handling the inversion of the x-axis properly.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `setter` method to correctly update the x-axis limits based on the tick values, taking into account the inversion of the axis.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the logic within the `setter` method has been modified to correctly handle the inversion of the x-axis and update the limits based on the tick values.
