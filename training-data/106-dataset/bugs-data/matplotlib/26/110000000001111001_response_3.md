The issue in the given function is that the 'getter' and 'setter' functions are calling themselves recursively, which is causing a recursive loop and will lead to a 'RecursionError' at runtime.

The reason for the occurrence of this bug is that when the 'setter' function is called, it calls itself recursively, which is not intended.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the 'setter' function to call the 'getter' function instead of calling itself recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """
    
    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_vmin = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_vmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmin, new_vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
