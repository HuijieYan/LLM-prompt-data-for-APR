The issue seems to be related to the incorrect implementation of the `setter` function inside the `_make_getset_interval` method. The `setter` function is called recursively without any base case to stop the recursion, leading to a potential infinite loop and ultimately causing a stack overflow error.

To fix this issue, the `setter` function should be modified to handle the base case where the recursion should stop. This can be achieved by introducing a condition to check if the vmin is less than vmax, and if not, swap the values before setting the attribute. Additionally, the `ignore` parameter should be removed as it's not used within the function.

Below is the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` method:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax):
        # docstring inherited.
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        getattr(self.axes, lim_name).__setattr__(attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

By incorporating the changes mentioned above, the potential stack overflow error should be resolved, and the `setter` function will work as intended for setting the interval values.
