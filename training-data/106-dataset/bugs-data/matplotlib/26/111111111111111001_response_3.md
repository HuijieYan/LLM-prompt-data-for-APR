This code defines a function `_make_getset_interval` that returns two methods, `getter` and `setter`. These methods are intended to get and set the interval limits for a given axis. However, there are issues with the current implementation.

The error message from the test function indicates that the returned interval `(0.7, 0.3)` does not match the expected interval `(1, 0)`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the implementation of the `getter` and `setter` functions.

The bug occurs within the `setter` function. The issue arises from mistakenly calling the `setter` and `getter` functions recursively instead of using the current `setter` and `getter` functions to set `vmin` and `vmax`. This results in the limits not being set correctly, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should use the provided `vmin` and `vmax` to set the limits directly. Additionally, the recursive calls to the `setter` and `getter` functions should be replaced with the current `setter` and `getter` functions to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
