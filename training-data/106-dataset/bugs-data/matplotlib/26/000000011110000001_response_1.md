The error occurs in the `_make_getset_interval` function within the `setter` method. The issue is that if `oldmin` is greater than `oldmax`, the current logic in the setter method will set the minimum and maximum values in reverse order. This causes the inversion of the axis ticks as observed in the `test_set_ticks_inverted` function.

To fix this issue, the logic within the `setter` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle cases where `oldmin` is greater than `oldmax`. Additionally, the calls to `getter` and `setter` within the `setter` method should reference the `getter` and `setter` methods that are being defined, rather than recursively calling itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    
    def getter(self):
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
``` 

With this correction, the `setter` method correctly sets the minimum and maximum values based on the condition of `oldmin` and `oldmax`, and the inversion issue should be resolved.
