The error message in the test function indicates that the `get_xlim` function is returning the wrong values, leading to an assertion error. 

The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the `setter` function. When the `setter` function is called with the `ignore` parameter set to `False`, it should compare the oldmin and oldmax values and then call itself. However, the bug is that it is calling itself recursively instead of calling the getter function.

This results in incorrect handling of the limits, leading to the incorrect values being returned by `get_xlim`.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should call the `getter` function instead of itself to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values. Then, it should perform the comparison and set the new values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_vmin = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_vmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmin, new_vmax))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected implementation, the `setter` function will correctly retrieve the oldmin and oldmax values and update the limits accordingly, fixing the bug.
