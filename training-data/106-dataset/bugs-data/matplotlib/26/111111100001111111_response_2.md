The issue seems to be related to the calculation of vmin and vmax in the setter function of the `_make_getset_interval` method. The condition for comparing oldmin and oldmax seems to be causing the bug, which may be resulting in the truncation of heatmaps.

To fix the bug, we should update the calculation of vmin and vmax in the setter function. Instead of comparing oldmin and oldmax directly, we should compare vmin and vmax with the current limits and update them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` method:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            current_lim = getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)
            new_vmin = min(vmin, vmax)
            new_vmax = max(vmin, vmax)

            if new_vmin < new_vmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmin, new_vmax))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmax, new_vmin))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = 'get_' + method_name + '_interval'
    setter.__name__ = 'set_' + method_name + '_interval'

    return getter, setter
```

With this fix, the calculation of vmin and vmax is updated to correctly handle the comparison and update of the limit values, which should resolve the issue related to the truncation of heatmaps.
