The issue in the provided function is that the `getter` function is being defined as a local function within the `_make_getset_interval` function, but then the `setter` function is trying to call the `getter` function as if it were a global function. This leads to a "NameError" when trying to call the `getter` function within the `setter` function.

To fix this, we can modify the `setter` function to use the local `getter` function without trying to call it globally. We can also remove the unnecessary recursion in the `setter` function. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            setattr(self.axes, lim_name, attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
