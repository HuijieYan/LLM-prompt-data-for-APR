Potential error location: The error seems to be originating from the `_make_getset_interval` function which is used to generate `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect use of `getter` and `setter` within the `setter` function. The recursion in the `setter` function is also problematic and is likely causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct `getter` and `setter` functions within the `setter` function.
2. Avoid recursion in the `setter` function to prevent potential infinite loops.
3. Ensure that the logic for setting the interval values is correct and does not lead to truncation of data.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
