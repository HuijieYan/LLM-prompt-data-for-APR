The issue seems to be related to the truncation of the top and bottom of the heatmaps when using seaborn with matplotlib version 3.1.1.

Upon analysis of the provided function, the potential error location seems to be in the `setter` method. The issue may be caused by the incorrect implementation of the logic for setting the minimum and maximum values for the interval. The recursive calls to `setter` within the `setter` method seem to be causing an infinite loop, leading to the truncation of the heatmaps.

To fix this bug, the recursive calls within the `setter` method should be removed. Instead, the logic for setting the minimum and maximum values for the interval should be adjusted to ensure that the correct values are assigned without causing an infinite loop.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
