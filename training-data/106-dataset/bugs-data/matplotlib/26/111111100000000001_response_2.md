The potential error in the provided code is that the nested getter and setter functions are being defined within the _make_getset_interval function, but they are not being returned or used outside of that function.

The bug occurs because the getter and setter functions are defined within the _make_getset_interval function but are not being returned or used outside of it. Instead, the getter and setter functions need to be returned by the _make_getset_interval function in order to be accessible and usable outside of it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _make_getset_interval function to return the getter and setter functions. We also need to remove the duplicate getter and setter functions defined at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_26/lib/matplotlib/axis.py

# corrected _make_getset_interval function
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                       ignore=True)
            else:
                setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                       ignore=True)
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
