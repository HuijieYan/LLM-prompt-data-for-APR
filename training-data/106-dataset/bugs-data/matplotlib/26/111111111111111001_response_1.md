The error occurs in the `setter` function of the `_make_getset_interval` method. This function is used to set the interval of the plot based on the minimum and maximum values provided. 

The bug occurs because the old minimum and maximum values are being retrieved using the `getter` function, but the recursive call to `setter` inside this function is incorrect. The `setter` function is called recursively within itself, which leads to an infinite loop and incorrect behavior when setting the intervals.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to `setter` should be replaced with a direct call to the `setter` method of the `Axes` object, passing the new `vmin` and `vmax` values and setting `ignore=True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` method:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                self.axes.set(*[(min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax))])
            else:
                self.axes.set(*[(max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin))])
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this correction, the recursive call to `setter` is replaced with a direct call to the `set` method of the `Axes` object, passing the appropriate `vmin` and `vmax` values. This should resolve the bug and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
