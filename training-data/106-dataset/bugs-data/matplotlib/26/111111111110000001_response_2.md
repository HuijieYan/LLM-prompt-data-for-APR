1. The test case checks if the x-axis limits of the plot are correctly inverted after setting the x-ticks. The error message indicates that the x-axis limits are not inverted as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `setter` method. The conditional statements in the `setter` method seem to be causing the incorrect inversion of the axis limits.

3. The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `setter` method is flawed. The function incorrectly tries to handle inversion of axis limits when "ignore" is set to False, resulting in the wrong order of axis limits.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to rewrite the conditional statements in the `setter` method to properly handle the inversion scenario and set the correct axis limits.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                getattr(self.axes, lim_name)._set(attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)))
            else:
                getattr(self.axes, lim_name)._set(attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax), min(vmin, vmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
``` 

The corrected code simplifies the conditional logic within the `setter` method and ensures that the axis limits are properly handled and the correct values are set based on the inversion scenario.
