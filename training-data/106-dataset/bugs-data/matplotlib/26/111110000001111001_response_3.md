The bug in the provided function is due to the recursive calls to the `setter` function. The intention seems to be to call the `setter` method defined within the surrounding function, but instead, it is making recursive calls to itself, leading to potential infinite recursion.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the recursive calls to `setter` and instead call the setter function defined in the enclosing scope.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                self.setter(min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), ignore=True)
            else:
                self.setter(max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This corrected code uses `self.setter()` for the recursive call, ensuring that the correct `setter` method is called without leading to potential infinite recursion.
