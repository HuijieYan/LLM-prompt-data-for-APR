Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `setter` function, where it calls itself recursively. This will result in an infinite recursive loop, causing the program to crash or freeze.

Reasons behind the bug: The `setter` function is calling itself recursively without any conditions to terminate the recursion. This is causing the program to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the recursive call in the `setter` function and instead use a loop or an iterative approach to achieve the same functionality.
2. Use a separate helper function or variable to handle the recursion termination condition and prevent infinite recursion.
3. Review the logic in the `setter` function and consider simplifying it to avoid the need for recursion.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                min_val = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                max_val = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                max_val = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                min_val = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min_val, max_val))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
