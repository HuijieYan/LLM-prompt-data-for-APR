1. The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` appears to be testing the behavior of setting ticks on the x-axis after it has been inverted. The test checks whether the x-axis limits are correctly inverted.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the new `min` and `max` values in the `setter` method. It appears that the calculations might be incorrect, leading to incorrect reversal of the limits.

3. The bug is likely occurring because the logic for handling the `ignore` parameter is not correctly implementing the inversion of the limits. This results in incorrect limits being set, causing the test case to fail.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for setting the `min` and `max` values should be revisited to ensure that they are correctly handling the inversion of the limits. Additionally, the use of the `ignore` parameter should be carefully reviewed to ensure it is being used appropriately to handle the inversion.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        axis_limits = getattr(self.axes, lim_name)
        if ignore:
            setattr(axis_limits, attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(axis_limits, attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `ignore` parameter is used appropriately, and the logic for setting the `min` and `max` values is revised to correctly handle the inversion of limits.
