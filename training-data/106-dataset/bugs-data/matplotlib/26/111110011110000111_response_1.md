1. The test function `test_set_ticks_inverted` is checking if the x-axis limits after setting ticks are correct. The error message indicates that the expected x-axis limits are (1, 0) but the actual result is (0.7, 0.3). This discrepancy suggests a bug in the `get_xlim()` function.

2. The potential error location is within the `getter` function returned by the `_make_getset_interval` method, specifically in the line `return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)`.

3. The bug occurred because the `getter` function is not correctly retrieving the x-axis limits when the axis is inverted. The `getter` function should consider the inverted state of the axis and return the limits accordingly. 

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `getter` function to correctly handle the case when the x-axis is inverted. This can be achieved by checking the inverted state of the axis and returning the limits accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # Check if the axis is inverted
        if getattr(self.axes, lim_name)._is_view_inverted():
            return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)[::-1]
        else:
            return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # The setter function remains unchanged

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `getter` function checks if the axis is inverted using `_is_view_inverted()` method and returns the limits accordingly. If the axis is inverted, it reverses the order of the limits before returning them.
