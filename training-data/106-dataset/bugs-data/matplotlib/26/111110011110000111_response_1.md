Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the incorrect behavior of the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `_make_getset_interval` method. These functions are used to get and set the data/view interval, but the implementation of the `setter` function seems to be incorrect.

Reasons for the bug: The bug stems from the incorrect recursive calls within the `setter` function, leading to incorrect adjustments of the minimum and maximum values. This results in the assertion error in the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `setter` function should be modified to correctly adjust the minimum and maximum values without using recursive calls. Additionally, the logic for comparing oldmin and oldmax is flawed and needs correction.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
            else:
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_max, new_min))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

The corrected `setter` function now correctly adjusts the minimum and maximum values and directly sets them using `setattr`. This should address the bug and resolve the assertion error in the test case.
