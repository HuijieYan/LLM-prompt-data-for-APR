The error occurs when the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` statement is executed in the `test_set_ticks_inverted` function. The expected value should be `(1, 0)` after the x-axis inversion, but the actual value returned is `(0.7, 0.3)`.

The bug occurs in the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the `setter` method. The logic for handling the inversion of the vmin and vmax values is incorrect, leading to the incorrect results when setting the x-axis ticks.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `setter` method needs to be revised. The correct approach is to swap the vmin and vmax values when the x-axis is inverted. The `if` condition needs to be updated to reflect this logic.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if self.get_xaxis().get_inverted():
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin  # Swap vmin and vmax if x-axis is inverted
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                   ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for the x-axis inversion using `self.get_xaxis().get_inverted()` and swapped the values of vmin and vmax when the x-axis is inverted. This modification will ensure that the expected behavior of the x-axis inversion is properly handled when setting the ticks, resolving the bug.
