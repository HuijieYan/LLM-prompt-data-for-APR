The error in the test case is due to the incorrect implementation of the getter and setter functions in the `_make_getset_interval` function. When the x-axis is inverted, the axis limits are also inverted and the set_xticks method does not handle this inversion properly, leading to the assertion error.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the getter and setter functions in the `_make_getset_interval` method is incorrect. The recursive calls to the setter function do not change the axis limits as intended, resulting in incorrect behavior when setting the ticks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the setter function to properly handle the inverted axis limits when setting the ticks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected code, the setter function now properly handles the inversion of axis limits and sets the ticks accordingly, fixing the bug in the test case.
