The bug occurs in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. This method is expected to return a boolean value based on the `_filled` attribute, but due to the buggy implementation in the `_recache` method, the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should set the `_filled` attribute to `True` when the fillstyle is not 'none'. This condition is currently missing from the `_recache` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed, and the test case for `is_filled()` method should pass successfully.
