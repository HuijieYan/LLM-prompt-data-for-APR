The error message from the test function indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_recache` function, which initializes the properties of the `MarkerStyle` object, is not setting the `_filled` property correctly.

The potential error in the `_recache` function is the line `self._filled = True`, which should actually be `self._filled = False` to correctly represent the initial state of the `MarkerStyle` object.

The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is incorrectly setting the `_filled` property to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value passed when initializing the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to check the `fillstyle` and set the `_filled` property accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function now correctly updates the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle`, which resolves the bug.
