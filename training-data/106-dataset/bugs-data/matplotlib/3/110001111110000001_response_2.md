1. The test case is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which has a dependency on the `_recache` method in the `markers.py` file.

2. The potential error location is the `self._marker_function()` line in the `_recache` method.

3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning a bound method rather than a boolean value. This suggests that the `_recache` method is not properly setting up the `MarkerStyle` object, causing the `is_filled` method to return an unexpected result.

4. To fix this bug, the `_recache` method needs to properly initialize the `MarkerStyle` object and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns a boolean value.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
```
