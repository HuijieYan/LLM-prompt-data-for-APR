Potential error location: The line `self._filled = True` is setting the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the input value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is caused by the incorrect unconditional assignment of the `_filled` variable to `True` within the `_recache` function. This prevents the function from correctly updating the `_filled` value based on the input parameters.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `_filled` variable should be assigned based on the value of `self._fillstyle` input parameter in the input method.

Corrected code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
