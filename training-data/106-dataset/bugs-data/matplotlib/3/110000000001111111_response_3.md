The bug is likely occurring in the _recache method of the MarkerStyle class. The method should set the _filled attribute to False if the _fillstyle attribute is set to 'none', but it is currently not doing so.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the _fillstyle is 'none' and set the _filled attribute accordingly.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
