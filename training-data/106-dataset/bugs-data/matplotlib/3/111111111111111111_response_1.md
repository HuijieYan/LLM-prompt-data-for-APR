The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method returns `True` instead of the expected `False` after setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` method. This assignment sets the filled property to `True`, which conflicts with the expected behavior when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The bug occurred because setting the fillstyle to 'none' should result in the marker being hollow, which means it should not be filled.

To fix the bug, the assignment `self._filled = True` should be replaced with `self._filled = False` when the fillstyle is 'none', and set to `True` otherwise.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the MarkerStyle will honor the expected behavior for the `fillstyle` parameter.
