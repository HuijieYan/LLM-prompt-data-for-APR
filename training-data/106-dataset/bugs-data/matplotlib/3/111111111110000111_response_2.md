The error message in the test function is related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is used to check if the marker is filled. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning True, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error location within the `MarkerStyle` class is the `_recache` method. This method is called to reset the marker properties, but it also calls the `_marker_function` method without any condition. This might be causing unintended side effects in the marker properties.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_recache` method is not handling all the properties of the marker correctly, and it's also calling the `_marker_function` without checking if it's necessary.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the `_recache` method to handle all the marker properties and remove the unconditional call to the `_marker_function`. The corrected code for the `_recache` method is provided below:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method will execute the `_marker_function` only if it's not None, and it will properly reset all the marker properties.

This should fix the issue where markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'. The corrected code will ensure that the marker properties are handled correctly and the marker is rendered as expected.
