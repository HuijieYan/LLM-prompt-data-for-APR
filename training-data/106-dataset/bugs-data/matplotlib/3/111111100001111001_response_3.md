The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to True unconditionally at the end of the function, irrespective of the input value of `self._fillstyle`. This contradicts the expected behavior based on the input parameter value and type for the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for setting the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Adjusted condition
    self._marker_function()
```

By using the condition `(self._fillstyle != 'none')`, we make sure that `_filled` is set to `True` only when `self._fillstyle` is not equal to 'none', which is consistent with the expected behavior based on the input parameters.

This change will ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the input value of `self._fillstyle`, resolving the bug in the function.
