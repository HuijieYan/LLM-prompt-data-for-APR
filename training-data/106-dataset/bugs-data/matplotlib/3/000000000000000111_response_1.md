Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the marker properties when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` and setting the `fillstyle` to 'none'.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely caused by the `_recache` method not properly updating the marker properties when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

Approach to fix the bug: We need to ensure that the `_recache` method properly updates the marker properties, including the fillstyle.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False to make markers hollow
    self._marker_function()
```
