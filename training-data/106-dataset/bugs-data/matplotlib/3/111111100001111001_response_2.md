The buggy function `_recache` does not have any checks or assignments related to the `self._fillstyle` variable, which is a potential cause of the bug when the `_marker_function` is called. It seems that the function should take into consideration the `self._fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check for `self._fillstyle` and update `self._filled` based on its value.

Here's the corrected function with the added conditional check:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
