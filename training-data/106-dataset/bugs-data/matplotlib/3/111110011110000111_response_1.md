The issue seems to be related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not.

The issue appears to be in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `is_filled` method is likely checking the value that is being set incorrectly in this method.

Upon reviewing the `_recache` method, it's evident that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This could be where the bug is originating. To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set filled status based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the issue should be resolved, and the custom marker style should behave as expected when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'` option.
