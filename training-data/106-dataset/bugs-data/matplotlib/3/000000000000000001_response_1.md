Potential error location: The `self._marker_function()` is called without first checking if it exists, which could result in a `NoneType` error.

Reason behind the bug: The function does not check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, which could lead to an error if it is not defined or if it is `None`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
