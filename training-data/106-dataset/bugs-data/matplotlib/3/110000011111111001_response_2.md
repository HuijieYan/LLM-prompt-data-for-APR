The error arises from a discrepancy in the expected behavior of the MarkerStyle object's `is_filled` method and its actual behavior. The `is_filled` method should return `True` if the marker is meant to be filled, but it's returning `False`. This discrepancy indicates that the `_recache` method, specifically the code that handles the `_filled` attribute, may not be setting it to the expected value.

The `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the buggy function, which contradicts the expected behavior in the test case where it should be `True`.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `True` instead of `False` within the `_recache` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Change from False to True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the MarkerStyle object will correctly identify that the marker is filled, as expected in the test case.
