Potential error location: The potential error is in the `_set_label()` method, which is not defined in the given function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the `_set_label()` method is not defined within the given function. This method is called within the function, but it does not exist, causing a runtime error.

Approach for fixing the bug: Define the `_set_label()` method within the class or modify the function to directly set the label and labelkw attributes without calling an undefined method.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
```
