The bug occurs in the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. When `label` is `None`, the `set_label` method sets `self._label` to the string representation of `None` instead of using `None` as the value for `self._label`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when `label` is `None` and not convert it to a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the updated function after fixing the bug
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = label if label is not None else ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
