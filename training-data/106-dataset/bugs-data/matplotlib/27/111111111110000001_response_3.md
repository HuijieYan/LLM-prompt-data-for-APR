The error occurs in the `test_colorbar_label` function, specifically in the assertion `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''`. This is where the AssertionError is raised because the actual output is 'None' rather than an empty string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_label` method. It seems that when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, it is not handling the input correctly and is setting the label to the string 'None' instead of an actual empty label.

The bug is occurring because the `set_label` method is not handling the `None` input as expected. When `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, it sets the label to the string representation of `None` (i.e., 'None') instead of an actual empty label.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `set_label` method to handle the `None` input explicitly and set the label to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label) if label is not None else ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, the `set_label` method will handle the `None` input correctly and set the label to an empty string, resolving the bug.
