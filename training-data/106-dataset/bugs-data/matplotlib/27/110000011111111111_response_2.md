The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with a `None` value for the label. In this case, the assertion `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` fails because the `get_ylabel` method returns the string `'None'` instead of an empty string.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method is not handling the case when the label value is `None` properly. Instead of setting the label to an empty string, it sets it to the string `'None'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label is `None` and set the `_label` attribute to an empty string in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
