The test case is trying to verify that the label parameter is being used correctly to set the label for the colorbar. The issue arises when trying to set the label to None and then verify that it is an empty string.

The potential error location is within the set_label function of the ColorbarBase class. The issue seems to be that setting the label to None does not correctly result in an empty string for the label.

The bug occurs because when the label is set to None, it is not handled properly and instead remains as the string 'None'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the set_label function to handle None as a special case and set the label to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:  # handling None as a special case
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
