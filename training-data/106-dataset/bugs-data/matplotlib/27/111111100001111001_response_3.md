The code is failing to call the method `_set_label` inside the `set_label` method. This is a bug because it creates an inconsistency where `_set_label` is defined with a different structure than `set_label`. 

To fix this issue, we can call `_set_label` method using the `self` keyword inside the `set_label` method. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
