The bug occurs when the set_label function is called with None as the label, as in the test function. The function fails to handle the case where the label is None and still sets the label as 'None' instead of an empty string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the set_label function to handle the case where the label is None and set the label to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this fix, when the label is set to None, it will be handled to set the label as an empty string instead of 'None'. This will ensure that the label is not displayed when it's set to None.
