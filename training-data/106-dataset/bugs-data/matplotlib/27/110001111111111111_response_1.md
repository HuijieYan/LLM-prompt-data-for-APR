The error message from the test function is asserting that the result of `cbar.ax.get_ylabel()` should be an empty string, but it actually returns the string 'None'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_label` method. When `label` is set to `None`, it sets `self._label` to the string representation of `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the `label` parameter is `None` appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the `None` case and set `self._label` to `None` if `label` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
