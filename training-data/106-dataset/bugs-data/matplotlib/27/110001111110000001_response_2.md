The error message is complaining that 'None' is not equal to ''. This indicates that the `cbar.set_label(None)` call is not properly clearing the label.

The issue lies in the `set_label` function. When `None` is passed as the label, the function is not clearing the label properly, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check in the `set_label` function to handle the case when `None` is passed as the label. In this case, we should set the `_label` attribute to an empty string to clear the label.

Here's the corrected `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ""
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this fix, the `set_label` function will properly handle the case when `None` is passed as the label, and the label will be cleared as expected.
