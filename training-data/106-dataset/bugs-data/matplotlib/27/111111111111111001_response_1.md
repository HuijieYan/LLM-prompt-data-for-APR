This function appears to be correctly implemented as per the requirements specified in the test cases. The issue lies in the condition `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` which fails because the `set_label` method is not correctly setting the label to `None` as expected in the test case.

To fix this issue, the `set_label` method should handle the case where the `label` parameter is None differently. Instead of setting the label to the string `'None'`, we should simply not set a label.

Here's the corrected `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this corrected method, the `set_label` function will correctly handle the case where the `label` parameter is `None`, and the test case will pass without errors.
