The error message comes from the line `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''`, which fails because the `get_ylabel()` method returns the string 'None' instead of an empty string, as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_label` method. It seems that when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, it does not properly handle the `None` input and sets the label as the string 'None' instead of an empty string.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not check if the input is `None` and simply sets the label as the string representation of the input. This causes the label to be set as 'None' instead of an empty string.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `set_label` method to handle the `None` input and set the label as an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
