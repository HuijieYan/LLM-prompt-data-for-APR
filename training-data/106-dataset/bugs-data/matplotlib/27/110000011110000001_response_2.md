The error message is indicating an assertion failure when checking for an empty string after setting the label to None. This suggests that the set_label function is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the set_label function is the line `_set_label()` which is a private method and not defined within the given code. This may be causing the function to fail when setting the label to None.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of setting the label to None properly. It is also not able to map the label parameter to the xlabel/ylabel of the axes correctly depending on the orientation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the set_label function to handle the case when the label is set to None and also properly map the label to the xlabel/ylabel of the axes based on the orientation.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    if self.orientation == 'vertical':
        self.ax.set_ylabel(self._label, **kw)
    else:
        self.ax.set_xlabel(self._label, **kw)
```

This corrected code checks if the label is not None, and if so, it converts it to a string. If it is None, it sets the label to an empty string. Then, depending on the orientation, it sets the ylabel or xlabel of the axes accordingly using the set_ylabel or set_xlabel methods.
