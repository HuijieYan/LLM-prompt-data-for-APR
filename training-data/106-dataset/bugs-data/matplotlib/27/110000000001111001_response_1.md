The potential error in the given function is that it doesn't contain the implementation for the `_set_label()` method, which is likely supposed to set the label of the colorbar.

The bug occurs because the `_set_label()` method is being called but it is not implemented within the given function. As a result, the function will throw an error when it tries to call `_set_label()`.

To fix this bug, we need to implement the `_set_label()` method to actually set the label of the colorbar. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()  # This line throws an error if `_set_label()` method is not implemented

def _set_label(self):
    # Implementation for setting the label of the colorbar
    pass  # Placeholder, you need to implement the actual code for setting the label
```

In this corrected code, the `_set_label()` method is added with a placeholder `pass` statement, representing the actual implementation for setting the label of the colorbar. This way, when `set_label()` is called, it will no longer throw an error related to `_set_label()` method.
