The issue with the given function is that it's not properly handling the edge case when the label is set to None. This causes the label to remain as the previous value even when a new label is provided.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_set_label` method to handle the case when the label is None and set the `self._label` attribute accordingly. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

This modification checks if the label provided is not None before updating the `_label` attribute. If the label is None, it will preserve the previous value, otherwise, it will update it with the new label.
