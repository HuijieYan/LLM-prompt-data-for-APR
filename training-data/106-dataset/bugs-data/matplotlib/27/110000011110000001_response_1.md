1. The test_colorbar_label() function is testing the set_label() method of the colorbar object. It checks if the label on the colorbar is correctly set and removed.

2. The potential error location is identified within the set_label() method. The method is supposed to set the label of the colorbar, but it seems to be misbehaving.

3. The error message indicates that the label is not being cleared when set_label(None) is called. This suggests that the set_label() method is not handling the None input properly.

4. To fix the bug, the set_label() method should be modified to handle the case of None input and clear the label in that case. Additionally, the method should set the label based on the orientation of the colorbar (horizontal or vertical).

5. Here's the corrected set_label() method:
```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self.ax.set_label(str(label))
    else:
        if self.orientation == 'vertical':
            self.ax.set_ylabel('')
        elif self.orientation == 'horizontal':
            self.ax.set_xlabel('')
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
This modification checks if the label is not None and sets it using the appropriate axis (ylabel for vertical orientation and xlabel for horizontal orientation). If the label is None, it clears the label based on the orientation.
