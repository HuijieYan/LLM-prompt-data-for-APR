The issue seems to be related to the handling of the label argument in the set_label function. When the label argument is set to None, the function still processes it as a string "None" instead of treating it as a null value.

To fix this issue, we can modify the set_label function to check if the label argument is None, and if so, set self._label to an empty string instead of converting None to a string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ""
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, the set_label function will handle the label argument correctly, and the issue of the label appearing as "None" when label=None should be resolved.
