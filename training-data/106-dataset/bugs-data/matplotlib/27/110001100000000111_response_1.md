The issue is with the `set_label` method of the colorbar in the `colorbar.py` file of the matplotlib library. When `label=None` is passed to the `set_label` method, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of not appearing at all.

The potential error location is in the `set_label` method where the label is assigned directly to `self._label` without checking if it is None.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the label is None. As a result, it sets the `_label` attribute to the string representation of None, which is "None".

To fix the bug, we can modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label is None and not assign anything to the `_label` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
