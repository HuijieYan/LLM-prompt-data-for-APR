The error seems to be occurring when the `cbar.set_label(None)` line is executed. This is because when `None` is passed as the label argument, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of not appearing at all.

The potential error location is within the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. When `None` is passed as the label, it should not set the label at all, but the current implementation sets the label to the string representation of `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_label` method does not handle the case when `None` is passed as the label argument.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `set_label` method to check if the label is `None`. If it is `None`, then the label should not be set.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
```

With this modification, the label will only be set if it is not `None`. This should fix the issue where the label appears as "None" when `None` is given as the label.

After making this change, the `test_colorbar_label` test function should no longer result in an assertion error.
