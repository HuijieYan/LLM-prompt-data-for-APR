The issue is that when the `label` argument is set to `None` in the `set_label` method, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of not appearing at all.

The potential error location within the code is the `set_label` method, where the label is assigned to `self._label` without checking if it is `None` or not.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the `label` argument is set to `None`. It simply assigns the string representation of `label` to `self._label`.

To fix the bug, we can check if the `label` argument is `None` before assigning it to `self._label`.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
        """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
        if label is not None:
            self._label = str(label)
        else:
            self._label = None
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `label` is not `None` before assigning it to `self._label`. If it is `None`, we assign `None` to `self._label` instead. This way, the label will not appear when the `label` argument is set to `None`.
