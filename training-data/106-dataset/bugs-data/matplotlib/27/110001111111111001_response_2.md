The error message is indicating that the `cbar.ax.get_ylabel()` is returning the string 'None' instead of an empty string, leading to the assertion error when comparing it to an empty string.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the `set_label` method.

The bug is occurring because the `set_label` method is not updating the label value correctly. When a `None` label is passed, it should set the label to an empty string, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to check if the label parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, we should update the `_label` variable to an empty string instead of using `str(label)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''  # Update the _label to empty string
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this change, the `set_label` method will correctly handle the case when the `label` parameter is `None`, ensuring that `_label` is updated to an empty string. This will fix the bug and make the test case pass.
