The error occurs due to the implementation of the `set_label` method in the `ColorbarBase` class. When `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the assertion `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` fails because `cbar.ax.get_ylabel()` returns the string "None" instead of an empty string.

The issue arises because in the `set_label` method, the `_set_label` function is called regardless of whether the `label` is None. This causes the label to be set to the string representation of None.

To fix this issue, the `set_label` method should be modified to handle the case when the `label` is None. In such cases, the label should be set to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By making this change, when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the assertion `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` will pass as expected.
