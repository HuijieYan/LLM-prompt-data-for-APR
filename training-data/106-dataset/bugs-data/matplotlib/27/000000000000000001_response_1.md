The potential error in the provided function is the way the keyword arguments (**kw) are being handled. The function is attempting to assign all the keyword arguments to a single variable (_labelkw) which won't work as expected.

To fix this issue, we can use the **kwargs syntax to collect all the keyword arguments into a dictionary inside the function. Then we can handle the dictionary as needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kwargs):
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kwargs
    self._set_label()
```

In this corrected code, we use **kwargs to collect all keyword arguments into a dictionary named 'kwargs'. Then we assign this dictionary to the _labelkw variable for further processing.
