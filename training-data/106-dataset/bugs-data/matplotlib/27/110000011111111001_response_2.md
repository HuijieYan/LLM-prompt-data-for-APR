The error occurs when the `assert cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` line is executed. This is because the `set_label` method is not correctly handling the case when the label is set to `None`.

The potential error location within the `set_label` method is in the line `self._label = str(label)`. When `label` is `None`, it is being converted to the string 'None' and being set as the value of `self._label`.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the `label` parameter is set to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the `label` parameter is `None`, and handle it appropriately. We can modify the function to set `self._label` to `None` when the `label` parameter is `None`.

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when `label` is `None`, `self._label` will be set to `None`, and the subsequent method calls should handle this case correctly.
