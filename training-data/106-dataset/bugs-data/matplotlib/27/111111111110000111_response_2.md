The issue seems to be with the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. When the `set_label` method is called with `label=None`, it is not removing the label as expected, but instead, it is setting the label to the string `'None'`.

The potential error is likely in the `set_label` method, specifically in the line `self._label = str(label)`. This line is causing the label to be set to the string representation of `None`, i.e., `'None'`, when `label` is passed as `None`.

The issue occurs because the `str` function is converting the value `None` to the string `'None'`. We need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the `label` is `None` and to remove the label in that case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `label` is `None` and, if so, set the label to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this change, when the `set_label` method is called with `label=None`, the label will be set to an empty string, and the issue should be resolved.
