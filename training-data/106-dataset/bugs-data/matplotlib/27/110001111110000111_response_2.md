The error occurs when the `cbar.set_label(None)` is called in the test function. This should set the label to an empty string, but it's currently not working as expected.

The potential error location is within the `set_label` function of the Colorbar class. The line `self._label = str(label)` sets the label to the string representation of the label, even if it's None. This causes the label to be set to "None" when None is passed as the label.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the label is None and set it to an empty string if it is.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

This change ensures that if the label is None, it will be set to an empty string, preventing "None" from being displayed as the label.
