The issue here is that the `set_label` function is incorrectly setting the `_label` attribute to the string form of the provided label, even if the label is None. This results in the label being displayed as "None" instead of being hidden when label=None.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `set_label` function to check if the label is None, and if so, set the `_label` attribute to an empty string. This will ensure that the label is hidden when label=None.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when label=None is passed to the `set_label` function, the label will be hidden, as expected.
