The bug occurs when the `set_label` method is called with a `None` value for the `label` parameter. This causes the label to be set as the string 'None' instead of removing the label.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the `label` parameter is `None`. In this case, the label should be removed instead of being set to the string 'None'.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:  # Check if label is not None
        self._label = str(label) 
    else:
        self._label = None  # If label is None, set it to None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this fix, when the `label` parameter is `None`, the label will be removed instead of being set to the string 'None'. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the bug report and the associated test case.
