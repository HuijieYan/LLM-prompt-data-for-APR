The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `set_label` method of the `Colorbar` class. Specifically, when setting the label to `None`, the returned value is `'None'` instead of an empty string.

The potential error location within the `set_label` method is the line `self._label = str(label)`. This line assigns the label to `self._label` without considering the case when the label is `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the label is `None` appropriately. As a result, the assertion fails when comparing the label to an empty string in the test case.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the case when the label is `None` within the `set_label` method. If the label is `None`, `self._label` should be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By adding a conditional check for `label is None` and setting `self._label` to an empty string in that case, the bug can be fixed.
