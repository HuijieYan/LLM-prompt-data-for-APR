The error in the code is caused by the incorrect method name. The function that needs to be called is `_set_label` instead of `set_label`. This has led to the code being unable to set the label and causing inconsistencies in the variable `_label`.

To fix this error, the `set_label` method should be modified to correctly call the `_set_label` method. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_27/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _set_label(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
