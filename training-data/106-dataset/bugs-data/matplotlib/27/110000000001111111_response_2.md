The bug occurs because the function `set_label` does not handle the case when the label is set to None. When the label is set to None, the code still converts it to a string and assigns it to `self._label`, resulting in the "None" string appearing as the label.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the label is None before assigning it to `self._label`. If the label is None, we should set `self._label` to an empty string instead.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ""
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
