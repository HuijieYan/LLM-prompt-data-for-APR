The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with a `None` value. This results in the label being set to the string "None" instead of removing the label as expected.

The potential error location is within the `set_label` method, where the label is directly assigned to `self._label` without considering the case when it is `None`.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the label parameter is `None`. The method should check if the label is `None` and handle it accordingly, for example, by clearing the label.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to properly handle the case when the label is `None`. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:  # Check if the label is not None
        self._label = str(label)
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
    else:
        self._label = None  # If label is None, clear the label
```

By adding the check for `label is not None`, we can prevent assigning the string "None" to the label when the input is actually `None`.

With this modification, the `set_label` method will correctly handle the case when the label is `None`.

Please replace the original `set_label` method with the corrected one above in the source code.
