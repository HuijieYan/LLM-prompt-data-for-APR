The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with the argument `None`, but the label still appears as "None" instead of it being empty.

The potential error can be found in the `set_label` method within the `ColorbarBase` class. It incorrectly sets the label as "None" instead of an empty string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `set_label` method is called with the argument `None`, it is not handled correctly inside the method.

To fix the bug, the `set_label` method should be modified to handle the case where the label is `None`, and set it to an empty string instead.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, when the `set_label` method is called with `None`, it sets the `_label` attribute to an empty string. This will ensure that the label does not appear as "None" when `None` is passed as the argument.
