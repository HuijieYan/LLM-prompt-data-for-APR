The issue seems to be occurring because the function `_set_label` is not defined in the class `ColorbarBase`. When the `set_label` method is called, it tries to call `_set_label`, which results in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `_set_label` function needs to be added to the `ColorbarBase` class.

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()

def _set_label(self):
    # define the behavior of setting the label here
    pass
```
