The bug seems to be occurring in the set_label function, where the label kwarg is not handled correctly when it is set to None.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
self._label = str(label)
```
Here, the label is being converted to a string without checking if it is None.

The bug occurs because when label=None is passed as an argument, it is being converted to the string "None" and set as the label, instead of not showing any label.

To fix this bug, we can add a conditional statement to check if the label is None, and if so, not set the label at all.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when label=None is passed, the label will not be set at all, instead of showing the text "None".
