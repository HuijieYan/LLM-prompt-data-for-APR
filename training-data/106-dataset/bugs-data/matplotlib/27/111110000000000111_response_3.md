Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `set_label` method of the ColorbarBase class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `set_label` method does not handle the case where the `label` argument is None properly. Instead of checking if the label is None and handling it accordingly, it simply converts the label to a string and sets it as the `_label` attribute.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The `set_label` method should be modified to handle the case where the `label` argument is None. It should check if the label is None and only set the `_label` attribute if it is not None.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected set_label function
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
