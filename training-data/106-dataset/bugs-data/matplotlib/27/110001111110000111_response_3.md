The bug is occurring in the `set_label` function. When the `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the label should actually be removed, but it is not due to a bug in the current implementation.

The reason behind the bug is that the `set_label` function is not handling the case when the label is set to None. Instead of removing the label, it is setting the label to the string "None".

To fix this bug, the `set_label` function should be modified to handle the case when the label is set to None. It should check if the label is None, and if so, it should remove the label instead of setting it to the string "None".

Here is the corrected code for the `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the label will be removed instead of being set to the string "None". This will resolve the bug reported in the issue.
