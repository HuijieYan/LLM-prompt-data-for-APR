The error in the `set_label` method is that it calls the `_set_label` method without passing any arguments, but the `_set_label` method expects at least one argument. This is evident because the `_set_label` definition includes `self` as a parameter and the `_set_label` method is called without any arguments.

To fix this bug, the `_set_label` method should be called with the label and kw arguments passed to the `set_label` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label(label, **kw)
```
