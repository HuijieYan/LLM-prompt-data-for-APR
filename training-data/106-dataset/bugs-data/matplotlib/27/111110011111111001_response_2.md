The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with a `None` value, causing the assertion to fail. The bug is likely in the `set_label` method, where it does not handle `None` values correctly.

The potential error location is in the `set_label` method where `self._label` is set to the `str(label)`, which will result in `'None'` when a `None` value is passed.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle `None` values properly. It should handle `None` as a special case and not set `self._label` to a string value.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `set_label` method to handle `None` values as a special case. When `None` is passed, it should set `self._label` to `None` instead of converting it to a string.

The corrected code for the `set_label` method is as follows:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By handling the `None` value as a special case, the `set_label` method will now correctly handle `None` values and set `self._label` accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass without any assertion errors.
