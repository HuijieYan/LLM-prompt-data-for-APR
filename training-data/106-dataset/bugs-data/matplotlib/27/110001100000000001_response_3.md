The error in the provided function is that the function `_set_label` is not defined within the class. Therefore, calling `_set_label()` within the `set_label` function will result in an error.

To fix this, we need to define the `_set_label` function within the class and call it using `self._set_label()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_27/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _set_label(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class Colorbar:
    # other methods and properties

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def set_label(self, label, **kw):
        """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
        self._label = str(label)
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
```

By defining the `_set_label` function within the class, we ensure that it is accessible to the `set_label` function and can be called using `self._set_label()` without any errors.
