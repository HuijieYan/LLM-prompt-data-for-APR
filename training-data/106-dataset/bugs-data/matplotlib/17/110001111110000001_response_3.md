The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute".
These warnings suggest that there may be an issue with handling large numbers in the function.

Upon analyzing the problematic function, it appears that the issue may arise from how the function is handling large values and the comparison of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle large values and the comparison of the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints, leading to the overflow warnings.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Use conditionals to check for large values and handle them appropriately.
2. Utilize a different approach for comparing the interval to the maximum absolute value of its endpoints in order to prevent overflow during calculations.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin) * np.sign(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax) * np.sign(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, large values are handled by using np.sign() to get the sign of the number and then perform the calculations accordingly. This should address the overflow warnings and ensure that the function properly handles large values during calculations.
