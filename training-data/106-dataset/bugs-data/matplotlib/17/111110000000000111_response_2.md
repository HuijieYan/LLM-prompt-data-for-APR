Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the calculation of the expanded endpoints (vmin and vmax) when the interval is too small.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of the interval size and the expansion of vmin and vmax when the interval is too small.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the interval is expanded proportionally to the size of the interval and not just based on expander and tiny values.
2. Check for special cases such as when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
3. Consider the cases when inputs are inf or NaN.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0) or (abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- We first handle the special cases where inputs are inf or NaN, or when both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.
- We then consider the increasing flag to swap vmin and vmax if necessary.
- The calculation of the expanded endpoints is now based on the interval size and the maxabsvalue.
