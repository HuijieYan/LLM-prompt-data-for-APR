The error messages indicate that there are potential issues with overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations. This suggests that the bug might be related to the calculation of the absolute or the subtraction of the scalar values.

The potential error location in the function is the calculation of `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This calculation is used for determining `maxabsvalue`.

The reason behind the bug is that the absolute value calculation might result in overflow, and the subtraction operation might also result in overflow when dealing with large integer values.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to handle the overflow scenarios when calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. Another approach could be to use a different method for comparing and calculating the absolute values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin) if vmin >= 0 else -vmin
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax) if vmax >= 0 else -vmax
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are calculated separately, handling potential overflow scenarios. Then, the max absolute value is calculated using `abs_vmin` and `abs_vmax`. This approach should resolve the overflow issues encountered in the original function.
