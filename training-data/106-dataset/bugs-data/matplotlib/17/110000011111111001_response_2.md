The error occurs in the `nonsingular` function, specifically in the `maxabsvalue` calculation where it tries to calculate the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`. The error is triggered by overflow encountered in the scalar absolute calculation.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the absolute value calculation using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` can result in overflow when dealing with very large numbers, such as `-32768` which is the minimum value for `int16`.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to handle the overflow condition by utilizing a try-except block for any potential overflow. If an overflow occurs, catch the exception and fall back to an alternative method for finding the maximum absolute value.

The corrected code for the `nonsingular` function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    ... (same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    try:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    except OverflowError:
        # Handle overflow by using alternative method for maximum absolute value
        maxabsvalue = abs(vmin) if abs(vmin) > abs(vmax) else abs(vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code includes a try-except block to handle potential OverflowError when calculating the maximum absolute value. If an overflow occurs, the code falls back to an alternative method for finding the maximum absolute value, ensuring that the function can handle large number inputs without triggering an overflow error.
