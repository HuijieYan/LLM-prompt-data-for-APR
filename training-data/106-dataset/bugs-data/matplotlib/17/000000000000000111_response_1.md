Potential error location: 
The potential error is occurring in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. This calculation should take into account the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, but the current implementation does not do that.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `maxabsvalue` is being calculated incorrectly, which results in incorrect adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` when they are small.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Calculate `maxabsvalue` using the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
2. Adjust the calculations of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the correct `maxabsvalue` to ensure they are expanded appropriately when small.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Calculate maxabsvalue using absolute values of vmin and vmax
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
