The bug occurs when the `nonsingular` function attempts to fix the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid singularities. The bug could be related to the incorrect handling of values and types for the input parameters and internal variables.

In the function, there are multiple conditional checks and modifications made to `vmin` and `vmax` based on specific conditions. Some of the conditions involve comparing the values against thresholds and limits, and the logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` is also included. However, the incorrect handling of comparisons and conditional checks could lead to unexpected modifications or incorrect values for `vmin` and `vmax`.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the conditional checks and modifications are accurately performed based on the input parameter values and types. Additionally, the swapping logic should be validated to guarantee the correct ordering of the endpoints.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code ensures that the conditional checks, modifications, and the swapping logic are properly implemented to address the buggy behavior.
