Based on the error messages provided, the issue seems to be related to overflow encountered in scalar subtract and scalar absolute operations within the `nonsingular` function from the `matplotlib.transforms` module.

The root cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of large integer values (e.g., int16) when performing operations that expect float values, such as subtraction and absolute value calculations.

To fix this bug, the function should ensure that the input values are properly cast to float before performing arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by explicitly converting `vmin` and `vmax` to float using `np.float64` or `float` to guarantee that all arithmetic operations are done using floating-point numbers. Additionally, checks for finiteness should be adjusted to handle integer inputs correctly.

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Ensure vmin and vmax are of type float
    vmin = np.float64(vmin)
    vmax = np.float64(vmax)

    # Check for inf and NaN values
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander
    
    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    # Calculate max absolute value
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Handle small interval and adjust endpoints
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    
    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary and return
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly converting `vmin` and `vmax` to float using `np.float64`, we ensure that arithmetic operations are performed using floating-point numbers, preventing overflow issues with large integer inputs. Additionally, the checks for finiteness are adjusted to handle integer inputs correctly.
