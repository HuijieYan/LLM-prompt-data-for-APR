The error messages indicate that there are overflow issues and runtime warnings related to scalar operations and absolute values. This is likely due to the use of non-ideal data types for the variables or a poor choice of comparison conditions. 

To fix the issue, it's necessary to address the potential cast overflow issues by narrowing the variable types. The maxabsvalue should be calculated using floating-point math instead of integer operations. The condition for checking if the interval is close to zero or too small should be adjusted based on absolute values, not direct values. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Change variable types to float.
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)
    
    # Check for inf or NaN.
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Use floating-point math for the comparison instead of integer operations.
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Change the comparison to use absolute values.
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function addresses the potential overflow issues and comparison conditions that were causing the bugs.
