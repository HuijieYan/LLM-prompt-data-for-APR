Potential error location: The `nonsingular` function contains several conditional statements that manipulate the `vmin` and `vmax` values based on certain conditions. The logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on the increasing boolean and the condition for expanding the interval might be causing the bug.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug might occur due to incorrect handling of the conditions for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` and for expanding the interval. In addition, the use of np.finfo(float).tiny for comparisons might not be appropriate.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Utilize a different approach for handling the comparison and expansion of intervals to avoid the reliance on np.finfo(float).tiny.
2. Review the conditional statements to ensure that the swapping logic and interval expansion logic are correctly implemented and do not conflict with each other in certain scenarios.

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        if vmin < vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
``` 

The corrected nonsingular function separates the swapping logic based on the increasing boolean using if-else conditions. Additionally, it removes the use of np.finfo(float).tiny and simplifies the condition for interval expansion.
