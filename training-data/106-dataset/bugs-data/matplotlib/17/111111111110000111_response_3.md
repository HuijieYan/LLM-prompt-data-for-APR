The problematic function `nonsingular` takes two endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` and modifies them as needed to avoid singularities. The error message indicates that an overflow is encountered in the function.

Upon analyzing the code and the test function, it seems that the issue arises when calculating the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` using the `maxabsvalue` variable. This can lead to an overflow, especially when dealing with large input values.

The potential reasons behind the occurrence of the overflow bug are:
1. Using the `max` function without handling potential overflow cases.
2. Calculating the maximum absolute value using the `max` function may lead to an overflow if the input values are very large.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to revise the method of calculating the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid potential overflow. This can be achieved by utilizing conditional statements to handle the overflow case.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    if abs_vmin > abs_vmax:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmin
    else:
        maxabsvalue = abs_vmax

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
1. The absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are calculated separately to prevent any potential overflow when using the `max` function.
2. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
3. Based on the absolute values, the variable `maxabsvalue` is assigned accordingly to avoid potential overflow.
