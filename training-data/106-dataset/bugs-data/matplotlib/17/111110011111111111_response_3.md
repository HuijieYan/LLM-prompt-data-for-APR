The error messages indicate an overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute, suggesting that the calculations in the `nonsingular` function are resulting in overflow due to large input values.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the calculations involving `maxabsvalue` and the comparison of `(vmax - vmin)` against `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are the use of large input values, which leads to overflow issues during the calculations.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use safe arithmetic operations to handle large input values and prevent overflow issues. This can include using conditional statements to check for overflow before performing operations, as well as using explicit type conversions to ensure that intermediate values do not exceed the allowed range for the datatype.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        if abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
            range_width = vmax - vmin
            vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin / range_width)
            vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax / range_width)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
