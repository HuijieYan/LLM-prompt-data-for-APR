The potential error in the `nonsingular` function lies in the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. If this condition is True, the function should modify the values of `vmin` and `vmax` to avoid singularities. However, the current implementation of the condition and the subsequent modifications are not achieving this goal.

The bug occurs because the condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` does not adequately capture all cases where singularities may occur. It only considers the relative difference between `vmax` and `vmin`, not the absolute magnitude of the interval.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the condition and subsequent modifications properly address situations where singularities may occur as per the function definition.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        if not increasing:
            return vmax, vmin
        else:
            return vmin, vmax

    if abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the condition `abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny` is used instead of `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` to check for the small interval. Additionally, adjustments to `vmin` and `vmax` are made according to the function definition, considering both relative and absolute differences between the endpoints.
