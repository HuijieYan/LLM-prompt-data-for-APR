Looking at the error message, it seems that the issue occurs when trying to take the absolute value of `int16` numbers (specifically, numpy's `np.int16`). This leads to a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute".

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the line where the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` is calculated: `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This is where the overflow occurs when dealing with `int16` numbers.

The bug occurs because numpy's `np.int16` type overflows when used with the `abs` function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check the types of `vmin` and `vmax` before applying the absolute function. If the types are `int`, the absolute value can be calculated directly without conversion to `int16`.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    # Check if the input types are ints, if so then use the direct abs function
    if isinstance(vmin, int) and isinstance(vmax, int):
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(np.float64(vmin)), abs(np.float64(vmax)))

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, we explicitly check for the input type and ensure that the correct calculation is performed based on the type of `vmin` and `vmax`. This should resolve the overflow issue encountered in the original implementation.
