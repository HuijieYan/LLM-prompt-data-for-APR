The error messages indicate that there are overflow and runtime warning issues occurring within the `nonsingular` function of matplotlib. These issues are related to some calculations involving the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` within the function.

The potential error location is identified in the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` and the subsequent check on `maxabsvalue` being less than a specific threshold.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the calculations involving `vmin` and `vmax` are leading to overflow and runtime warning issues. This is likely due to the use of absolute values and comparison operations on large or small numbers that are causing numerical precision issues.

To fix the bug, the calculations involving `vmin` and `vmax` need to be modified to avoid overflow and runtime warning issues. The bounds and thresholds used in the calculations should be adjusted based on a better understanding of the expected input ranges and the numerical properties of the variables involved.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)  # Modified expansion with absolute value
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)  # Modified expansion with absolute value

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code includes modifications to the expansion calculations based on absolute values, which should help avoid potential overflow and runtime warning issues.
