The error messages indicate that the function `nonsingular` in the `matplotlib.transforms` module is encountering overflow issues and runtime warnings during its execution.

The overflow issues and runtime warnings are likely occurring due to the comparison and absolute value operations in the `nonsingular` function. When dealing with large numbers (like `int16`), the comparison and absolute value calculations can lead to overflow and runtime warnings.

To fix this issue, the comparison and absolute value calculations need to be handled differently to avoid the overflow problems.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function with a possible fix for the overflow issues:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax) or np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or (vmin == 0 and vmax == 0):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(vmax - vmin, tiny)  # Avoid overflow by using the difference and comparing it to 'tiny'
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected function, the comparison and absolute value calculations have been modified to avoid overflow issues. The `if` statement now uses the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` for comparison, and the `maxabsvalue` is compared with `tiny` to prevent overflow. Additionally, there are checks for NaN and infinity values to ensure proper handling of extreme cases.
