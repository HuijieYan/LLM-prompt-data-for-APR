The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the y-axis limits in the `apply_aspect` function. The logic for determining whether to adjust the x or y limits to maintain the correct aspect ratio does not seem to be working correctly.

The reason for the bug could be the complex conditions used to determine whether to expand or shrink the x or y limits to maintain the correct aspect ratio. Additionally, the transformation of the interval values for the x and y limits seems to be incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to simplify the logic for determining which axis to expand, and always choose to expand one of the axes to maintain the aspect ratio. Additionally, correcting the transformation of the interval values for the x and y limits should also be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
# Corrected apply_aspect function
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)
    
    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())
    xsize = max(abs(xmax - xmin), 1e-30)
    ysize = max(abs(ymax - ymin), 1e-30)

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    # Always expand one of the axes to maintain aspect ratio
    if data_ratio > 1:
        y_expander = data_ratio * xsize / ysize - 1
        y0 = ymin - y_expander * (ymax - ymin) / 2
        y1 = ymax + y_expander * (ymax - ymin) / 2
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
    else:
        x_expander = xsize / (data_ratio * ysize) - 1
        x0 = xmin - x_expander * (xmax - xmin) / 2
        x1 = xmax + x_expander * (xmax - xmin) / 2
        self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.inverted().transform, (x0, x1)))
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining which axis to expand has been simplified to always expand one of the axes to maintain the correct aspect ratio. Additionally, the transformation of the x and y limits has been corrected based on the aspect ratio.
