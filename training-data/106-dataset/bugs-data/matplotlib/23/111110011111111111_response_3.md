The error occurs at the assertion `assert ax.get_xlim() == pytest.approx([1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)])` in the test function `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim()`. The error message shows that the expected and obtained values for `ax.get_xlim()` do not match.

The issue is likely occurring within the `apply_aspect` function where the aspect ratio is being adjusted. The function is intended to adjust the axes for a specified data aspect ratio, but it seems to be miscalculating the new axis limits.

Looking at the function, it appears that the calculation of the new axis limits might not be correct. This could be due to incorrect transformations or calculations related to aspect ratios.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the aspect ratio of the axes needs to be reviewed and the calculations for new axis limits need to be checked to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    # The logic for adjusting the aspect ratio is corrected here based on the updated understanding of the code.
    if data_ratio > 1:
        ysize = max(abs(ymax - ymin), 1e-30)
        Ysize = data_ratio * ysize
        yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
        y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
        y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
    else:
        xsize = max(abs(xmax - xmin), 1e-30)
        Xsize = xsize / data_ratio
        xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
        x0 = xc - Xsize / 2.0
        x1 = xc + Xsize / 2.0
        self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.inverted().transform, (x0, x1)))
```

The corrected code addresses the aspect ratio adjustment and should resolve the issue observed in the test function.
