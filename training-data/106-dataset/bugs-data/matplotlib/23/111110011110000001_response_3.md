Potential Error Location:
The error appears to be occurring in the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test case, specifically when asserting the x limits using `assert ax.get_xlim() == pytest.approx([1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)])`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect behavior of the `apply_aspect` function in handling the aspect ratio and adjusting the x-axis limits accordingly. It seems that the function is not calculating the x-axis limits correctly, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic within the `apply_aspect` function to ensure that the calculation of the x-axis limits is accurate.
2. Check the aspect ratio calculation and adjustment process to identify any discrepancies or miscalculations.
3. Debug and test different scenarios related to adjusting the aspect ratio for the x-axis to isolate and correct the issue.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
