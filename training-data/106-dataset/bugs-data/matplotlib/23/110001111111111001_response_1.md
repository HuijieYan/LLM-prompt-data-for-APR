The bug occurs in the `apply_aspect` function. This function is responsible for adjusting the axes for a specified data aspect ratio. It determines what aspect ratio to set based on the plot configuration.

The bug seems to be with the aspect ratio calculation, as the current code results in incorrect output when the `adjustable` parameter is set to "datalim". This causes the assertion error in the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test.

To fix this bug, the aspect ratio calculation and bounds adjustment need to be recalibrated to ensure that the correct aspect ratio is applied when the adjustable parameter is "datalim".

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... Other code remains unchanged ...

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')

    elif self._adjustable == 'datalim':
        # Reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use of 'box'
        self._set_position(position, which='active')

        x0, x1 = self.get_xbound()
        y0, y1 = self.get_ybound()
        aspect_ratio = (y1 - y0) / (x1 - x0)
        box_ratio = fig_aspect * h / w

        if aspect_ratio < box_ratio:
            y_center = 0.5 * (y0 + y1)
            dy = (x1 - x0) * box_ratio - (y1 - y0)
            y0 = y_center - 0.5 * dy
            y1 = y_center + 0.5 * dy
            self.set_ybound(y0, y1)
        else:
            x_center = 0.5 * (x0 + x1)
            dx = (y1 - y0) / box_ratio - (x1 - x0)
            x0 = x_center - 0.5 * dx
            x1 = x_center + 0.5 * dx
            self.set_xbound(x0, x1)

    # Other cases should not occur with the provided variables
```

I've included changes to the code to handle the `'datalim'` case separately, recalculating the bounds based on the box and figure aspect ratios. These adjustments should resolve the aspect ratio calculation issue and correct the test case failure.
