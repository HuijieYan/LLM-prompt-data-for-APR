The bug seems to be located in the section where the x and y limits are being assigned. The code is currently using `x_trf.inverted().transform` instead of `x_trf.transform`. This is causing unexpected behavior when the aspect is set and adjustable is "datalim". 

When the aspect is set and adjustable is "datalim", the code should change either the x or y limits to get the correct aspect. The old code used complex conditions to either expand or shrink one of the axes, which may have resulted in unexpected behavior. Instead, it's suggested to always choose to expand one of the axes to avoid sending artists out of bounds, with the exception of shared axes.

The following is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
