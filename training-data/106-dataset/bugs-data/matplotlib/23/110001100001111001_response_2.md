The error in the given function is likely due to incorrect aspect adjustment. The function `apply_aspect` tries to adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio but it seems to have issues with calculation and conversion of bounds, dimensions, and transforms.

The following changes could be made to fix the bug:
1. Update the calculation of x0, x1, y0, and y1 using a more robust approach, ensuring that the correct bounds are calculated based on the given aspect ratio.
2. Update the calculation of xmarg and ymarg to accurately represent the difference between sizes. This may require adjusting the logic for calculating margins.
3. Ensure that the logic for shared axes is correctly handled, and the adjustments are made accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    dx = xmax - xmin
    dy = ymax - ymin

    if data_ratio > 1:
        dx = dx / data_ratio
    else:
        dy = dy * data_ratio

    if self._shared_x_axes:
        self.set_xbound(xmin, xmin + dx)
    else:
        self.set_xbound(xmin, xmax)

    if self._shared_y_axes:
        self.set_ybound(ymin, ymin + dy)
    else:
        self.set_ybound(ymin, ymax)
```

This corrected function should accurately handle the aspect ratio adjustment and resolve any potential errors encountered in the original function. Please note that the shared axes logic needs to be tested thoroughly to ensure its correctness.
