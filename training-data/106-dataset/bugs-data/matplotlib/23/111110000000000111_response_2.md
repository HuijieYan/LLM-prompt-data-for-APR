The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the datalims are being transformed using the inverted transformation, as pointed out in the GitHub issue title and description.

The bug seems to occur because the code is using inverted transforms when it should be using regular transforms. This is causing issues with aspect ratio adjustment when the adjustable parameter is set to "datalim."

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to use regular transforms instead of inverted transforms for datalims. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the x and y limits to maintain the correct aspect ratio should be reviewed and potentially simplified to avoid sending artists out-of-bounds.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
