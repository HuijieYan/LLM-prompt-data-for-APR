The potential error in the `apply_aspect` function is that it's trying to access the `_adjustable` attribute without defining it within the class. This will result in an AttributeError when trying to access it.

To fix this, the `_adjustable` attribute needs to be defined within the class and initialized to a default value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class _AxesBase(martist.Artist):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self):
        self._adjustable = 'box'  # Set the default value for adjustable

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
        """
        Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

        Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
        (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
        will affect the position.

        Notes
        -----
        This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
        to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
        view limits before the Figure is drawn.
