The error is occurring in a test case (`test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim`) related to the `apply_aspect` function. The test case is trying to validate the x-axis limits (`ax.get_xlim()`) after the `apply_aspect` function has run, but the actual values are not matching the expected values within the tolerance. The error message indicates a significant difference between the obtained and expected values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the new x-axis limits based on the input parameters and the applied aspect ratio.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the x-axis limits after applying the aspect is not consistent with the expected behavior. The actual behavior of the function when calculating these limits does not align with the desired output defined in the test case.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the calculations within the `apply_aspect` function that determine the new x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and input parameters. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the aspect ratio is being applied correctly and consistently to the axis limits.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    # Perform the aspect-based update of the x-axis limits
    xmin, xmax = ax.get_xbound()
    x_center = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
    x_range = (xmax - xmin)
    y_range = x_range / aspect
    ymin = x_center - 0.5 * y_range
    ymax = x_center + 0.5 * y_range
    self.set_xbound(y_trf.inverted().transform(ymin),
                    y_trf.inverted().transform(ymax))
    return
```
In the corrected code, we've adjusted the aspect-based update of the x-axis limits to ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior defined in the test case. We've directly calculated the new y-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and set them using `set_xbound`.
