This bug seems to be occurring due to improper handling of limits and transformations in the `apply_aspect` function. The function is designed to adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio, but it's currently producing incorrect results for the test case provided.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly transforming the data limits according to the aspect ratio. It is using the inverted transformation for axes limits, which results in incorrect calculations for the aspect ratio.

To fix the bug, the `apply_aspect` function should be modified to correctly transform the axes limits based on the aspect ratio. Specifically, the transformation of the data limits should be done using `x_trf.transform` and `y_trf.transform` instead of `x_trf.inverted().transform` and `y_trf.inverted().transform`. Additionally, the logic for expanding the limits based on the aspect ratio should be reviewed and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())
    xsize = max(abs(xmax - xmin), 1e-30)
    ysize = max(abs(ymax - ymin), 1e-30)

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    y_expander = data_ratio * xsize / ysize - 1
    # If y_expander > 0, the dy/dx viewLim ratio needs to increase
    if abs(y_expander) < 0.005:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making these changes, the `apply_aspect` function should now correctly adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio and pass the associated test case without errors.
