The test case `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim()` creates a square plot and sets the aspect ratio to be 1 with an adjustable option of "datalim". It then applies an aspect using the `ax.apply_aspect()` function.

The error message indicates that the x-limits and y-limits obtained from `ax.get_xlim()` and `ax.get_ylim()` respectively do not match the expected values, which causes an assertion error.

The potential error location within the `apply_aspect` function is likely in the calculations related to setting the x and y bounds based on the aspect ratio.

The bug occurs because the calculation for setting the x and y bounds based on the aspect ratio is not correctly implemented. As a result, the calculated x-limits and y-limits do not match the expected values.

To fix the bug, the calculation for setting the x and y bounds based on the aspect ratio needs to be corrected. This might involve reevaluating the process of setting the x and y bounds to ensure that the aspect ratio is properly maintained.

The corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function is as follows:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    xsize = max(abs(xmax - xmin), 1e-30)
    ysize = max(abs(ymax - ymin), 1e-30)
    
    target_aspect = data_ratio * (fig_width / fig_height)

    if target_aspect > 1:
        new_xsize = xsize
        new_ysize = ysize / target_aspect
    else:
        new_xsize = xsize * target_aspect
        new_ysize = ysize

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    position.set_points([l, b, new_xsize, new_ysize])
    self.set_position(position)
```

This corrected code ensures that the x and y bounds are updated according to the desired aspect ratio, as well as other necessary adjustments to maintain the plot's aspect.
