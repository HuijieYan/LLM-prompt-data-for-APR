The error occurs in the function `apply_aspect` in the `matplotlib.axes._base._AxesBase` class. The error message from the test function indicates that the comparison of the x-axis limits fails, which suggests that the aspect adjustment is not working as expected.

The bug in the `apply_aspect` function might be related to the calculation of the data limits and the adjustment of x or y limits to achieve the correct aspect ratio.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of aspect ratio and data limits when the adjustable parameter is set to "datalim". This results in the incorrect calculation of x and y limits, leading to a failed test case.

To fix the bug, the aspect ratio and data limits should be recalculated properly to ensure that the aspect adjustment works as expected when the adjustable parameter is set to "datalim".

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    if adjust_y:
        yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
        y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
        y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.transform, (y0, y1)))
    else:
        xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
        x0 = xc - Xsize / 2.0
        x1 = xc + Xsize / 2.0
        self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.transform, (x0, x1)))
```

This corrected code includes the proper transformation of the x and y limits based on the aspect ratio and data limits, ensuring that the aspect adjustment works correctly when the adjustable parameter is set to "datalim".
