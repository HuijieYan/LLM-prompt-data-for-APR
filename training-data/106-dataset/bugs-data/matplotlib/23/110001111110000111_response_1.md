The error message indicates a comparison failure in the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test function, specifically when asserting the x-axis limits using `assert ax.get_xlim() == pytest.approx([1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)])`. The comparison failed with a mismatch in the obtained and expected values.

The potential error location within the `apply_aspect` function is in the section where the data limits are transformed using `x_trf.inverted().transform`. This transformation may be causing the incorrect calculation of the x-axis limits, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurred because of incorrect transformations applied to the data limits, leading to incorrect calculation and assertion of the x-axis limits in the test function. The transformation using `x_trf.inverted().transform` was not suitable for this context, which resulted in incorrect limits and a failed assertion.

To fix the bug, the transformation of the data limits should be modified to use `x_trf.transform` instead of `x_trf.inverted().transform`.

The corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function is as follows:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By making this change, the transformation of the data limits will use `x_trf.transform` to correctly calculate the x-axis limits and address the comparison failure in the test function.
