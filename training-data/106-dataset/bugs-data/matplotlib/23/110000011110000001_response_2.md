Potential error location: The error is likely related to the apply_aspect function not correctly setting the x-axis and y-axis limits, which causes the test case to fail.

Reasons for the bug: The bug seems to be caused by incorrect calculations or transformations of the x-axis and y-axis limits within the apply_aspect function. This causes the expected and obtained values to differ.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the calculations and transformations related to the x-axis and y-axis limits within the apply_aspect function to ensure they are correct.
2. Verify the logic for setting the x-axis and y-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and adjustable parameter.
3. Consider the scaling and transformation operations involved, and ensure that they align with the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the apply_aspect function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_width / fig_height

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    pb = self.get_position(original=True)

    pb = position.frozen()
    pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(aspect, pb, fig_aspect)

    self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
```
In this corrected code, the adjustments for the aspect ratio and position of the axes are more accurately handled, taking into account the aspect ratio and the adjustable parameter.
