The buggy function `nonsingular` has issues with handling the input values and determining if the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is too small or if the endpoints are not finite. Additionally, the swapping logic is not functioning correctly.

The potential error is in the section where the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` is being evaluated and modified based on the value of `maxabsvalue * tiny`. This part of the code is not properly handling the cases where the interval is too small, leading to incorrect modifications.

The function also fails to handle cases where `vmin` or `vmax` are infinite or NaN.

To fix these issues, we can update the `nonsingular` function to handle the cases of infinite or NaN values, correct the logic for modifying the endpoints, and ensure proper handling of the `expander` and `tiny` parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not (np.isfinite(vmin) and np.isfinite(vmax)) or vmin == vmax:
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if maxabsvalue < 1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code:
- We first check if `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite, or if they are equal. In these cases, we return the modified values.
- We then handle the case where `vmin` is greater than `vmax` based on the `increasing` parameter.
- Next, we calculate the interval and continue with the endpoint modifications based on the interval and `maxabsvalue * tiny`.
- Finally, we handle the swapping if needed based on the `increasing` parameter.

This correction ensures that the function properly handles different input scenarios and correctly modifies the endpoints to avoid singularities.
