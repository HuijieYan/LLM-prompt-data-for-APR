The error occurs because the variables `vmin` and `vmax` are not cast to float before they are used inside the `nonsingular` function. This causes overflow warnings when the function attempts computations on these variables.

To fix this bug, we need to cast `vmin` and `vmax` to float before using them inside the `nonsingular` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    vmin = float(vmin)  # cast vmin to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # cast vmax to float

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the `vmin` and `vmax` variables are cast to float before any computations are performed on them inside the `nonsingular` function. This should resolve the overflow warnings reported in the test case.
