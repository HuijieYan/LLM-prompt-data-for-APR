The issue with the "nonsingular" function lies in the comparison and swapping of vmin and vmax values. The code checks for singularities and swaps the values of vmin and vmax if necessary. However, in some cases, the swapping logic is not implemented correctly and may lead to incorrect results.

The bug occurs when there is an inconsistency in handling the swapping based on the "increasing" parameter. This inconsistency causes incorrect adjustments to the vmin and vmax values, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the swapping logic aligns with the "increasing" parameter. If "increasing" is set to True, the function should swap vmin and vmax if vmin is greater than vmax. If "increasing" is set to False, the swapping should not occur.

Here's the corrected code for the "nonsingular" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing:
        if vmin > vmax:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    else:
        if vmax > vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code ensures that the swapping logic is aligned with the "increasing" parameter, and the function should now handle the singularities consistently.
