The function `nonsingular` has several issues:
1. The function imports the `numpy` module but does not use it anywhere in the function. This causes NameError when trying to execute the function.

2. The condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` in the function is incorrect, as it is trying to use `np` from the numpy module without importing it explicitly.

3. The function does not handle the case where either `vmin` or `vmax` is NaN. It should check if either value is NaN and return the endpoints as -expander and expander.

4. The function logic itself is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made:

1. Import the numpy module at the beginning of the file: `import numpy as np`.

2. Check for NaN values in `vmin` and `vmax` and return -expander and expander if either value is NaN.

3. Simplify the logic of the function to make it more readable and easier to understand.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if np.isnan(vmin) or np.isnan(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
