1. The test case is passing a range of (-20000, 20000) and (-32768, 0) to the function `nonsingular`. The error message indicates that there is a RuntimeWarning for overflow encountered in scalar subtract and overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

2. The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is when calculating `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This is where the overflow warning is being triggered.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is dealing with integer values and directly using them in calculations that might lead to overflow.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Casting `vmin` and `vmax` to floats before using them in calculations to avoid overflow.
   - Handling large integer values by converting them to floating-point numbers to prevent overflow warnings.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
