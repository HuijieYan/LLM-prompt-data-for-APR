The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in the `nonsingular` function in the `transforms.py` file. This overflow happens when calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The issue might occur due to the values of `vmin` and `vmax` being very large and causing an overflow when calculating their absolute values.

To fix this bug, you can consider using the `np.abs` function from NumPy, which is designed to handle large values without causing an overflow. This will ensure that the absolute values are calculated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using `np.abs` to calculate the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`, we can prevent the overflow issue and ensure the correct behavior of the `nonsingular` function.
