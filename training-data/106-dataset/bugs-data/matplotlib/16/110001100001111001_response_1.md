The buggy function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. It includes a check for finite values, swapping the endpoints if necessary, and expanding the interval based on certain conditions.

The bug occurs in the `nonsingular` function when the condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is evaluated. The intention might have been to calculate a ratio and compare it to a threshold, but due to the incorrect formulation, this condition does not function as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly calculate the ratio of `maxabsvalue` and compare it to the threshold. Then, based on the conditions described in the function, we need to update the `vmin` and `vmax` values.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    ratio = (maxabsvalue * tiny) / (1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny)
    if ratio < 1:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code properly calculates the ratio of `maxabsvalue` and compares it to the threshold `1`. If the ratio is less than `1`, it updates the `vmin` and `vmax` values accordingly.
