The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is with the conditions for returning `-expander, expander`. The `if` condition checks if `vmin` or `vmax` are not finite, and if so, it returns `-expander, expander`. 

However, the handling of infinities and NaN is not correct. The function should return `-expander, expander` only if both inputs are inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero. 

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The check for non-finite values does not consider the case when one value is inf and the other is -inf.
2. The condition for returning `-expander, expander` is oversimplified and does not take into account the correct handling of infinities, NaN, or very close to zero inputs.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to rewrite the condition for returning `-expander, expander` to properly handle infinities, NaN, or very small values. It should only return `-expander, expander` if both inputs are inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) and (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if (np.abs(vmin) < tiny and np.abs(vmax) < tiny) or (np.isclose(vmin, 0) and np.isclose(vmax, 0)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
