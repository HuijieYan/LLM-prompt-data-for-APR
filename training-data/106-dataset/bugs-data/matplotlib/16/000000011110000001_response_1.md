The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered when calling the `nonsingular()` function, more specifically when calculating the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

The bug is likely due to the use of `abs()` with very large values that are causing an overflow.

To fix the bug, we should handle the overflow error that occurs when applying `abs()` to very large numbers. One way to handle this is to use the `np.abs()` function instead of Python's built-in `abs()` function, as it provides better support for handling such cases and won't result in overflow.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))  # Using np.abs() to handle large values
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)  # Using np.abs() to handle large values
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)  # Using np.abs() to handle large values

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By using `np.abs()` instead of the built-in `abs()` function, we can avoid the overflow issue when dealing with large numbers.
