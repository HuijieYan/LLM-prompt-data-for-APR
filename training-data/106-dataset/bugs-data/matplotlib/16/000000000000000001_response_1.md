Potential Error:
The potential error location is in the nested if-else statement where the conditions for vmin and vmax are being checked, and adjustments are made accordingly. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when vmax and vmin are both positive or both negative and equal to 0 within the nested if-else statement. This causes the function to return incorrect values for vmin and vmax.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where both vmax and vmin are either both positive or both negative and equal to 0 within the nested if-else statement. Additionally, I will also introduce the necessary import statement for numpy.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        elif vmax * vmin > 0:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
