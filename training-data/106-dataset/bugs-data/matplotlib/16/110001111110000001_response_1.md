The error messages indicate that there are issues related to overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute operations within the `nonsingular` function. These issues are likely caused by the comparison of large absolute values leading to potential overflow problems.

The `maxabsvalue` calculation might be causing the overflow encountered in scalar absolute warning. The comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` in `nonsingular` could be the cause of the overflow encountered in scalar subtraction warning.

To fix the potential bug, we could modify the `nonsingular` function to handle large values without encountering overflow issues. This can be achieved by refactoring the `maxabsvalue` calculation and the interval size comparison.

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True
    
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    
    elif (vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected function, the comparison involving `maxabsvalue` has been modified, and `np.abs` is used instead of `abs` to ensure it handles numpy arrays correctly. Additionally, the condition `maxabsvalue < tiny` has been simplified to avoid overflow issues. These changes should address the potential overflow problems identified in the original function.
