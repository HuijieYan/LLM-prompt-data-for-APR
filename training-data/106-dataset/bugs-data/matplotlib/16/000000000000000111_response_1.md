The potential error in the provided function "nonsingular" is that it does not handle floating-point numbers properly. The function is assuming vmin and vmax to be finite floating-point numbers, but it is not explicitly casting them to floats. This is causing issues when attempting to perform mathematical operations on them.

The bug occurs because when the function tries to compare vmax and vmin, or perform arithmetic operations on them, it does so assuming they are floating-point numbers, which may not always be the case.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly cast vmin and vmax to floats before performing any arithmetic operations on them.

Here's the corrected code for the "nonsingular" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, vmin and vmax are explicitly cast to floats using the `float()` function at the beginning of the "nonsingular" function. This ensures that any operations performed on them are done as floating-point arithmetic.
