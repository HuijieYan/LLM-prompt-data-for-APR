Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `maxabsvalue` variable. The comparison of `maxabsvalue` with the condition `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` could lead to incorrect results.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is not a reliable way to check if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold. The condition does not properly consider the case when `maxabsvalue` is very small, leading to inaccurate results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to compare the interval directly with the `tiny` threshold, rather than using the complicated calculation involving `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`. Another approach is to reconsider the logic of the function to avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure correctness.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin and increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif vmax < vmin and not increasing:
        pass  # do nothing

    if vmax - vmin <= tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
