The function `nonsingular` is used to modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities. The function has multiple conditional checks based on the input values of `vmin` and `vmax`. 

The input parameters are checked for finiteness, and the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are modified based on certain conditions related to their magnitude and distance. If `vmax` is less than `vmin`, the values are swapped.

The bug in the code is that the numpy library is used (`np`) without being imported. Additionally, in some cases, the return values may not be consistent with the inputs due to the conditional checks.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the numpy library at the beginning of the file using `import numpy as np`.
2. Review the conditional checks to ensure they are accurately modifying the endpoints as intended.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
