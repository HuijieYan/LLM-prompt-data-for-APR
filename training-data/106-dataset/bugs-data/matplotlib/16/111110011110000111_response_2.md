Analysis:
The test cases are using negative and positive numbers for the clim parameter, which are causing overflow errors. This indicates that the nonsingular function is not handling negative and large numbers properly.

Error Location:
The potential error location is within the nonsingular function, particularly in the conditional statements that check for edge cases.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the nonsingular function is not properly handling negative and large numbers when performing calculations to expand the interval.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that all calculations within the nonsingular function use floating-point numbers to avoid overflow errors with integer arithmetic.
2. Check for negative and large numbers in the conditional statements to handle them appropriately and prevent overflow errors.
3. Implement additional checks to handle edge cases involving negative and large numbers to avoid overflow errors during interval expansion.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # Cast to float to avoid integer overflow
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif float(vmax) - float(vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Cast to float to avoid integer overflow
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))  # Cast to float to avoid integer overflow
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))  # Cast to float to avoid integer overflow

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected code includes casting to float for all relevant calculations to prevent integer overflow errors. Additionally, it handles negative and large numbers properly to avoid overflow errors during interval expansion.
