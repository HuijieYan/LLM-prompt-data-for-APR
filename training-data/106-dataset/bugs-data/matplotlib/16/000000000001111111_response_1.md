The potential error location within the problematic function is with the comparison of the input variables `vmin` and `vmax` without first casting them to floats. The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the input variables as floats before performing comparisons and calculations, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is important to cast the input variables `vmin` and `vmax` to floats before using them in comparisons and calculations. This will ensure that the function operates on the input variables as floating-point numbers, as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
