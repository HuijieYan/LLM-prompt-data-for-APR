The error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute." This suggests that there may be an overflow issue in the code, particularly in the calculation involving the `abs()` function or subtraction operation.

Upon analyzing the problematic function `nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True)`, the potential error location appears to be in the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` and the subsequent comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to overflow when performing the `abs()` and subtraction operations involving large integer values.

To fix the bug, the calculation methods for `maxabsvalue` and the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` should be updated to handle large integer values and avoid overflow.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # Convert to float to avoid overflow
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif abs(float(vmax) - float(vmin)) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Convert to float and use abs() to avoid overflow
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the integer input values are explicitly converted to float before performing the `abs()` and subtraction operations to avoid overflow issues when dealing with large integer values. Also, the `float()` conversion is added to the `maxabsvalue` calculation to ensure accurate comparison when dealing with large integer values.
