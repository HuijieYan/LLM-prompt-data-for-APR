The potential error in the provided function is the comparison of `vmax` and `vmin` without ensuring that they are both of the same data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with different data types such as integers and floats.

The bug occurs because the function does not explicitly cast `vmin` and `vmax` to floats before performing comparisons and arithmetic operations on them. This can result in unexpected behavior, especially when `vmin` and `vmax` have different data types.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly cast `vmin` and `vmax` to floats before comparing and operating on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    vmin = float(vmin)  # Cast vmin to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Cast vmax to float

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With these changes, we ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are treated as floats throughout the function, preventing unexpected behavior due to mixed data types.
