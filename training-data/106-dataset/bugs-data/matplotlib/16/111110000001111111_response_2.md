The potential error in the given function lies in the calculation and comparison of the values of `vmin` and `vmax`. The function seems to be dealing with various types such as `int`, `float`, and possibly `numpy` types, which might be causing inconsistencies in the calculations and comparisons.

The error occurs when the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are compared and manipulated without ensuring that they are of the same type, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to explicitly convert the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` to floats at the beginning of the function. This will ensure that all subsequent calculations and comparisons are performed consistently on float values.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
