The potential error in the `nonsingular` function lies in the operations performed on the input values, `vmin` and `vmax`. The function checks if the input values are finite, then it swaps them if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. After that, it calculates the `maxabsvalue` and performs further operations based on its value.

The bug occurs because the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` might be of type `int` or `int16`, leading to potential issues with floating-point arithmetic operations. This can cause unexpected results, especially when dealing with very small values close to zero.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to explicitly cast the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` to float before performing any floating-point arithmetic operations on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly casting `vmin` and `vmax` to float at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent floating-point arithmetic operations are performed correctly. This should address the potential issues with unexpected results or errors due to using integer values in floating-point calculations.
