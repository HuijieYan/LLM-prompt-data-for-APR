Potential error location: The potential error in the function is where the expander and tiny values are used to check and modify the endpoints. 

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the condition for modifying the endpoints based on the size of the interval is not implemented correctly. Additionally, the np.finfo(float).tiny value might vary based on the system, leading to inconsistent behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Use a relative tolerance approach to check and modify the endpoints, rather than using absolute values based on expander and tiny.
2. Use np.spacing to determine the appropriate tiny value for the system.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=None, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: None
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  If None, it will be set to np.spacing(1).
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

     swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if tiny is None:
        tiny = np.spacing(1)

        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
