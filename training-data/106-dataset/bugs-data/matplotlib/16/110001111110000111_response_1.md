The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered in the calculation of the absolute value of vmin or vmax. This points to the location within the `nonsingular` function where the `maxabsvalue` is calculated using the `max` and `abs` functions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `vmin` and `vmax` values may be of type `int` or `int16`, and when taking the absolute value or using them in arithmetic operations, overflow errors may occur. This is because integer types have a limited range of values they can represent, and if the absolute value or arithmetic operation exceeds this range, an overflow occurs.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to cast `vmin` and `vmax` to float before performing any arithmetic operations, taking absolute values, or comparing them. By casting them to float early in the function, we ensure that the calculations involving them are done using floating-point arithmetic, which has a larger range of representable values compared to integer types.

Here is the corrected function with the suggested fix:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
