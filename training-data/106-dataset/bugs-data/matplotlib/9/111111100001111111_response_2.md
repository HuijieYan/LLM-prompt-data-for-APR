The issue is related to drawing a polar plot with the r-origin set manually. When saving the plot as a PNG, the resulting image does not reflect the expected output. However, saving it as a PDF or working interactively with the UI gives the expected result.

The bug is likely occurring in the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class. The `rmin` value is calculated by subtracting `self.get_rorigin()` from `self._realViewLim.intervaly` and then multiplying it by `self.get_rsign()`. However, it seems like the calculation for `rmin` is incorrect, leading to unexpected results when saving the plot as a PNG.

To fix the bug, the calculation for `rmin` should be corrected. Additionally, the visibility of some elements such as `start` and `end` should also be handled properly to ensure the correct rendering of the plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `draw` method:

```python
# corrected draw method
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    
    rmin = self._realViewLim.intervaly.min
    rmax = self._realViewLim.intervaly.max
    
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, `rmin` is calculated as the minimum value of `self._realViewLim.intervaly`, and `rmax` as the maximum value. This ensures that the calculation of `rmin` is corrected. Additionally, the visibility of the elements `start` and `end` is handled based on the `visible` variable to ensure the correct rendering of the plot.
