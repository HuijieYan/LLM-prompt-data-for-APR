The error message indicates that the images produced by the test function `test_polar_invertedylim_rorigin` do not match the expected images. This suggests that there is a problem with the `draw` function which is responsible for drawing the polar plot.

The potential error location within the `draw` function is in the calculation of `rmin` and `rmax`. It seems that there is an issue with the calculation of these values, which could be causing the polar plot to be drawn incorrectly.

The bug occurred due to incorrect calculation of `rmin` and `rmax` values, which are used to determine the radius and width of the polar plot. This could result in the polar plot not being drawn as expected, leading to the test case failure.

To fix the bug, the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax` needs to be corrected to ensure that the radius and width of the polar plot are calculated accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `draw` function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) *
                  self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By correcting the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax`, the bug in the `draw` function should be resolved, and the test case should produce the expected images.
