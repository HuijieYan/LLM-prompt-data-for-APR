The buggy function seems to be causing problems when saving a polar plot as a PNG with r-origin set. This is likely due to a bug in the draw function, specifically in the calculations for rmin and rmax.

The bug occurs because self._realViewLim.intervaly might be a single value rather than an interval, which could cause issues in the subsequent calculations for rmin and rmax. Additionally, the calculation for rmax uses self.get_rsign(), which might not return the expected value.

To fix the bug, we should update the code to handle the case where self._realViewLim.intervaly is a single value. Additionally, make sure that the calculations for rmin and rmax accurately reflect the intended behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the draw function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin

    # Handle cases where self._realViewLim.intervaly is a single value
    if isinstance(self._realViewLim.intervaly, float):
        rmin, rmax = (self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign(), 0
    else:
        rmin, rmax = (self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign()

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

By handling the edge case where self._realViewLim.intervaly is a single value and ensuring accurate calculations for rmin and rmax, we can fix the bug in the draw function.
