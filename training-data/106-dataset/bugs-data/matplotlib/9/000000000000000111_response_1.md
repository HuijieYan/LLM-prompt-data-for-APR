The error in the given function seems to be related to the rendering of a polar plot with a custom r-origin set. This is indicated by the error description that mentions the problem occurring specifically when setting the r-origin using the `ax_g.set_rorigin(-78)` method. The error seems to only occur when saving the plot as a png, but works as expected when saving it as a PDF or when using the UI to save it.

Based on the error description, the issue appears to be related to the transformation of the polar plot when a custom r-origin is set. The provided function `draw` is likely responsible for rendering the polar plot, and it may not be handling the custom r-origin correctly, resulting in incorrect rendering when the plot is saved as a png.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the transformation of the polar plot when a custom r-origin is set. This may involve modifying the section of the function that deals with the r-origin and its transformation. Additionally, checking for any potential inconsistencies with the rendering when saving as a png specifically would be important.

The corrected function for the `draw` method:

```python
def draw(self, renderer):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    # For backwards compatibility, any subclassed Axes might override the spines to not include start/end that PolarAxes uses.
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer)
```
