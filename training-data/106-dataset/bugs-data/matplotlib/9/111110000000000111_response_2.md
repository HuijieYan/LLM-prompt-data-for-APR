1. The test case provided is related to saving a polar plot as a PNG with the r-origin set "by hand." The issue occurs when using the `ax_g.set_rorigin(-78)` method, where saving the plot as a PNG does not work as expected, but saving it as a PDF does. This behavior suggests that the issue might be related to the rendering of the plot when the r-origin is manually set.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `draw` method of the `PolarAxes` class, as it contains the logic for rendering the polar plot.

3. The bug occurs due to a potential compatibility issue with setting the r-origin manually for the polar plot and the rendering mechanism for saving the plot as a PNG. This could be related to how the r-origin value is handled and updated during the rendering process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking for any discrepancies in how the renderer handles the r-origin when saving the plot as a PNG and addressing it accordingly.
   - Verifying the compatibility of setting the r-origin manually with the rendering process, and making necessary adjustments to ensure proper rendering in all formats.
   - Ensuring that the logic for handling the r-origin in the `draw` method accounts for different rendering scenarios, especially when the r-origin is manually set.

5. Corrected code for the problematic `draw` method:

```python
# this is the corrected draw function
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) *
                  self.get_rsign())
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    super().draw(renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```
In the corrected code, the `Axes.draw` method has been replaced with `super().draw` to ensure that the superclass method is called. This helps in ensuring that the rendering of the polar plot accounts for any specific adjustments made to the r-origin.
