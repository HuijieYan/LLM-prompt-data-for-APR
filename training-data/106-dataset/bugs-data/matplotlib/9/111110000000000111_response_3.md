The issue appears to be related to the `set_rorigin` method in the provided test case. When a png plot is saved, it does not work as expected while saving it as a PDF works as expected.

The potential error in the problematic function `draw` lies in the calculation of `rmin` and `rmax` using `self.get_rorigin()` and `self.get_rsign()` respectively. It seems like the issue might be related to these calculations affecting the polar plot rendering when the r-origin is set.

The bug occurs because the `draw` method in the PolarAxes class is not handling the r-origin setting correctly, leading to issues with rendering the polar plot when the r-origin is manually set.

To fix the bug, the `draw` method needs to be updated to handle the r-origin setting properly. This might involve revisiting the calculations for `rmin` and `rmax` and ensuring that they accurately account for the r-origin setting.

Here's the corrected code for the `draw` method in the PolarAxes class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    radians = np.deg2rad(thetamin), np.deg2rad(thetamax)
    r_abs = self._realViewLim.intervaly
    rorigin = self.get_rorigin()
    rsign = self.get_rsign()
    rmin = r_abs - rorigin * rsign
    rmax = r_abs
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        pass
    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax` has been updated to accurately account for the r-origin setting. This should address the issue with rendering the polar plot when the r-origin is manually set.
