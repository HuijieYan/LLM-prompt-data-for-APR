The bug seems to be related to the `set_rorigin` method in the provided example. When saving a PNG of a polar plot with the r-origin set by using the `set_rorigin` method, the plot does not work as expected. However, saving it as a PDF or using the UI to save it as a PNG works as expected.

The provided buggy function does several calculations and transformations related to polar plots. The bug could be related to these calculations, particularly those involving the setting of the r-origin.

One potential approach for fixing the bug is to closely examine the calculations related to the r-origin and ensure that they are being handled correctly. Additionally, it might be necessary to consider how the r-origin is used in the context of saving the plot as a PNG.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    @cbook._delete_parameter("3.3", "args")
    @cbook._delete_parameter("3.3", "kwargs")
    def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
        thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
        if thetamin > thetamax:
            thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
        rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign())
        if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
            # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
            # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
            center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
            self.patch.set_center(center)
            self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
            self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

            # The code related to radius and width calculation has been fixed below
            edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
            radius = edge - center[0]
            width = radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax  # Corrected calculation
            self.patch.set_radius(radius)
            self.patch.set_width(width)

            inner_width = radius - width
            inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
            if inner:
                inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

        visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
        start = self.spines.get('start', None)
        end = self.spines.get('end', None)
        if start:
            start.set_visible(visible)
        if end:
            end.set_visible(visible)
        if visible:
            yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
        else:
            yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
        if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
            self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
            self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
            self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

        Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```
