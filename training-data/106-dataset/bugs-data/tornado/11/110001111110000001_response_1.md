The error message indicates that the response obtained from the test case does not match the expected response. The `json_decode(response)` statement in the test case is expected to return `{u'foo': [u'bar']}` but it is returning an empty dictionary `{}` instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_read_body` is likely to be in the logic that determines how to read the body of the response based on the headers and content length.

The bug may be occurring because the function `_read_body` does not handle the chunked encoding properly, leading to an incorrect empty dictionary being returned instead of the expected response.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling chunked encoding needs to be corrected to properly parse the chunked data and decode it into the expected response.

Here's the corrected function for `_read_body`:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")

        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    else:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        if self.is_client:
            return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
```

This corrected function includes proper handling for chunked encoding and content length, ensuring that the correct body reading method is chosen based on the headers provided in the response.
