Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the if statement `if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:`. It seems to be checking if the Content-Length header contains a comma, which is not the correct way to handle the Content-Length header.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly checking for a comma in the Content-Length header. The Content-Length header should only contain a single value representing the length of the body content.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The correct approach for handling the Content-Length header is to check if it exists and then simply parse the integer value to determine the length of the body content. Additionally, proxies causing duplication of the header should not be a concern at this level, and should be handled at a lower level if necessary.

Corrected code:
```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")

        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
