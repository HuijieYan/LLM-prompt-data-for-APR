The error message is indicating that the expected response from the `json_decode` function is not matching the actual response.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the chunked request. The `_read_body` function seems to be incorrectly processing the chunked request. It is not parsing the chunks properly and not decoding the response accordingly.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` function is not correctly parsing and decoding the chunked request, leading to an incorrect response.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be modified to properly parse the chunked request and decode the response. This can be achieved by ensuring that the chunked request is parsed correctly and then decoding the chunks to construct the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        # Handle Content-Length header
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        # Handle chunked request
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

By making these changes, the `_read_body` function should now correctly handle the chunked request and decode the response. This should fix the bug encountered in the test case.
