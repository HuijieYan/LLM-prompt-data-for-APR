The problem here seems to be with the processing of the chunked request in the `_read_body` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The error message from the test function suggests that the response received does not match the expected response, indicating a failure in processing the chunked request.

The potential error in the `_read_body` function lies in the handling of chunked request bodies. There could be an issue with parsing and processing the chunked data to reconstruct the original message body.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` function does not correctly handle the chunked request. It tries to parse the chunked data, but the parsing logic seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect decoding of the request body.

To fix this bug, the `_read_body` function should be updated to correctly parse and process the chunked request. This involves reading and assembling the chunks until a zero-length chunk is received, which signals the end of the chunked request body.

Here's the corrected `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        # code for handling Content-Length
        pass
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

Additionally, the logic for handling chunked requests should be revised and tested thoroughly to ensure the correct processing of chunked request bodies.
