The bug occurs in the `_read_body` function. When the "Content-Length" header is present in the headers, the code checks if the length is too long and handles multiple unequal values. It then tries to convert the content length to an integer and proceeds based on that value. However, the code does not handle the case where the content length is not present or is invalid, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should first handle the case where the "Content-Length" header is not present or has an invalid value. In this case, we should set `content_length` to `None` and proceed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
    if content_length:
        if "," in content_length:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = int(pieces[0])
        else:
            try:
                content_length = int(content_length)
            except ValueError:
                # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0
    
    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

With this correction, the function properly handles the case where the "Content-Length" header is not present or has an invalid value.
