The buggy function `_read_body` is responsible for reading the body of an HTTP response. It checks for the presence of "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers to determine the length of the response body and then proceeds to read the body accordingly.

The bug occurs when checking for the presence of "Content-Length" in the headers. The code checks if the "Content-Length" header contains a comma, which is incorrect because the header should not contain a comma-separated list of values. This check can lead to a runtime error.

To fix this bug, the code should check if the "Content-Length" header exists and then directly parse the value to an integer without splitting it by commas.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        try:
            content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length"))
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed")
        if content_length is None:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Invalid Content-Length value")
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

This corrected code removes the incorrect check for commas in the "Content-Length" header and directly tries to parse the value to an integer. It also includes validity checks for the parsed content length.
