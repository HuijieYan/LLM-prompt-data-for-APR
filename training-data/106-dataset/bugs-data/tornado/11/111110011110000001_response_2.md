The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` seems to be sending a chunked request with the body "foo=bar" in the test. However, the test is expecting a response with the JSON object `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`, indicating that the response should have a JSON object with a key "foo" and a value of an array containing "bar".

The error message indicates that the response received is an empty JSON object `{}` instead of the expected `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_read_body` method. It seems that the function is not handling the chunked request properly, leading to an incorrect response.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` method is not properly processing the chunked request and generating the correct response. This results in an empty response being received instead of the expected JSON object.

To fix this bug, the `_read_body` method needs to be modified to properly handle the chunked request and generate the correct response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        body = self.stream.read_bytes(content_length, partial=True)
        delegate.data_received(body)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        while True:
            line = self.stream.read_until(b"\r\n")
            if line == b"0\r\n":
                break
            size = int(line, 16)
            chunk = self.stream.read_bytes(size + 2, partial=True)  # +2 for \r\n
            delegate.data_received(chunk[:-2])  # Remove the \r\n
    else:
        # Handle other cases like read-until-close
        pass
```

In this corrected code, we are properly handling the chunked request and processing the chunks to generate the correct response. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
