The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` is sending a POST request to the server with a body in chunked encoding. The expected response is a dictionary with the decoded body content. However, the response is not as expected, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error in the `_read_body` function is that when parsing the response, it's not handling the chunked encoding correctly, causing the response to be decoded incorrectly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_read_body` function is not properly handling the chunked encoding when reading the response body from a POST request.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be updated to correctly handle the chunked encoding in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    else:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
```

In the corrected code, the condition for handling chunked encoding has been updated to check if the "Transfer-Encoding" header is present and its value is "chunked" in a case-insensitive manner. If the condition is met, the `self._read_chunked_body` function is called to properly decode the chunked response.
