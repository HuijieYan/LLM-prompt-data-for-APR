The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends a chunked HTTP request to the server and expects the response to contain the parsed JSON data. However, the actual response is an empty JSON object, leading to an assertion error.

The bug is likely in the `_read_body` method where the content length is being calculated and used to determine how to read the body of the HTTP request. The bug is probably related to how the content length is being handled and used to read the body.

The content length calculation and validation should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly reflects the length of the request body and that it is properly used to read the request body.

A potential approach for fixing the bug could involve thoroughly inspecting the parsing and content length calculation logic and verifying that it aligns with the HTTP protocol specifications. Additionally, checking the handling of chunked encoding and the decision-making process for reading the body based on different scenarios could help in identifying and fixing the bug.

Below is the corrected code for the `_read_body` method:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```

In the corrected code, the validations related to content length have been restructured, and the handling of different scenarios based on content length and transfer encoding has been adjusted to align with the HTTP protocol specifications.
