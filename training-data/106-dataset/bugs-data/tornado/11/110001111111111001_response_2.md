The test case "test_chunked_request_uppercase" sends a chunked POST request to an endpoint and expects a certain response. The error message indicates that the response received does not match the expected response.

Looking at the buggy function "_read_body", the issue might be related to how the function handles chunked requests and processes the response based on the headers and content length.

The bug appears to be related to how the function processes the chunked request body and constructs the response. It seems that the function may not be properly decoding the chunked request body or creating the response content correctly.

To address this issue, the function "_read_body" should properly handle chunked request bodies, parse the content, and construct the response accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the "_read_body" function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers is not allowed.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None
    
    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0
    
    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif not self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```

In this corrected version, the function properly checks for the presence of the "Transfer-Encoding" header and handles chunked requests by calling the "_read_chunked_body" function. Additionally, the conditions for constructing the response have been adjusted to ensure the correct handling of chunked requests.

This corrected code should address the issue encountered in the test case "test_chunked_request_uppercase" and produce the expected response.
