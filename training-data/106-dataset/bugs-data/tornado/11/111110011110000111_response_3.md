The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` is sending a chunked request to the `HTTP1Connection` class and expecting a specific response. However, the response received does not match the expected response, resulting in an assertion error.

The potential error location within the `_read_body` function is likely the handling of the chunked encoding. The function is trying to parse the chunked body but may not be interpreting it correctly, leading to an incorrect response.

The bug is occurring because the `_read_body` function is not correctly handling the chunked encoding of the response. This causes the response body to be processed incorrectly, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be modified to handle the chunked encoding properly. This may involve parsing the chunked body according to the HTTP specification and ensuring that it is decoded correctly before being returned as the response body.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the handling of chunked encoding has been modified to ensure that the chunked body is parsed and decoded correctly. This should resolve the issue and align the behavior of the `_read_body` function with the expectations of the test case.
