The error occurs in the test_chunked_request_uppercase test. The test sends a POST request with a chunked transfer encoding, containing the key-value pair 'foo=bar'. However, the expected response is {u'foo': [u'bar']}, but the actual response is an empty dictionary {}.

In the _read_body function, when content_length is not None and code is not 204, the function is expected to read the fixed body. However, the fixed body is not being read correctly, resulting in an empty response.

The issue could be due to an incorrect implementation of reading fixed body when the content length is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fixed body is read correctly when the content length is not None and the code is not 204.

Here is the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        
        if content_length == 0:
            return None  # Empty body
        
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```

With this correction, the function will correctly read the fixed body when the content length is not None and the code is not 204. This should resolve the issue in the test.
