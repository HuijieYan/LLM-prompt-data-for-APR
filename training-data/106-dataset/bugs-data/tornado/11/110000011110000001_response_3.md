The test_chunked_request_uppercase test case is sending a chunked request to the server and expecting a response with a JSON body containing the key "foo" and value ["bar"]. However, the test is failing with an AssertionError because the response is an empty dictionary rather than the expected JSON.

The potential error location within the _read_body function is likely in the section that handles chunked encoding and reads the body.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to how the _read_body function processes the chunked encoding and constructs the response body. It seems that the function is not correctly parsing the chunked request and generating the expected response.

To fix the bug, the _read_body function needs to be modified to correctly handle chunked encoding and construct the response body based on the incoming chunked request.

Here's the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected _read_body function, we first check for the presence of "Content-Length" in the headers. If it's present, we handle it accordingly. Otherwise, we check for chunked encoding and delegate the processing to the _read_chunked_body method. Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, we return None.

This should resolve the issue with processing chunked requests and generating the correct response.
