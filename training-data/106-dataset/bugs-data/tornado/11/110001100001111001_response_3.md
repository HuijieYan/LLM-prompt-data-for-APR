The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle cases where "Content-Length" is a comma-separated list of values. This can lead to the error being raised when trying to convert a non-integer "Content-Length" to an integer, as well as not properly handling the case where multiple "Content-Length" values are provided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle comma-separated "Content-Length" values and account for cases where multiple unequal "Content-Lengths" are provided.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import re
from tornado import httputil

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers["Content-Length"]
        if "," in content_length:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
            # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
            # use them but if they differ it's an error.
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
