The bug is occurring in the `_read_body` function. The content_length is being set to 16 in the buggy case which is incorrect. We expect it to be 2 in the expected case. This suggests that the calculation for content_length is incorrect.

The issue is likely occurring because the Content-Length header is being processed incorrectly, leading to the incorrect assignment of the content_length variable.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for processing the Content-Length header and calculating the content_length.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"][0])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None
    
    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0
    
    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the Content-Length header is present in the headers. If it is, we extract the first value (in case multiple values are present) and convert it to an integer to obtain the content length. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect assignment of content_length.
