The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the "Content-Length" header. The function checks for the presence of "Content-Length" in the headers and then attempts to process the value. There are a few potential issues in the code:

1. The condition `if "," in headers["Content-Length"]` checks for a comma in the content-length value, which is unconventional. Instead, it should be checking for a single value representing the content length.

2. The code is using the `re` module without importing it, which would result in an error.

3. Content-Length is being split into pieces and checked for equality, which may not reflect the actual content length.

To fix the bug, we need to:

1. Validate the content length directly without splitting or checking for the presence of a comma.

2. Remove the unnecessary import and code related to the split operation.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
