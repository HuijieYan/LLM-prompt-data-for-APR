The error seems to be related to the decoding of the response generated by the `test_chunked_request_uppercase` test case. The response should be decoded to JSON and compared with the expected output.

Looking at the `test_chunked_request_uppercase` function, it seems to be sending a POST request with a body containing form-urlencoded data in chunked encoding. The response is then decoded as JSON and checked if it matches the expected output, `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`.

The potential error in the `_read_body` method exists in the way it processes the chunked data and constructs the response. It seems that the chunked encoding for the request body is not handled correctly, leading to an incorrect response being generated. This could be the reason for the failed assertion in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` method should be modified to correctly handle chunked encoding. Additionally, the response should be properly constructed and returned as JSON, matching the expected output `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `_read_body` method:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        content_length = None

    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "Chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)

    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)

    return None
```

In the corrected method, we first check for the presence of the "Content-Length" header and then handle the chunked encoding as a separate case. If the transfer encoding is chunked, the method calls `_read_chunked_body` to process the chunked data. Otherwise, it falls back to reading the body until the connection is closed.

With these changes, the `test_chunked_request_uppercase` test case should pass without any assertion errors.
