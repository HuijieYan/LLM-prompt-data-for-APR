Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the function is not properly handling the case where the "Content-Length" header has multiple values separated by commas. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code splits the "Content-Length" header by commas and checks if all the values are equal. However, it does not handle the case where the "Content-Length" header has multiple values separated by commas.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the "Content-Length" header has multiple values separated by commas. We can split the header by commas, then iterate through the values to check if they are all valid integers. If all the values are valid integers, we can use the first value as the content length. If any value is not a valid integer, we should raise an error.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers["Content-Length"]
        if "," in content_length:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
            # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
            # use them but if they differ it's an error.
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            try:
                content_lengths = [int(piece) for piece in pieces]
                if all(i == content_lengths[0] for i in content_lengths):
                    content_length = content_lengths[0]
                else:
                    raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                        "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            except ValueError:
                # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
