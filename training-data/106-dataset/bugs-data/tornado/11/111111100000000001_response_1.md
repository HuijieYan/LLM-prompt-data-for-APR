The potential error in the `_read_body` function is that it checks for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the response. According to the HTTP specification (RFC7230), a response cannot contain both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be modified to check for the presence of "Transfer-Encoding" first, and only then check for "Content-Length". If "Transfer-Encoding" is present, the function should use chunked encoding for reading the body. If "Content-Length" is present, the function should read the body based on the content length.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        if headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        else:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Unsupported Transfer-Encoding: %s" % headers["Transfer-Encoding"])
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Invalid Content-Length header: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        
        if code == 204 and content_length != 0:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code 204 should not have body")
        
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    else:
        # If neither Transfer-Encoding nor Content-Length is present, read until close
        if self.is_client:
            return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
        return None
```

In the corrected code, we first check for the presence of "Transfer-Encoding" and handle chunked encoding. If "Transfer-Encoding" is not present, we then check for "Content-Length" and handle the body based on the content length. If neither "Transfer-Encoding" nor "Content-Length" is present, we handle the body by reading until the connection is closed.
