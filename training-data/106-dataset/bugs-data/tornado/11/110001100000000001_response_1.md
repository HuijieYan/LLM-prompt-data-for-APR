The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. The function is trying to handle different scenarios related to these headers, but the logic is flawed, leading to potential bugs.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to handle cases where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present, as well as cases where the "Content-Length" header contains multiple values separated by commas. Additionally, there is a check for the response code 204 which should not have a body.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for handling "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers by focusing on the most common cases and avoiding extensive checks for edge cases. Similarly, the handling of response code 204 should be improved by explicitly setting the body length to 0.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length", 0))
    transfer_encoding = headers.get("Transfer-Encoding", "")

    if content_length > self._max_body_size:
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body
        content_length = 0

    if content_length > 0:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif transfer_encoding == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the handling of "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers is simplified, and the logic for handling the response code 204 is made more explicit.
