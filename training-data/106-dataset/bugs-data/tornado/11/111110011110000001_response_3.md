The test function `test_chunked_request_uppercase` is trying to send a chunked request to the server and validate the response. The error message indicates that the response does not match the expected response.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_read_body` is likely in the logic related to parsing the chunked encoding and handling the response.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` function does not correctly handle the chunked encoding and parsing of the response. It fails to properly decode chunked data in the response and map it to the expected JSON response.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_read_body` function correctly handles and decodes the chunked encoding and parses the response payload into the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
