The error message indicates that the `json_decode` function is returning an empty dictionary `{}`, while the expected result is `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`. This suggests that there is an issue with parsing the response body.

The potential error in the `_read_body` function is likely related to the handling of chunked transfer encoding.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the chunked transfer encoding. As a result, the response body is not correctly parsed, leading to the empty dictionary returned by `json_decode`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_read_chunked_body` method is correctly implemented to handle chunked transfer encoding and properly parse the response body.

Here's the corrected `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")

        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In this corrected version, we have made sure to handle the chunked transfer encoding by calling the `_read_chunked_body` method and properly parsing the response body. This should fix the bug and produce the correct response for the test case.
