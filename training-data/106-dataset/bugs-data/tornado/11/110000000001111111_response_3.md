The bug occurs due to the incorrect parsing of the "Content-Length" header in the `_read_body` method. 

The issue originates from the line:
```python
if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
```
This line checks if there are multiple values in the "Content-Length" header by searching for a comma. However, the correct way to handle multiple values in the "Content-Length" header is to split the values by commas and then take the first value, as indicated by the subsequent code.

To fix this bug, the code for checking multiple values in the "Content-Length" header needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` method:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
        if "," in content_length:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            content_length = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
``` 

In the corrected code, we store the value of the "Content-Length" header in a variable `content_length`, and then we check if it contains a comma to handle multiple values correctly.

This fix ensures that the "Content-Length" header is parsed correctly, and the code should function as expected in both the provided test cases.
