The test function `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends a chunked HTTP request with a payload and expects to receive a JSON response. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the expected response is `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`, but the actual response is an empty dictionary `{}`.

The bug in the `_read_body` function is likely causing this failure, specifically in the logic for handling chunked encoding.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` function incorrectly handles chunked encoding. Instead of correctly parsing the chunked data and using it to construct the response, it attempts to read the body with a delegate function. This incorrect handling results in a failure to process and properly return the chunked data, which leads to an empty response.

To fix this bug, the `_read_body` method needs to be modified to parse and process the chunked data properly, creating the expected response dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` method:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        # Parse the chunked data to construct the response
        return self._parse_chunked_data(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

In the corrected code, there's a new method `_parse_chunked_data` added to handle the chunked encoding and construct the response. This method will correctly parse the chunked data and create the expected response.
