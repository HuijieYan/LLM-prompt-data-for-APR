The test_chunked_request_uppercase test case is trying to send a chunked request to the server and expects the response to be parsed as JSON, with the expected value being {u'foo': [u'bar']}. However, the actual response is an empty dictionary, {}.

The potential error location is in the _read_body method where the handling of chunked requests and the parsing of the response is not being done correctly. This results in an incorrect JSON response being returned.

The bug occurs because the code in the _read_body method does not properly handle the chunked Transfer-Encoding. 

To fix the bug, the chunked Transfer-Encoding should be properly processed and the response should be parsed as JSON.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function _read_body:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    
    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0
    
    if content_length is not None and content_length > 0:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```

In the corrected code, the chunked Transfer-Encoding is properly handled by calling the _read_chunked_body method. Additionally, the response is expected to be in JSON format, so the parsing of the response should be done accordingly.
