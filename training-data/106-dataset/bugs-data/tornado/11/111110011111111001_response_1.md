The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends a chunked POST request with the body "foo=bar". The expected response is a JSON object with the key "foo" and value "bar".

The error message shows that the response is not as expected. This implies that there is a problem with how the response body is being processed and returned in the `_read_body` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class.

Upon reviewing the `_read_body` function, it seems that the content length calculation may be incorrect, leading to an incorrect response being returned.

The bug may be occurring because the function does not handle chunked transfer encoding properly, which is likely causing the issue in processing the request body and returning the correct response.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_read_body` function to correctly handle chunked transfer encoding, ensuring that the request body is processed and returned accurately. Additionally, we should ensure that the function is able to correctly parse the input headers and determine the length of the content.

Here's the corrected `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
        if "Content-Length" in headers:
            if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
            try:
                content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
            except ValueError:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        else:
            content_length = None

        if code == 204 and (headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or content_length != 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)

        if content_length is not None:
            return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
        elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        else:
            return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
```
