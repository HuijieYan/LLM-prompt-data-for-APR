Potential error location:
The issue might be in the `if "," in headers["Content-Length"]` block, where it checks for multiple values of Content-Length header.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might occur because splitting the Content-Length header by a comma does not account for the possibility of multiple values when dealing with proxies. It also does not handle cases where the Content-Length header has multiple unequal values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the splitting by comma and simply check if the Content-Length is an integer.
2. Check for and handle cases where the Content-Length header has multiple unequal values.
3. Use a different method for handling cases where Content-Length is duplicated due to proxies.

Corrected code:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        if not headers["Content-Length"].isdigit():
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
