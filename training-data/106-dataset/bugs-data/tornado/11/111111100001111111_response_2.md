The buggy function is responsible for reading the body of an HTTP request. The error occurs when checking if "Content-Length" is in the headers, and then if "Transfer-Encoding" is also in the headers. If both of these headers exist, an httputil.HTTPInputError is raised.

The error occurs due to a logical mistake in the conditional statement. It is impossible for both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers to coexist in an HTTP response. Therefore, the condition should be 'if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers'.

Additionally, it seems that the code incorrectly handles the case where multiple Content-Length headers might be present. The current implementation splits the content length in case of multiple values and checks for equality, which is not necessary.

To fix the bug, the conditions should be revised and simplified. It is also advised to remove the unnecessary and incorrect handling of multiple Content-Length headers.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        if headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif code == 204:
        if content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code 204 should not have body")
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
