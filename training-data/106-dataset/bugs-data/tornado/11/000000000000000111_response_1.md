Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is in the logic for handling the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. The function should determine the appropriate action based on the presence of these headers, but the current implementation has some issues handling different scenarios.

Reasons Behind the Bug: 
The current implementation does not properly handle cases where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present and where "Content-Length" is a comma-separated list of values. It also does not handle the case where the content length is not an integer.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers and raise an error if both are present.
2. Handle the case where "Content-Length" is a comma-separated list of values by either using the first value or raising an error if the values are not identical.
3. Handle the case where the content length is not an integer by raising an error.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers["Content-Length"]
        if "," in content_length:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = int(pieces[0])
        else:
            try:
                content_length = int(content_length)
            except ValueError:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
