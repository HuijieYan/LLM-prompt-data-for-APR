Potential error location: The potential error location in the problematic function is the part where it checks for "Content-Length" in headers.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for the presence of a comma in the "Content-Length" header and splitting it based on that. This logic is incorrect and can lead to errors, especially when dealing with proxies that may duplicate the "Content-Length" header values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Instead of splitting the "Content-Length" header based on a comma, the function can simply extract the value of "Content-Length" and attempt to convert it to an integer directly.
2. It can then check if the value is a valid integer and handle the error appropriately if it's not.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
