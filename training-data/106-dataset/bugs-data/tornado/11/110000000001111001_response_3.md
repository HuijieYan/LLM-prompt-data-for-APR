The potential error in the `_read_body` function lies in the handling of the 'Content-Length' header. The code checks if the header contains a comma and then tries to split it, which is not necessary. The main issue here is that it checks if the header contains a comma, and if it does, it tries to split it, which could be causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the issue, we can directly convert the 'Content-Length' header value to an integer without splitting it and checking for commas. Additionally, the bug may also lie in the parsing of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header and the handling of the code 204 response.

Here is the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

This corrected code simplifies the handling of the 'Content-Length' header and removes unnecessary checks and splitting of the header value. It also addresses the potential issues related to the 'Transfer-Encoding' header and the code 204 response.
