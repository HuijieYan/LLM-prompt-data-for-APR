The test_chunked_request_uppercase function is a unit test that sends a chunked request to the server and expects a specific response. The error message indicates that the response received does not match the expected response.

The potential error location within the _read_body function is likely in the handling of the chunked encoding. It seems that the response is not being decoded and parsed correctly, leading to the incorrect response.

The bug occurs because the _read_body function does not properly handle the chunked encoding and is not decoding the response correctly before returning it to the test function.

To fix the bug, the _read_body function should properly handle the chunked encoding and decode the response before returning it. This can be achieved by using a library function or custom logic to decode the chunked data and parse it into the expected format.

Here is the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        # handle Content-Length
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        # handle chunked encoding
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected implementation properly handles both Content-Length and chunked encoding, ensuring that the response is decoded and parsed correctly before returning it to the caller.
