At first glance, the problematic function seems to be reading the body of an HTTP response based on the headers, content length, and transfer encoding. The issue indicated by the test function error message is that the response received does not match the expected response.

The potential error within the _read_body function could be the implementation of reading the chunked body. It seems that the function is not correctly processing the chunked encoding of the response body, which leads to the mismatch in the test case.

The reason behind this bug could be that the function is not handling the chunked encoding properly and therefore not able to parse the response body correctly.

To fix the bug, the _read_body function needs to correctly handle the chunked encoding and parse the response body accordingly. This can be achieved by implementing a proper parsing mechanism for chunked encoding as per the HTTP specifications.

Here's the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks for the presence of the "Content-Length" header and determines the length of the body. If the chunked encoding is present in the headers, it calls the _read_chunked_body function to handle the chunked response. Otherwise, it falls back to reading the body until close if the connection is client-side.
