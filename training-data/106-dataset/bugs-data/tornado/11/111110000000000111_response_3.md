Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is the checking for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the response. The code raises an error if both are present, as per the HTTP protocol standards.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly checks for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the response. According to the HTTP protocol standards, a response cannot contain both headers simultaneously, as mentioned in the provided comments. Therefore, the code is correct in raising an error if both headers are present.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the code should be modified to remove the check for both headers simultaneously and raise an appropriate error message if necessary. It should adhere to the HTTP protocol standards and ensure that only one of the headers is present in the response.

Corrected Code:
```python
    def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
        if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        if "Content-Length" in headers:
            if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
                # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
                # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
                # use them but if they differ it's an error.
                pieces = re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])
                if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                    raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                        "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" %
                        headers["Content-Length"])
                headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]

            try:
                content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
            except ValueError:
                # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        else:
            content_length = None

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
