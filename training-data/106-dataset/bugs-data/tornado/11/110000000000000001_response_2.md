Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the handling of the "Content-Length" header. There are checks and transformations being applied to the "Content-Length" header, and if certain conditions are not met, an HTTPInputError is being raised.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may occur due to incorrect handling of the "Content-Length" header. There are checks for multiple unequal "Content-Length" values and non-integer "Content-Length" values. If these conditions are not properly handled, it can lead to the HTTPInputError being raised incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the "Content-Length" header is properly parsed and its value is correctly handled, including cases where it may be duplicated or non-integer.
2. Implement proper error handling for different scenarios related to the "Content-Length" header, such as multiple unequal values or non-integer values.
3. Update the logic to handle the "Content-Length" header in a way that aligns with the HTTP specifications and prevents the HTTPInputError from being raised unnecessarily.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = headers["Content-Length"]
        if "," in content_length:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
            # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
            # use them but if they differ it's an error.
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if len(set(pieces)) > 1:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
