Potential error location: The if-else conditions inside the _read_body method seem to be incorrectly handling different cases for content_length and Transfer-Encoding headers.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The handling of multiple Content-Length values separated by commas is incorrect. Instead of splitting by comma and checking for equality, the code should just take the first value if multiple values are found.
2. The code should handle the case where Content-Length is not present and Transfer-Encoding is chunked separately. It's currently using an else condition, which might not be the correct approach.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the case where multiple Content-Length values are found by just taking the first value, without checking for equality.
2. Separate the handling of cases where Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present, and also handle the case where both are absent.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length_values = headers.get_list("Content-Length")
        if len(content_length_values) > 1:  # If multiple values, take the first one
            headers["Content-Length"] = content_length_values[0]
    
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
    
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
