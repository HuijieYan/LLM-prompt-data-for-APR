The potential error in the code is that when checking if the "Content-Length" header is present in the headers, the code also checks if the "Transfer-Encoding" header is present. However, the response should not contain both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers according to the HTTP standards. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not correctly handle the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. This violates the HTTP standards and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to check for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers and raise an exception if both headers are present.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
            "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")

    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" %
                    headers["Content-Length"])
            headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
