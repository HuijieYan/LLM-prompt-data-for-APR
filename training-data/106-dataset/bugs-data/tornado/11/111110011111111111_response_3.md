The error message is indicating that the test case is failing because the expected result is `{u'foo': [u'bar']}` but the actual result is `{}`. This suggests that the function `_read_body` is not parsing the request body correctly and not populating the expected result.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that parses the chunked request body.

The bug is occurring due to an issue in parsing the chunked request body. The `_read_body` function is not correctly handling the chunked encoding which is leading to incorrect parsing of the body.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the parsing logic for chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function and ensuring that it correctly reads and processes the chunked request body.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding", "").lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

The correction includes checking for the case-insensitivity of the "Transfer-Encoding" header's value and properly handling the chunked encoding by calling the `_read_chunked_body` function when the "Transfer-Encoding" is set to "chunked".
