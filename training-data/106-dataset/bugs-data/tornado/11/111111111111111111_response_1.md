The error message indicates that the response is empty (`{}`) instead of containing the expected data (`{'foo': ['bar']}`). This implies that there is an issue with the response body processing, which is handled by the `_read_body` method in the `HTTP1Connection` class.

The potential error within the `_read_body` method is in the processing of the response body based on the headers. It seems that the method is not correctly handling chunked encoding or content length of the response body, leading to an empty response being returned.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` method does not account for chunked encoding or correctly handle the content length of the response body. As a result, it fails to read and process the response body correctly, leading to an empty response being returned.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` method should be modified to correctly handle chunked encoding and content length of the response body. It should first check for the presence of the `Transfer-Encoding` header and handle chunked encoding if present. If the `Content-Length` header is present, it should handle the response body based on the specified content length. Additionally, it should check for response code 204 and handle the implicit length of zero.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` method:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Invalid Content-Length header")
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        if content_length == 0 and code != 204:
            return None  # No body to read
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body.
        return None

    if not self.is_client:
        # For server, read until close
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)

    return None  # No way to know how to read the body
```

By making these changes, the `_read_body` method should be able to correctly handle the response body and provide the expected data in the test case.
