The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of chunked request data, which is leading to an incorrect response.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_read_body` method is not handling chunked transfer encoding properly, which is leading to incorrect decoding of the response body.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_read_body` method can properly handle chunked transfer encoding and decode the response body accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

class HTTPUtil:
    class HTTPInputError(Exception):
        pass

class YourClass:
    def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
        httputil = HTTPUtil()
        if "Content-Length" in headers:
            if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
                # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
                # Transfer-Encoding headers.
                # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
            if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
                # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
                # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
                # use them but if they differ it's an error.
                pieces = re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])
                if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                    raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                        "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" %
                        headers["Content-Length"])
                headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]

            try:
                content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
            except ValueError:
                # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        else:
            content_length = None

        if code == 204:
            # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
            # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
            # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
            if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                    content_length not in (None, 0)):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
            content_length = 0

        if content_length is not None:
            return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") and headers.get("Transfer-Encoding").lower() == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        if self.is_client:
            return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
        return None
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `Transfer-Encoding` in lowercase to ensure it can handle case-insensitive header values. Additionally, we have fixed the condition for checking if the `Transfer-Encoding` header is set to "chunked". This should fix the issue with handling chunked transfer encoding and decoding the response body correctly.
