The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. The function should determine the appropriate method for reading the response body based on these headers, but it is currently not handling the cases correctly, leading to potential errors or incorrect behavior.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers, as well as properly parsing the content length and determining the appropriate method for reading the body based on the headers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
            "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
    content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
    transfer_encoding = headers.get("Transfer-Encoding")
    
    if content_length:
        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
                
            if code == 204 and content_length != 0:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code 204 should not have body")
            
            return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Invalid Content-Length")
    elif transfer_encoding == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
