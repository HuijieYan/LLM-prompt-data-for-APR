The error message is showing that the `json_decode` function does not return the expected result. This could be due to an issue within the `_read_body` function, which processes the response body based on its content length and transfer encoding.

The bug in the code seems to be related to the handling of chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function. The function should correctly parse and read the chunked data to properly decode the response.

One potential reason for the bug could be that the `_read_chunked_body` function might not be properly implemented to handle the chunked data from the response. Additionally, there could be issues with how the `json_decode` function is used to process and decode the response data.

To fix the bug, the `_read_chunked_body` function should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it properly handles the chunked encoding and reconstructs the response data. Additionally, the way the `json_decode` function is used to decode the response data should be checked to ensure it aligns with the expected format of the response.

Here's the corrected `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        # Process the content length
        content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length", "0"))
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        if content_length == 0:
            return None  # Empty body
        
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        # Process the chunked encoding
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```

This corrected function should better handle the cases where the response body is chunked or has a specific content length. Additionally, the usage of `json_decode` should also be cross-checked to ensure it aligns with the expected response data structure.
