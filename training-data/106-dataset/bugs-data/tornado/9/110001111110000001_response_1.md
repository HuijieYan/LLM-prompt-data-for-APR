The test case "test_url_concat_none_params" is trying to call the "url_concat" function with a `None` argument, which is allowed according to the function's docstring. However, the function is raising a TypeError when it receives a `None` argument.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that checks the type of the 'args' parameter. When 'args' is None, the function should not raise an error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when 'args' is None, which should be allowed according to the function's docstring.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition at the beginning of the function to return the URL as is if 'args' is None.

Here's the corrected code for the "url_concat" function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qsl, urlencode, urlunparse

def url_concat(url, args):
    if args is None:  # If args is None, return the URL as is
        return url

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if isinstance(args, dict):
        parsed_query = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query, keep_blank_values=True)
        parsed_query.extend(args.items())
    elif isinstance(args, (list, tuple)):
        parsed_query = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query, keep_blank_values=True)
        parsed_query.extend(args)
    else:
        err = "'args' parameter should be dict, list or tuple. Not {0}".format(
            type(args))
        raise TypeError(err)

    final_query = urlencode(parsed_query)
    url = urlunparse((
        parsed_url[0],
        parsed_url[1],
        parsed_url[2],
        parsed_url[3],
        final_query,
        parsed_url[5]))
    return url
```
