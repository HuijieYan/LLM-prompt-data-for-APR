The bug is likely in the `write_headers` function itself, and it may be related to the handling of headers. It's possible that the `headers` parameter is not being processed correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because in the original function, there are a number of complex conditionals and assertions that are not properly handled. Additionally, it seems that the handling of `headers` and calculation of `self._expected_content_remaining` is incorrect in some cases. 

To fix the bug, the complex conditionals and assertions should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are being evaluated correctly. Additionally, the handling of `headers` should be checked to ensure that the correct values are being set for `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`. 

It would also be beneficial to refactor the function and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts, to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Here's a potential fix for the function:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future
from tornado.gen import future_add_done_callback
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.http1connection import HTTP1Connection
from typing import Union
import tornado.httputil
import tornado.iostream
from typing import cast

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[tornado.httputil.RequestStartLine, tornado.httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: tornado.httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    if isinstance(start_line, tornado.httputil.RequestStartLine):
        self.write_request_headers(start_line, headers)
    else:
        self.write_response_headers(start_line, headers, chunk)
    future = Future()
    IOLoop.current().add_future(future, self.handle_write)
    return future

def write_request_headers(self, start_line, headers):
    if start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH") and "Content-Length" not in headers:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
        headers.add("Connection", "close")
    self.write_headers_to_stream(start_line, headers)

def write_response_headers(self, start_line, headers, chunk):
    if start_line.code not in (204, 304) and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200):
        if "Content-Length" not in headers:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
        headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    self.write_headers_to_stream(start_line, headers, chunk)

def write_headers_to_stream(self, start_line, headers, chunk=None):
    lines = [f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} {start_line.version}"]
    lines.extend([f"{name}: {value}" for name, value in headers.get_all()])
    data = "\r\n".join(lines).encode("utf-8") + b"\r\n\r\n"
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    self.stream.write(data, self.handle_write)
```
