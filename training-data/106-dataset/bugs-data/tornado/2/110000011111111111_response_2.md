The error is most likely occurring within the `write_headers` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The error from the test case indicates that the operation timed out after 5 seconds, suggesting that the function is taking too long to execute.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the function is doing a lot of processing, including assertions, checking conditions, and generating future responses. This extensive processing may be causing the function to take a significant amount of time to complete, leading to a timeout error in the test case.

The potential reasons behind the bug could be:
1. Overly complex logic in the `write_headers` function leading to slow execution.
2. The use of assertions and unnecessary conditions that are slowing down the function.
3. Excessive use of assertions impacting the performance.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Remove unnecessary assertions and conditions to streamline the logic and improve performance.
2. Optimize the processing within the function to reduce the execution time.
3. Use logging to identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues within the function.

Here's the corrected `write_headers` function:
```python
