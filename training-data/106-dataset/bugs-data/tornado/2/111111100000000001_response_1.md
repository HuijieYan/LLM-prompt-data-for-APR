The potential error in the `write_headers` function is with the incorrect usage of the `future_add_done_callback` method. This method does not exist in the provided code, and it seems like a typo or mistake. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to use `future_add_done_callback` method to add a callback to the `pending_write` future, but this method is not defined anywhere in the provided code.

To fix this bug, we can use the `add_done_callback` method which is available for Python `Future` objects to add a callback to the `pending_write` future.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    # ... (existing code) ...
    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        self._pending_write.add_done_callback(self._on_write_complete)  # Corrected callback method
    return future
``` 

In the corrected code, we replaced `future_add_done_callback` with the correct method `add_done_callback` to add a callback to the `pending_write` future.
