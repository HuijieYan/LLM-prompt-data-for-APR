The test case is encountering a timeout error after 5 seconds, which indicates that the `fetch` method is taking too long to complete. The `fetch` method uses the `write_headers` method, so the bug might be there.

Looking at the `write_headers` method, it seems like the bug might be related to the handling of the `future` object. The future object is being instantiated and returned, but there are no callbacks or handling of the future's completion.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug might be that the future object is not properly handled or resolved within the `write_headers` method, leading to a timeout in the calling `fetch` method.

To fix the bug, the `future` object needs to be properly resolved or handled based on the outcomes of the `if-else` logic and the background operations being performed in the method.

Here's the corrected `write_headers` method:

```python
from typing import Union
from tornado.concurrent import Future

def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # omitted code...

    future = self.stream.write(b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n")
    
    if chunk:
        self.stream.write(self._format_chunk(chunk))
    future.add_done_callback(self._on_write_complete)  # Handle future completion

    return future
```
