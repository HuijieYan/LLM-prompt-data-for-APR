The bug in this case is likely related to the `write_headers` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The function seems to be failing when executing the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` due to a timeout error.

Upon analyzing the function and the provided test case, it appears that the `write_headers` function might be taking too long to execute, causing a timeout error in the test case. This could be due to inefficient or incorrect implementation of the function, leading to prolonged execution times.

To fix this bug, the `write_headers` function needs to be optimized. This could involve reviewing the implementation to ensure that it is efficient and follows best practices. Additionally, it might be necessary to optimize any I/O operations such as writing to the stream.

Here is the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union
from tornado.httputil import HTTPHeaders
from tornado.iostream import IOStream
from tornado.concurrent import Future
from tornado import httputil, iostream

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    # Other class methods...

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []

        # Other implementation details...

        future = Future()

        # Create data by concatenating lines and headers
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)

        if not self.stream.closed():
            self.stream.write(data, callback=self._on_write_complete)
        else:
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())

        return future
```

In the corrected code:
- The function immediately returns a future without waiting for asynchronous I/O operations. This allows the function to return quickly and prevents timeout errors.
- It writes to the stream without blocking the IOLoop, ensuring that it is non-blocking and efficient.

This corrected version should prevent the timeout errors and improve the efficiency of the `write_headers` function.
