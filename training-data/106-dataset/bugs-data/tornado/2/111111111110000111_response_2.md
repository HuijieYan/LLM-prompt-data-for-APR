The error message indicates a timeout occurred after 5 seconds during the `fetch` operation in the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test.

Upon analysis of the `write_headers` function, it seems that the potential error location is within the handling of the `stream` and the `write_future`. The code creates a `Future` object called `write_future` as an attribute of the instance. If the `stream` is closed, it sets an exception on the `write_future` and returns it. However, in cases where the `stream` is not closed, it sets up the data for writing to the stream and adds a callback on the `pending_write` future for `_on_write_complete` function. This process may be causing the timeout due to an issue with coordinating futures.

The bug probably occurs because the handling of the `write_future` and the `pending_write` future is not appropriately coordinated, potentially leading to a situation where the `write_future` might not be resolved correctly, causing the test to time out.

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the `write_future` and the `pending_write` are coordinated in a way that allows for proper handling of either case (stream closed or not) and resolves the `write_future` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        # ... (previous code unchanged)

        future = Future()

        def write_complete_callback(f: Future):
            if not f.exception():
                future.set_result(None)
            else:
                future.set_exception(f.exception())

        if self.stream.closed():
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(pending_write, write_complete_callback)

        return future
```

In the corrected code, a new `Future` object called `future` is created. Additionally, a `write_complete_callback` function is defined to handle the resolution of the `future` based on the result of the `pending_write` future. This ensures that the `write_future` is appropriately coordinated with the write operation on the stream.
