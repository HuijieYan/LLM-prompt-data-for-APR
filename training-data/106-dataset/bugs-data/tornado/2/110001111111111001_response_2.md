The test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` seems to be related to the error message. The test case is attempting to send a PUT request without a request body and verifying the response body. This test involves making a request with a non-standard method (PUT) and the `allow_nonstandard_methods` parameter is set to `True`.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function could be the logic for handling non-standard HTTP methods. Since the bug occurs within the `write_headers` method and not the `fetch` method, it indicates that the issue is within the HTTP handling logic.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of non-standard HTTP methods or the discrepancy between the input values and the expected behavior of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve reviewing and rectifying the logic for handling non-standard methods such as PUT. This may include ensuring that the HTTP spec for chunked requests without a body is correctly implemented.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
        content_length_present = "Content-Length" in headers
        transfer_encoding_present = "Transfer-Encoding" in headers
        self._chunking_output = (
            start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
            and not (content_length_present or transfer_encoding_present)
        )
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
        content_length_transfer_encoding_conditions = (
            start_line.code not in (204, 304) and start_line.code < 100
        )
        self._chunking_output = (
            (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and content_length_transfer_encoding_conditions
                and not content_length_present
                and not transfer_encoding_present
            )
            or (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
                and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
            )
        )
        # Handle the headers according to the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 specifications
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
            and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    if not self.is_client and (
        self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD"
        or isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        and start_line.code == 304
    ):
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None

    header_lines = (
        native_str(n) + ": " + native_str(v) for n, v in headers.get_all()
    )
    lines.extend(l.encode("latin1") for l in header_lines)
    for line in lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
    future = self.stream.write(b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n")
    self._pending_write = future
    return future
``` 

In the corrected code, the handling of non-standard HTTP methods and the functionality for checking the presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding headers has been refactored to align with the appropriate HTTP specifications. Additionally, the logic for setting the future and pending write has been modified to ensure the correct handling of asynchronous operations.

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected code to ensure it functions as expected in various scenarios.
