Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here is the full code of the fixed `write_headers` method within the `HTTP1Connection` class:

```python
from typing import Union, cast
from tornado.http1connection import HTTPConnection, RequestStartLine, ResponseStartLine, HTTPHeaders
from tornado.concurrent import Future

class HTTP1Connection(HTTPConnection):
    # ... other methods ...

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[RequestStartLine, ResponseStartLine],
        headers: HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        lines = []
        if self.is_client:
            assert isinstance(start_line, RequestStartLine)
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} HTTP/1.1")
            # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a
            # Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
            self._chunking_output = (
                start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
        else:
            assert isinstance(start_line, ResponseStartLine)
            assert self._request_start_line is not None
            assert self._request_headers is not None
            self._response_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}")
            self._chunking_output = (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
                and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
            # If connection to a 1.1 client will be closed, inform client
            if (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and self._disconnect_on_finish
            ):
                headers["Connection"] = "close"
            # If a 1.0 client asked for keep-alive, add the header.
            if (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
                and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
            ):
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"

        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

        if not self.is_client and (self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD" or cast(ResponseStartLine, start_line).code == 304):
            self._expected_content_remaining = 0
        elif "Content-Length" in headers:
            self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        else:
            self._expected_content_remaining = None

        header_lines = (f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all().items())
        lines.extend(header_lines)
        for line in lines:
            if b"\n" in line.encode():
                raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))

        future = None
        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            self._pending_write.add_done_callback(self._on_write_complete)

        return future
```

The modifications focus on ensuring correct handling of client and server specifics, correct setting of chunking output, handling content-length, transfer-encoding, and managing the asynchronous behavior using Futures and Future callbacks.
