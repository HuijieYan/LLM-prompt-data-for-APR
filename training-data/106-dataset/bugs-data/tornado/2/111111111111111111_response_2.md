The test case is attempting to send a PUT request with a redirect to the server and is expecting a response body of "Put body: ".

The bug is likely to be located in the `write_headers` method of the `HTTP1Connection` class, specifically in the construction of the data to be sent in the request.

The problematic function has complex logic involving handling different cases for client and server, managing headers, and determining the expected content length. It also has a section handling chunked encoding. An incorrect implementation in any part of this method could lead to the timeout error encountered.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully review the logic within the `write_headers` method. We need to ensure that the headers, start line, and other necessary components are being constructed properly for the PUT request with a redirect. Additionally, it's important to verify that the handling of chunked encoding and content length is consistent with the requirements.

A general approach to fixing the bug would involve carefully reviewing the logic in the `write_headers` method, addressing any inconsistencies in the construction of data, headers, and handling of chunked encoding and content length. Validation of the start line, headers, and data construction based on the input parameters is crucial. Furthermore, it's important to ensure that the correct response is being generated for a PUT request with a redirect.

Below is the corrected code based on the provided context:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []

    # ... (existing logic)

    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

    if not self.is_client and (start_line.method == "HEAD" or start_line.code == 304):
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None

    header_lines = (f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all())
    lines.extend(f"{l}" for l in header_lines)

    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = "\r\n".join(lines) + "\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += chunk.decode("utf-8")  # Assuming utf-8 encoding
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data.encode("utf-8"))  # Assuming utf-8 encoding
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```
