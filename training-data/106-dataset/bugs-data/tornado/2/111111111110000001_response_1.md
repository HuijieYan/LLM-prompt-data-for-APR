The error message indicates a timeout error when trying to fetch the response for a PUT request without a body.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function is likely related to the handling of the `future` variable that is returned at the end of the function. There might be an issue with setting and returning the `future` object, leading to a timeout error.

The bug is likely occurring because the `future` object is not being handled correctly, possibly not being set or resolved properly, leading to the timeout error when the test case tries to fetch the response.

To fix the bug, the `future` object should be instantiated at the beginning of the `write_headers` function, and its result set before being returned. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure that `future` is properly resolved when the write operation or any related asynchronous tasks are completed.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    future = Future()

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    
    return future
``` 

In the corrected code, a `Future` object is instantiated at the beginning of the function, and its result is set based on the completion of the write operation or other asynchronous tasks. This ensures that the `future` object is handled properly and should resolve the timeout error encountered in the test case.
