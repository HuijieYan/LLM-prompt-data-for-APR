The error message suggests that the `fetch` method in the test function `test_redirect_put_without_body` times out after 5 seconds. The timeout is likely related to the function being tested, specifically the `write_headers` method of `HTTP1Connection`. The timeout occurs when trying to execute the `fetch` call, which is part of testing the `write_headers` method.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` method is where it checks if the stream is closed, and if it is closed, it sets the future to `StreamClosedError` and immediately raises an exception using `future.exception()`. This might cause the function to time out when the future is set with an exception before it can be canceled, leading to the timeout error observed in the test function.

To fix the issue, the code should not immediately raise an exception when the stream is closed. Instead, it should set the exception and then allow the calling code (the `fetch` method in the test case) to handle the exception.

Here's the corrected `write_headers` method:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # ... [omitted code] ...

    future = self._write_future = Future()
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```

In this corrected code, the exception is set on the future when the stream is closed, but the function does not raise the exception immediately. This allows the calling code to handle the exception appropriately without causing a timeout.
