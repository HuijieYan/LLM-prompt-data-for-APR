The potential error in the code is likely with the handling of the headers and chunking logic. Since the code generates a list of lines for the headers and then joins them into a single byte string, it's possible that there might be an issue with the headers or the chunking logic causing incorrect data to be written to the stream.

The bug occurs due to the mishandling of the headers and the chunking logic. The logic for chunking and handling the headers is complex and prone to errors. Additionally, the code seems to be handling both client and server logic, which might be causing further confusion.

To fix this bug, it's crucial to review and simplify the logic for handling headers and chunking. Separating the logic for client and server handling might also improve the clarity and maintainability of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    lines = []
    if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(" ".join((start_line.method, start_line.path, "HTTP/1.1")).encode("utf-8"))
        self._chunking_output = (
            start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
    else:
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(" ".join(("HTTP/1.1", str(start_line.code), start_line.reason)).encode("utf-8"))
        self._chunking_output = (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
        
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and self._disconnect_on_finish
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
            and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    
    if start_line.method == "HEAD" or start_line.code == 304:
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None
    
    header_lines = (f"{name}: {value}" for name, value in headers.get_all())
    lines.extend(header_lines)
    
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    
    future = self.stream.write(data)
    return future
```
