The test case is attempting to make an HTTP request with the `PUT` method, but it is failing due to a timeout error after 5 seconds. This suggests that there might be an issue with the handling of the `PUT` method in the `write_headers` function within the `HTTP1Connection` class.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function is the handling of the `PUT` method and its associated logic for content-length, transfer encoding, and chunking output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the improper handling of the `PUT` method, content-length, or transfer encoding, which might be causing the request to time out.

To fix the bug, the `write_headers` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `PUT` method and its associated headers such as content-length and transfer encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.uri)))
        self._chunking_output = (
            start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason))
        self._chunking_output = (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n"
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    data += b"\r\n"
    self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
    future = self._write_future = Future()
    future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks for the `PUT` method and its associated headers have been modified to ensure proper handling, and the data to be written is prepared accordingly.
