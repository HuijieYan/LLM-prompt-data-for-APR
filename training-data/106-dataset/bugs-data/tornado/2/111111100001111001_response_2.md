The issue with the provided function seems to be related to the handling of chunking the output and setting up headers for an HTTP request or response. 

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of chunking output and setting the headers for the request or response. Additionally, there may be a problem with the handling of the future object and setting the pending write for the stream.

To fix the bug, make sure to correctly handle the chunking output based on the specific conditions for HTTP requests or responses. Also, ensure that the correct headers are set based on the status of the request or response. Additionally, proper handling of the future object and the pending write for the stream is necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
            self._chunking_output = start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH") and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        else:
            assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)

            assert self._request_headers is not None
            self._response_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
            self._chunking_output = self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and start_line.code not in (204, 304) and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200) and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers

            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

            self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        else:
            self._expected_content_remaining = None
        header_lines = (native_str(n) + ": " + native_str(v) for n, v in headers.get_all())
        lines.extend(l.encode("latin1") for l in header_lines)
        for line in lines:
            if b"\n" in line:
                raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
        future = None
        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        return future
