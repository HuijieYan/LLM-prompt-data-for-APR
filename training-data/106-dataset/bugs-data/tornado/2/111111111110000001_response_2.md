The error message indicates a timeout occurred when running the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body`. This test involves making a request using the `fetch` method and specifying the `allow_nonstandard_methods` argument as `True`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `write_headers` method of the `HTTP1Connection` class. It seems that the function execution is taking longer than expected, leading to a timeout.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the implementation of the `write_headers` method. It might be performing some blocking or time-consuming operations, causing the test case to time out.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include optimizing the `write_headers` function to reduce the time it takes to execute. This might involve identifying and reducing any blocking operations, implementing asynchronous behavior where possible, and ensuring efficient handling of the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` method, with some potential improvements:

```python
from typing import Union

# Define the correct return type for the method
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    # ... existing implementation ...

    # Process headers and prepare data to be written
    # ...

    # Allow asynchronous behavior by returning a Future
    future = Future()
    if self.stream.closed():
        # Handle the case when the stream is closed
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```

In this corrected version, we are ensuring that the method returns a `Future` for asynchronous behavior and handling the cases where the stream may be closed. Additionally, we have omitted the code that wasn't directly relevant to understanding the bug and its fix.
