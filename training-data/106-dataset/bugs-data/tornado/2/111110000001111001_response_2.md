The bug in the `write_headers` function seems to be related to the logic that determines the `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers.

The function first checks if `self.is_client` is `True` and then sets `self._chunking_output` based on the method of the request start line (`start_line.method`). After this, it sets the `Transfer-Encoding` header if `self._chunking_output` is `True` and then proceeds to set the `Content-Length` header if it exists in the headers. However, the setting of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers seems to be incorrect.

The reason for the bug might be that the logic for setting the `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers is not handling all edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect values being set.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle scenarios where the `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers should be set based on the HTTP protocol and the type of request (client or server).

Here is the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        # ... omitted code ...
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        # ... omitted code ...
    # Check for the presence of body and set Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding
    if "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
        else:
            # Calculate the length of the body based on chunk and set Content-Length
            if chunk:
                headers["Content-Length"] = str(len(chunk))

    # If connection to a 1.1 client will be closed, inform client
    if (
        self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
        and self._disconnect_on_finish
    ):
        headers["Connection"] = "close"
    # If a 1.0 client asked for keep-alive, add the header.
    if (
        self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
        and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
    ):
        headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"

    # ... omitted code ...

    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```

In the corrected code, I updated the logic for setting the `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers based on whether the chunking output is enabled and the presence of the body. Additionally, I've ensured that the headers are set according to the HTTP protocol version and other relevant conditions.
