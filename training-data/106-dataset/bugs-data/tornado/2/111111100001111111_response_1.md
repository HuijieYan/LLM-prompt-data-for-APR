The issue in the provided function is that it is returning a `Future` object before actually setting the result of the future. This can cause unexpected behavior in the code using this function and may lead to unhandled exceptions or incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the `Future` object should be created and returned only after setting the result or exception.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    future = Future()
    self._write_future = future
    lines = []
    # ... (omitted code)
    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```

In this corrected code, the `Future` object is created, and the result or exception is set accordingly before returning it. This ensures that the `Future` is properly handled in the calling code, and any exceptions are appropriately caught and handled.
