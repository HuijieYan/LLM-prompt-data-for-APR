The potential error in the `write_headers` function is that it is returning None instead of the expected 'Future[None]' type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not creating and returning a proper Future object.

To fix the bug, we need to create a Future object and return it at the end of the function. We also need to set the result of the Future based on the condition checks in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # ... existing code ...

    future = Future()
    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    
    return future
```
