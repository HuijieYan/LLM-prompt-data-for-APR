The error message indicates a timeout during the execution of the `fetch` function in the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body`. This suggests that the `fetch` function did not complete within the expected time frame, possibly due to an issue with the `write_headers` function.

Upon analyzing the `write_headers` function, it seems that the function may be performing correctly based on the provided variable values and expected values. However, the function's internal behavior might be causing the test case to fail, leading to the timeout error.

The potential source of the issue could be within the `self._pending_write` or `future` handling in the `write_headers` function. If the writing of the data to the stream or the completion callback is not handled correctly, it could lead to a blocking operation, resulting in a timeout in the test case.

To address this issue, it is advisable to review the manner in which the `self._pending_write` and `future` objects are handled, ensuring that they are appropriately managed to avoid any blocking operations. Additionally, verifying that the stream writing and completion callback are functioning as intended may also help resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # ... existing code ...

    future = Future()

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self.stream.write(data, self._on_write_complete, future)

    return future
```

In the corrected code, the `write` operation to the stream is handled with a completion callback (`_on_write_complete`) and a future to track the operation's completion. This approach helps prevent any blocking operations and allows for proper handling of the asynchronous write operation.
