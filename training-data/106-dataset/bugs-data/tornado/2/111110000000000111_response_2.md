Potential Error Location:
The bug might be in the handling of the "headers" parameter and its conversion into "header_lines" in the "write_headers" function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the "headers" parameter is being converted into "header_lines" without ensuring that all values are of type "str". This could result in some "bytes" slipping through, causing issues when encoding the header lines.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that all values in the "headers" parameter are converted to type "str" before being processed.
2. Remove the unnecessary conversion of "header_lines" to "bytes" and directly join and encode the lines.

Corrected Code:
