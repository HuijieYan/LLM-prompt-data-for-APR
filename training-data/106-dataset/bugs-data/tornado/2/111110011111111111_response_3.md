Based on the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` and the error message, it appears that the `fetch` method is timing out, indicating that the `write_headers` method in the `HTTP1Connection` class is taking too long to execute or is encountering an error.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` method could be related to the handling of the headers and the chunking logic, specifically in the generation of the `data` variable and the handling of the `Future` object.

The bug is likely occurring because the `write_headers` method is not handling the headers and chunking logic properly, leading to potential issues with formatting the output data and handling the completion of the write operation.

To fix the bug, the `write_headers` method should be revised to correctly handle the headers and chunking logic, ensuring that the data is formatted properly and the write operation is completed without timing out.

Here's the corrected `write_headers` method:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> 'Future[None]':
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(bytes(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} HTTP/1.1", 'utf-8'))
            self._chunking_output = (
                start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
    else:
        if isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine):
            self._response_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(bytes(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}", 'utf-8'))
            self._chunking_output = (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
                and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
                headers["Connection"] = "close"
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    if not self.is_client and (
        self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD"
        or isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine) and start_line.code == 304
    ):
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None
    header_lines = (f'{n}: {v}' for n, v in headers.get_all())
    lines.extend(header_lines)
    for line in lines:
        if b'\n' in line:
            raise ValueError(f'Newline in header: {line}')
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
    future = Future()
    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        return future
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
    future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```
