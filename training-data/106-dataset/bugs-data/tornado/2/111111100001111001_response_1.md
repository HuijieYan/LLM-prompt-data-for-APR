The buggy function `write_headers` in the class `HTTP1Connection` has a few issues. Based on the provided input and expected test cases, the function seems to be working incorrectly as it's not formatting the headers and handling the chunking output properly.

### Issues:
1. The function is not properly formatting the header lines based on the input parameters and instance variables.
2. The chunking output is not being handled properly based on the input parameters and instance variables.
3. The function does not seem to be returning the correct future instance based on the input and instance variables.

### Potential Fixes:
1. The header lines need to be formatted correctly using the input parameters `headers` and `start_line`.
2. The chunking output should be determined and handled appropriately based on the input parameters and instance variables.
3. The correct future instance should be returned based on the input parameters and instance variables.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Union

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    # ... other functions ...

    def write_headers(
            self,
            start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
            headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
            chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        
        header_lines = [f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} {start_line.version or 'HTTP/1.1'}"]
        for name, value in headers.get_all():
            header_lines.append(f"{name}: {value}")
        
        if self.is_client:
            # client-side logic
            if chunk and start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH") and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
                self._chunking_output = True
                
            if self._chunking_output:
                headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
        else:
            # server-side logic
            if start_line.code not in (204, 304) and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200) and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
                self._chunking_output = True
                
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
                headers["Connection"] = "close"
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
            if self._chunking_output:
                headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
                
        data = "\r\n".join(header_lines).encode("latin1") + b"\r\n\r\n"
        
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        if not self.stream.closed():
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
            
        return future
```

The corrected code includes proper formatting of header lines, handling of chunking output based on different scenarios, and returning the correct future instance.
