In the code for the function `write_headers` of the HTTP1Connection class, it seems that there is an error related to the `unicode` and `utf8` conversion of strings. The `utf8` function is used to convert strings to bytes and the `native_str` function is used to ensure compatibility with Python 2 and 3, but the specific error is not provided.

The potential error location is likely related to the `utf8` and `native_str` conversions, as indicated by their presence in the code and the mention of bytes slipping through. This could be causing issues with the headers and lines used in the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling of string conversions, causing issues when dealing with encoding and decoding text.

To fix the bug, the code related to string conversions and handling should be updated to ensure compatibility with Python 3 and to correctly handle the encoding/decoding of strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union
from tornado import httputil

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],

    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":

    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} HTTP/1.1".encode("utf-8"))
        # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a
        # Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
        self._chunking_output = (
            start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
            and b"Content-Length" not in headers
            and b"Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
    else:

        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}".encode("utf-8"))

            # 1xx, 204 and 304 responses have no body (not even a zero-length
            # body), and so should not have either Content-Length or
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)

        )
