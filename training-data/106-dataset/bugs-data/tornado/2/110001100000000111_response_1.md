The potential error in the problematic function is that the function is returning the 'future' variable before it is assigned the correct value in the if-else block. This means that the 'future' variable might be returned without being properly assigned a value in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the 'future' variable is being re-assigned in both the if and else blocks, but it is being returned before the re-assignment occurs.

To fix this bug, the 'future' variable should be assigned in both the if and else blocks, and then returned after the if-else block.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        # rest of the code ...

        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        
        return future
```
