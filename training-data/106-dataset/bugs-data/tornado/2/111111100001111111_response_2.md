The potential error in the `write_headers` function seems to be related to the initialization of the `future` variable. In the code, `future` is set to `None` before conditional assignments, and then it is set to an instance of `Future`. There is no need to initialize `future` to `None` before the conditional checks.

The bug occurs because the code initializes `future` as `None` and then conditionally assigns it to an instance of `Future`. This could lead to unexpected behavior, as it's possible that `future` may be used in error handling or other logic before the conditional assignment occurs.

To fix this, the code should only assign `future` to an instance of `Future` based on the conditional checks. This ensures that `future` always contains a valid instance of `Future` before being used in subsequent logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    future = None

    if self.stream.closed():
        future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```

In the fixed code, `future` is initialized to `None`, but it is then conditionally assigned based on the result of the conditional checks. This ensures that `future` always contains a valid instance of `Future` before being used in subsequent logic.
