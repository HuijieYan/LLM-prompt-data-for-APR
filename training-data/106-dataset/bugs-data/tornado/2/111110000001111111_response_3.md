The issue with the `write_headers` function is not readily apparent from the input and expected cases, but the initial analysis shows that it might be related to the headers generation and handling.

The potential error is likely to be related to the handling of headers, specifically the encoding and generation of header lines.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of headers and generation of header lines. The encoding of the headers and the construction of header lines could be incorrect, leading to the function not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the headers need to be handled correctly, ensuring that they are properly encoded and constructed into header lines. It's important to ensure that the encoding is consistent and that appropriate delimiters are used.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} HTTP/1.1".encode("utf-8"))
        # ... (other client-specific header handling)
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}".encode("utf-8"))
        # ... (other server-specific header handling)

    # Construct header lines
    for name, value in headers.get_all():
        lines.append(f"{name}: {value}".encode("utf-8"))

    # Concatenate and join header lines
    headers_bytes = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"

    # Write the header data to the stream
    future = self.stream.write(headers_bytes)
    return future
```

In the corrected code, the headers are properly encoded and constructed into header lines before being written to the stream. This should address the potential encoding and header handling issues.
