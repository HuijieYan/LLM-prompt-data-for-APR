The error message indicates that a timeout occurred after 5 seconds during the execution of the `fetch` method within the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test case. This method calls the `write_headers` function, which is likely the source of the problem.

Upon analyzing the `write_headers` function, it seems that the bug may be related to the handling of the `Future` object and the asynchronous nature of the code. There might be issues with setting and managing the `Future` object, leading to a timeout error.

The timeout error occurs because the `write_headers` function is taking longer than 5 seconds to complete, and it is not resolving the `Future` object within this timeframe.

To fix this issue, it is important to ensure that the `Future` object is properly managed and resolved within a reasonable timeframe. This could involve restructuring the asynchronous logic, handling the `Future` object more efficiently, and potentially optimizing the I/O operations within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union
import httputil
from tornado.concurrent import Future

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    future = Future()

    # ... (existing code)

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        self._pending_write.add_done_callback(self._on_write_complete)
        future = self._pending_write

    return future
```

In the corrected code, a new `Future` object is created, and it is properly managed based on the condition of whether the stream is closed or not. Additionally, the `add_done_callback` method is used to handle the completion of the asynchronous write operation.

This revised code aims to resolve the timeout issue by managing the `Future` object more effectively and ensuring that the asynchronous operations within the function are handled appropriately.
