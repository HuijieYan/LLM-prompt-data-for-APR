The issue in the buggy function is related to handling the headers and determining whether or not to use chunked encoding. Specifically, the headers are not being processed correctly and might result in the request not being formed as expected. To resolve this issue, the code needs to be corrected to ensure that the proper headers are set and encoded correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `write_headers` function based on the provided details:

```python
from tornado.http1connection import HTTPConnection
from tornado.httputil import RequestStartLine, HTTPHeaders
from tornado import Future

class HTTP1Connection(HTTPConnection):
    """
    Implements the HTTP/1.x protocol.
    
    This class can be on its own for clients, or via `HTTP1ServerConnection`
    for servers.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        lines = []
        if self.is_client:
            assert isinstance(start_line, RequestStartLine)
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(f"{utf8(start_line.method)} {utf8(start_line.path)} HTTP/1.1".encode("latin1"))
            # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a
            # Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
            self._chunking_output = (
                start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
                and "Content-Length" not in headers

            )
        else:
            assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
            assert self._request_start_line is not None
            assert self._request_headers is not None
            self._response_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}".encode("latin1"))
            self._chunking_output = (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
                and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
                headers["Connection"] = "close"
            if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
        if not self.is_client and (self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD" or start_line.code == 304):
            self._expected_content_remaining = 0
        elif "Content-Length" in headers:
            self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        else:
            self._expected_content_remaining = None
        
        lines.extend(f"{name}: {value}".encode("latin1") for (name, value) in headers.get_all())
        for line in lines:
            if b"\n" in line:
                raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
        future = None
        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        return future
```

This corrected code handles the headers and chunked encoding logic properly to ensure that the request is formed and processed as expected.

After applying the corrected function, proceed to re-run the corresponding test case, and the TimeoutError should not be encountered again. If the test case passes, the function has been successfully fixed.
