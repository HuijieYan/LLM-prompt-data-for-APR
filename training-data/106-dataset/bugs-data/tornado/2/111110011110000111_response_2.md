Sure, here is the full corrected code for the `write_headers` function in the `HTTP1Connection` class:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future  # import Future from tornado.concurrent module

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    """
    Implements the HTTP/1.x protocol.
    
    This class can be on its own for clients, or via `HTTP1ServerConnection`
    for servers.
    """

    # ... (other methods and attributes) ...

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        # ... (existing code remains the same) ...

        future = Future()  # Create a Future object

        if self.stream.closed():
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

        return future  # Return the Future object
```

In the corrected code, the `Future` class from the `tornado.concurrent` module is imported, and a proper instance of `Future` is created and returned at the end of the `write_headers` function. This ensures that the asynchronous operation is properly managed and the future object is returned correctly to the calling code.
