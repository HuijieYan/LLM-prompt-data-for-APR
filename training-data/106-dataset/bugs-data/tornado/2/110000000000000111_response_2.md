It seems like the bug in the provided function is related to the `utf8()` and `native_str()` calls. These are not standard Python functions and might be causing the issue. It's likely that these functions are meant to handle string encoding, but they are not defined in the given code.

The reason behind this bug is that the `utf8()` and `native_str()` functions are not standard Python functions, so they are causing errors. These functions might have been defined in a separate file or library that is not included in the provided code.

To fix this bug, you can simply replace the `utf8()` and `native_str()` calls with standard Python string encoding and decoding functions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
