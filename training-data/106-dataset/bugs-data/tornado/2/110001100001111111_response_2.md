Potential error location: Within the `write_headers` function, the issue appears to be in the logic related to the `Transfer-Encoding` handling and the setting of the `future` variable. It seems that the function is not handling the chunking logic and setting the future appropriately.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of chunked data and the related setting of the `future` variable. In addition, the function is not properly handling the conditionals for different cases, which results in incorrect `future` and `data` variable settings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the chunking logic to correctly handle the `Transfer-Encoding` and chunked data.
2. Ensure that the conditional statements for different cases are properly handled to set the `future` and `data` variables accordingly.

The corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union
from tornado import httputil
from tornado.concurrent import Future

class HTTP1Connection:
    # ... (other methods)

    def _format_chunk(self, chunk: bytes) -> bytes:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _on_write_complete(self, future: 'Future[None]') -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
