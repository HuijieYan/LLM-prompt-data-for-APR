The potential error in the `write_headers` function is that it is not properly handling the `chunk` parameter. The function is concatenating the `chunk` to the `data` without any formatting or processing.

This could lead to incorrect formatting of the chunk data, which could cause issues when writing the data to the stream.

To fix the bug, the `chunk` parameter should be properly processed using the `_format_chunk` method before concatenating it to the `data`.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # ... (previous code) ...
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    # ... (remaining code) ...
```
