The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the headers. The function is trying to process the headers and convert them into the appropriate format, but it is encountering issues with handling newline characters and encoding.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is using the `encode` method with the "latin1" encoding, which may not cover all the cases. Additionally, the function is trying to handle bytes and strings interchangeably, leading to inconsistency and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the headers are properly handled and encoded, and that the encoding and type consistency is maintained throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
