The error is likely occurring in the `write_headers` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The `write_headers` function is responsible for formatting and writing the headers and data of an HTTP response or request.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `self._chunking_output` variable. In some cases, it is being set to `True` when it should be `False`, and in others, it is being set to `False` when it should be `True`. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior when writing headers and data.

The inconsistency in setting `self._chunking_output` might be the reason why the test case for redirecting a PUT request without a body is failing. 

To fix the bug in the `write_headers` function, the logic for setting `self._chunking_output` should be reviewed to ensure that it is set correctly based on the HTTP method, response status code, and presence of headers such as `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding`.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
            self._chunking_output = (
                start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
    else:
        if isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine):
            assert self._request_start_line is not None
            assert self._request_headers is not None
            self._response_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
            self._chunking_output = (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
                and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
                and "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
            
            if (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
                and self._disconnect_on_finish
            ):
                headers["Connection"] = "close"
            
            if (
                self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
                and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
            ):
                headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

This revised code should address the inconsistency in setting `self._chunking_output` and ensure that it behaves as expected in different scenarios. After making these changes, the `test_redirect_put_without_body` should pass as expected.
