The error message suggests that the `initialize` method is throwing a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error is in the conditional statements within the `initialize` method that check for the existence of a current IOLoop and whether to make the current IOLoop instance.

The bug occurs because in the conditional statements, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is none, and if it is not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This is contradictory to the intention of making the current instance if it already exists.

To fix the bug, we can remove the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`. This way, if `make_current` is true, it will always make the current instance regardless if it already exists or not.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
