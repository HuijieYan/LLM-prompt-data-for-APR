The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly checks whether an IOLoop instance already exists or not. The function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it either creates a new instance or raises an error. However, the logic is flawed because if `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise an error, but it doesn't. Instead, it only raises an error if `make_current` is None.

To fix this issue, the logic of the function needs to be revised to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the function first retrieves the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and then checks the condition based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is None, it creates a new instance only if there is no current instance. If `make_current` is True, it raises an error if a current instance already exists, otherwise it creates a new instance.
