The test_force_current function is trying to create an IOLoop instance with make_current set to True, and then it asserts that the current IOLoop is indeed the one that was created. However, the test is failing with a RuntimeError indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the initialize function is the "elif make_current" block. This block is checking if make_current is True and if there is no current IOLoop instance, then it calls self.make_current(). However, if there is a current IOLoop instance, it raises a RuntimeError.

The reason behind the bug is that the condition "if make_current" is always evaluating to True, even when make_current is None. This is because in Python, None evaluates to False, and any other value (including True) evaluates to True. So the condition "elif make_current" is always true, even when make_current is None.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to specifically check if make_current is True.

Here's the corrected code for the initialize function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # specifically checking if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
By making this change, the condition "if make_current is True" will only be true when make_current is explicitly set to True, and the RuntimeError will not be raised when make_current is None.
