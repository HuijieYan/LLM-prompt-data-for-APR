The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` as the current instance when it is initialized. However, there are some issues in the current implementation.

The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, where the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` is flawed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditions for setting the current `IOLoop` are not properly handled, especially when `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. If `make_current` is `None`, then the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, then it should make it the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, then the function should first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and then either raise an error if it already exists, or make it the current instance.
3. In both cases, the function should handle the scenario when `make_current` is `False`, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Get the current IOLoop instance

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()  # Make the current IOLoop instance
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Make the current IOLoop instance
```
