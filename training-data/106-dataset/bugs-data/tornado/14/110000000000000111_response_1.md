Potential error location: The potential error lies in the conditional statements for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raising a RuntimeError.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The conditional statements are not properly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. Also, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is not consistent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. When `make_current` is None, check if the IOLoop instance is already created and make it current if it's not.
2. When `make_current` is True, check if the IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, raise a RuntimeError. If it doesn't exist, make it current.

Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
