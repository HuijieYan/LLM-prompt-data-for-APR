The test case 'test_force_current' is attempting to create an instance of the IOLoop class with the parameter 'make_current' set to True. The expected behavior is that if a current IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise a RuntimeError.

The potential error location is in the 'initialize' method of the IOLoop class, specifically in the conditional block where it checks if 'make_current' is True.

The bug occurs because in the conditional block for 'make_current=True', it is checking whether the current IOLoop instance is 'None'. If it is not 'None', it should raise a RuntimeError, but instead, it attempts to make the current IOLoop instance, and if it is already the current instance, a RuntimeError is not raised.

To fix this bug, the conditional block for 'make_current=True' should be modified to first check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the 'self' current.

Here's the corrected code for the 'initialize' method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that if 'make_current' is True, it first checks whether a current IOLoop instance already exists and raises a RuntimeError if it does, before attempting to make 'self' the current instance.
