The issue appears to be with the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function checks the `make_current` parameter and then calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to determine if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If there isn't, it calls `self.make_current()`.

The bug occurs because the logic for checking if a current instance exists is incorrect. In the if statement, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the next elif statement, it again checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and if not, it raises a RuntimeError.

This means that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it will call `self.make_current()`. But in the elif statement, it then raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is contradictory and causes confusion.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking if a current instance exists should be unified and consistent.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is stored in the `current_instance` variable, and this variable is then used consistently in both if and elif statements. This ensures that the logic for checking if a current instance exists is consistent and avoids the contradictory behavior.
