The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The bug is triggered when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised.

The issue occurs because the `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly. The intention of the `make_current` parameter is to force the IOLoop to become the current IOLoop, but the current logic only checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists, and if so, raises an error. However, the logic should instead set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop if there isn't already one, and raise an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`.

To fix this issue, the logic inside the `initialize` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop if there isn't already one, and raise an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`.
