The potential error in the `initialize` function is that it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the logic seems to be inverted, as it is checking if the IOLoop current instance is None and then trying to make it current or raising an error. This is contradictory and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is True, and if so, make the IOLoop current. If `make_current` is None, then we can simply check if the IOLoop current instance is None and make it current if it is.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrects the logic so that it checks if the IOLoop current instance is None and makes it current if needed, and also raises an error if `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
