The bug in the function `initialize` is that it incorrectly handles the `make_current` parameter. The issue occurs when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it still raises a RuntimeError claiming that the current IOLoop already exists.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. We need to check if `make_current` is True and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, then we should not raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return  # Return if the IOLoop instance already exists
        self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that the RuntimeError is not raised when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
