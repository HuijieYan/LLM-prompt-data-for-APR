Potential Error Location: The potential error in the buggy function lies in the initialization check for the current IOLoop instance. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the check for the current IOLoop instance is not correctly implemented. The condition to check if the IOLoop is already current is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check if the make_current parameter is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, then make it current.
2. If the make_current parameter is None and the current IOLoop instance does not exist, then make it current.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
