The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the `if make_current is None` condition. The function is trying to call `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` which does not exist in the function. The actual function that should be called is `current(instance=False)`.

The bug occurred because the function is trying to call a non-existent function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of calling `current(instance=False)`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function calls to use the correct function name. 

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
