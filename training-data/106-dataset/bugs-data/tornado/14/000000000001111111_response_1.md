The issue occurs at line 252 of the "ioloop.py" file where the `initialize` function is checking whether the current IOLoop instance is None or not. 

The reason for the bug is that the `make_current` attribute is not used as intended. When `make_current` is None, it should call `self.make_current()` only if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also None. When `make_current` is True, it should raise a RuntimeError if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, otherwise, it should call `self.make_current()`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly account for the different scenarios based on the value of `make_current` and the current IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected function, the `make_current` attribute is checked as intended, and the logic for creating and checking the current IOLoop instance is handled properly.
