The error occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function checks the value of `make_current` and calls `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` accordingly. However, there is a logical error in the `initialize` function that causes the "already exists" error to be raised incorrectly. 

The issue occurs because the `initialize` function first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, later in the function, it checks the same condition again and raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This doesn't make sense because the condition is already checked before the error is raised, so it should not raise the error in this case.

To fix this bug, we should remove the redundant check and only raise the error if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is True, and if so, it will raise an error only if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. Otherwise, if `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it will call `self.make_current()`.
