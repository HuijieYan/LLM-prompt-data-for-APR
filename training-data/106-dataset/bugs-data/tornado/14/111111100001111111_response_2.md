The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is `True`, the method checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior contradicts the condition, causing confusion.

The reason behind the bug is the contradictory logic in the condition. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current instance exists and then make the current instance. However, the current implementation checks if the current instance does not exist and then raises a `RuntimeError`. This is not the expected behavior and can lead to confusion for developers.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should be updated to have a consistent and logical condition that accurately represents the intention. Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, when `make_current` is `True`, the method first checks if the current instance exists and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. This updated logic is consistent and aligns with the expected behavior, resolving the bug and preventing confusion.
