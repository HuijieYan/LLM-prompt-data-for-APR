1. The test case is trying to create an instance of IOLoop with `make_current` set to `True`. Then it checks if the current IOLoop is the same as the one created. It also checks if a second construction attempt with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`. Finally, it checks if the `current()` method was not affected by the failed construction.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is in the `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` blocks, where it checks if the current IOLoop exists and should be made current.

3. The error occurs because the logic to check if the IOLoop instance already exists or is None is incorrect. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` only if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value, indicating that the IOLoop already exists.

4. To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected. It should check if `make_current` is `True` and if the current IOLoop exists. If it does, then raise a `RuntimeError`. If it doesn't exist, then make the current IOLoop.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
