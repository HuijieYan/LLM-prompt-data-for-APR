The potential error location in the `initialize` function is the conditional statements where it checks the value of `make_current`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` may not be returning the expected result, causing the conditional statements to behave incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to directly check the value of `make_current` and handle the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if make_current or IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we directly check the value of `make_current` and handle the logic accordingly without relying on the `IOLoop.current` function to determine the flow. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected regardless of the return value of `IOLoop.current`.
