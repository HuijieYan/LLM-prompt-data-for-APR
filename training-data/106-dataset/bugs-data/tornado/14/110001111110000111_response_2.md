1. The test case is creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the test case is failing with a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional check for whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists. 

3. The bug occurs because the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It is checking if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and then either creating the current `IOLoop` instance or raising a `RuntimeError`. However, this logic is flawed because it should properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and handle the conditions accordingly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to properly determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is modified to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, which correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before deciding to raise a `RuntimeError` or proceed with setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
