Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that if the `make_current` parameter is not None and is evaluated as True, then the function will check if an IOLoop already exists and raise a RuntimeError if it does. However, if `make_current` is None, then it will call `self.make_current()`. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because if `make_current` is None, the function should not check for the existence of an IOLoop and directly call `self.make_current()`.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to directly call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is None, without checking for the existence of an IOLoop. If `make_current` is True, then we will check for the existence of an IOLoop and raise a RuntimeError if it already exists.

Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()  # direct call to make_current if make_current is None
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # check for IOLoop existence only if make_current is True
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
