The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is occurring at `prefix[-2:]` inside the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` package. This suggests that the `prefix` variable is being treated as an integer instead of a string, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to subscript it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `tenumerate` method, specifically in the `else` block where `enumerate` is being returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `enumerate` function call within the `else` block is being passed incorrect parameters (`start` and `iterable`). This is causing the `prefix` variable to be of incorrect type and leading to the `TypeError` in the `format_meter` method.

To fix the bug, the `enumerate` function call within the `else` block should be replaced with a call to `tqdm_class`, passing the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `tenumerate` method:

```python
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, tqdm_class=tqdm_auto, **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tqdm_class  : [default: tqdm.auto.tqdm].
    """
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
            return tqdm_class(np.ndenumerate(iterable), total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    return tqdm_class(enumerate(iterable, start), total=total, **tqdm_kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, `enumerate` has been replaced with a call to `tqdm_class` while passing the `start` and `total` parameters. This change ensures that the correct parameters are passed to `tqdm_class`, resolving the bug.
