The error message indicates a TypeError in the function `format_meter`. The specific error is occurring in a line where it is trying to check if the last two characters of a string is ": ".

The potential error location is identified within the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` library.

The bug occurred due to a mismatch in types. The variable `prefix` is expected to be a string, but it seems to be an integer which cannot be used with subscript notation.

To fix the bug, it's important to make sure that the `prefix` variable is always a string type before trying to access its last two characters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, tqdm_class=tqdm_auto,
               **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tqdm_class  : [default: tqdm.auto.tqdm].
    """
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
            return tqdm_class(np.ndenumerate(iterable),
                              total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    return enumerate(tqdm_class(iterable, start, **tqdm_kwargs))
```
