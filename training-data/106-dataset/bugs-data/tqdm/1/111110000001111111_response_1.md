The problematic function `tenumerate` is designed to work in conjunction with `tqdm` to provide a progress bar for iterating over an iterable. The issue is with the logic inside the function, where it is trying to handle numpy arrays using `np.ndenumerate` and other iterables using the built-in `enumerate` function. The logic is complicated and not handling all edge cases properly, resulting in potential type errors.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the iterable input properly. The function is trying to be smart and use `np.ndenumerate` for numpy arrays and `enumerate` for other iterables, but it's not doing it correctly.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be simplified and handle the cases more clearly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tqdm_class  : [default: tqdm.auto.tqdm].
    """
    if hasattr(iterable, '__len__'):
        total = total or len(iterable)
    return enumerate(tqdm(iterable, start=start, total=total, **tqdm_kwargs))
```

In this correction, we have removed the conditional logic for handling numpy arrays and simplified it to always use `enumerate` in conjunction with `tqdm`. We also made sure to update the progress bar total value based on the length of the iterable. This should handle all cases correctly and prevent type errors.
