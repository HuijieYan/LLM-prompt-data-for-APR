Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `try` block where the `numpy` library is imported. The function is attempting to handle `numpy` arrays, but it seems that the code is not handling the case where `numpy` is not successfully imported correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the case where `numpy` is not successfully imported. This leads to the function not behaving as expected when dealing with `numpy` arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can handle the case where `numpy` is not successfully imported by using a conditional check before trying to use `numpy` functions. If `numpy` is not successfully imported, the function should continue with the regular `enumerate` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, tqdm_class=tqdm_auto,
               **tqdm_kwargs):
    
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        np = None

    if np is not None and isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
        return tqdm_class(np.ndenumerate(iterable),
                          total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    else:
        return enumerate(tqdm_class(iterable, start, **tqdm_kwargs))
```
