The error occurs when the `total` value is `None` and the code attempts to multiply it by `unit_scale` in the `format_meter` function. This results in a `TypeError` because `total` is of type `NoneType` and can't be multiplied by an integer.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication. If it is `None`, we can set `total` to a default value like `0`.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # rest of the code...
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `total` is not `None`. If it is not `None`, we proceed with the rest of the calculations. Otherwise, we set `total` to 0 to avoid the multiplication error.
