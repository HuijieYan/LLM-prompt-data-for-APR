The error is occurring in the `format_meter` function when it tries to multiply `total` with `unit_scale`. The immediate cause of the error is that `total` is set to `None` in the function and cannot be used in numerical operations.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is `None` separately. When `total` is `None`, we can directly return the progress statistics without performing any calculations related to the progress bar.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    
    ... (parameter description omitted for brevity) ...
    """

    # If total is None, return progress statistics without progress bar
    if total is None:
        return "" if not prefix else "{}: {}{} [{}, {}{}]".format(
            prefix, n, unit, format_interval(elapsed), rate_fmt, postfix)
    
    # rest of the function
    # ...
```

By handling the case where `total` is `None`, we can avoid the TypeError and ensure that the function can handle different scenarios correctly.
