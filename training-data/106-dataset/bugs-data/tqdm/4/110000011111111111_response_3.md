The error occurs in the `format_meter` function due to the line `total *= unit_scale`. The error message indicates that the multiplication operation is being performed between a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the value of `total` is `None` in the provided test case, and when trying to perform the multiplication operation with `unit_scale`, the code encounters the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `total` is `None`. If `total` is `None`, we will not perform the multiplication operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None:  # Only perform the multiplication when total is not None
        if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
            total *= unit_scale
            n *= unit_scale
            if rate:
                rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
            unit_scale = False

    if total is not None:
        format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
        elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        ...
    else:
        return ((prefix + ": ") if prefix else '') + \
            '{0}{1} [{2}, {3}{4}]'.format(
                n, unit, elapsed_str, rate, postfix)
```

This modification ensures that the multiplication operation is only performed when `total` is not `None`.
