The error occurs because the function is trying to perform a multiplication operation on the `total` variable, which is initialized as `None`. This is caused by the logic inside the function to check `if total and n > total`. When `total` is `None`, it results in a TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation with `unit_scale`.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to handle the case when `total` is `None` and avoid the multiplication operation in that scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `format_meter`:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if `total` is not `None` before performing any operations with it. This avoids the TypeError that was occurring previously.
