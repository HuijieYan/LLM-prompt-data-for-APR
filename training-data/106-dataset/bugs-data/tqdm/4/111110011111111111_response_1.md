The potential error location within the code is the calculation of `total *= unit_scale` in the `format_meter` function. The error occurs because the `total` variable is set to `None` when the `total` and `n` values are compared and `n` is greater than `total`. This comparison leads to the incorrect assumption that `total` is meaningless, which then sets `total` to `None`. This causes the TypeError when attempting to multiply `total` by `unit_scale`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is `None` separately before performing the multiplication. We can introduce a conditional check to ensure that `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication.

The corrected `format_meter` function is as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the conditional checks for `total` being not `None`, we prevent the multiplication error, and the function will work as intended for the given test cases.
