The potential error within the problematic function `format_meter` occurs due to a mix of relative and static method declaration within the `tqdm` class. The function is not able to access the relative methods `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` correctly due to the incorrect method declaration.

To fix this bug, the staticmethod decorator needs to be removed from the function `format_func`. Instead, the method should be declared as a regular instance method to access other methods within the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(self, n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By removing the staticmethod decorator and including `self` as the first argument to the `format_meter` function, it would allow the function to access other instance methods within the class correctly.
