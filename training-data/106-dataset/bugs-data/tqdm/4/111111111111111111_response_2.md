The error occurs when the function tries to apply the custom scale (`unit_scale`) to the `total` variable, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *=: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. This happens because when the `total` is meaningless, it is assigned as `None` during the sanity check, and it cannot be multiplied by the `unit_scale`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `total` is `None`. We can use an if-else condition to check if `total` is not None before applying the custom scale.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:  # Only apply scale if total is not None
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the `total` is not `None`, and only then apply the custom scale. This change should prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to work correctly in the cases where `total` is `None`.
