The potential bug in the provided code is related to the `unit_scale` variable being used as an integer (`10`) instead of a boolean (`True` or `False`). This causes an issue when the code tries to multiply the `total` and `n` by `unit_scale` as an integer. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect calculations.

To fix this issue, the `unit_scale` variable should be set as a boolean (`True`) instead of an integer (`10`). If a scaling factor is needed, it should be applied to `total` and `n` before calling the `format_meter` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    if unit_scale:
        total = total * unit_scale
        n = n * unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate = rate * unit_scale
    
    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This change ensures that the `unit_scale` variable is used as a boolean and any scaling is applied before passing the parameters to the `format_meter` function.
