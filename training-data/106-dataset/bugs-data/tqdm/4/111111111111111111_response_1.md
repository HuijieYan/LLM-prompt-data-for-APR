The error occurs at the line `total *= unit_scale` in the function `format_meter` as shown in the error message. The reason for the bug is that the `total` variable is not initialized and remains as `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when the multiplication operation is attempted with `unit_scale`.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the `total` variable to 0 if it is `None`, before performing any operations with it.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)
    """

    # Initialize total to 0 if it's None
    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

By initializing `total` to 0 if it's `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and ensure that the `total` variable is properly handled in the subsequent calculations.
