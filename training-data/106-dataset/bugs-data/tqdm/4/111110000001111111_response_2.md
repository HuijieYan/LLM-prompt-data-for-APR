The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the calculation of the `rate` and `inv_rate` variables. 

In Buggy case 1, the `rate` is calculated as `n / elapsed` which is `0 / 0`, resulting in a division by zero and hence a potential bug.

In Buggy case 2, there doesn't seem to be a direct issue with the rate calculation.

To fix the bug, we should add a conditional check to handle the case where `elapsed` is zero, avoiding the division by zero error.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """
  
    if elapsed == 0:
        rate = float('inf')  # elapsed is 0, so setting rate to infinity
    else:
        rate = n / elapsed

    # remaining code remains the same
```
