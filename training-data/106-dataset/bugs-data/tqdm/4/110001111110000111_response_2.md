The error is occurring within the `format_meter` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by attempting to use the `*= operator on a NoneType and an int. This occurs within the portion of the code where it attempts to apply custom scale to the total if necessary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `total` variable could be None in certain cases, and hence, cannot be multiplied. This leads to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check if `total` is not None before trying to apply the custom scale. If `total` is None, we can keep it as None; otherwise, we can proceed with applying the custom scale.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and total is not None:
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This modification ensures that the `total` variable is checked for None before applying the custom scale, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring due to multiplication with a NoneType.
