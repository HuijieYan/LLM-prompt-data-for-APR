The error occurs because the variable `total` is initially set to `None`, and when the `unit_scale` is not `True` or `1`, the function tries to multiply `total` with `unit_scale`, resulting in a TypeError due to the operand types being incompatible (`NoneType` and `int`).

To fix this bug, we can set a default value for `total` in case it is `None` before performing the multiplication with `unit_scale`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format='{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}',
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # Set default value for total if it is None
    total = total if total is not None else 0
    
    # rest of the function remains the same...
```

By setting a default value for `total` as 0 if it is `None`, the function can properly handle the multiplication with `unit_scale` without raising a TypeError.
