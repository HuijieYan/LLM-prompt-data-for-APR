The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to perform the operation `total *= unit_scale`, but `total` is initially set to `None` at the beginning of the function. This is causing a TypeError when trying to multiply `None` with an integer.

Here's the corrected function with the issue fixed:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    # ... (other methods)

    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

        if total is not None and n > total:  # Changed 'total and n' to 'total is not None and n'
            total = None

        # rest of the function remains the same
```

With this correction, the function will not attempt to perform the operation if `total` is `None`, avoiding the TypeError.
