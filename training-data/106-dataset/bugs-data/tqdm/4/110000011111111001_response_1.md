The error message indicates a TypeError caused by using the *= operator with a NoneType and an int. This helps identify the potential error location in the "format_meter" method of the provided code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "total" variable is assigned the value of None under certain conditions, and then the code attempts to perform the operation "total *= unit_scale", which leads to a TypeError since "total" is None.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that "total" is not None before performing the multiplication. Additionally, we can consider using a different approach for handling "total" in cases where it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the "format_meter" method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1) and total is not None:
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that "total" is not None before performing the multiplication with "unit_scale". If "total" is None, the multiplication is skipped, preventing the TypeError.
