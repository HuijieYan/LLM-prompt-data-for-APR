The bug in the provided function `format_meter` is due to the division by 0 error. 

The error occurs because the runtime value of `rate` becomes 0 in the second buggy case, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `inv_rate`. This error occurs because the value of `rate` is calculated using `n` and `elapsed`, and in the second buggy case, `elapsed` is very small, causing `rate` to become 0.

To fix this bug, a conditional check for `rate` should be added before calculating `inv_rate` and `rate_fmt`. If `rate` is 0, then set `inv_rate` to None and `rate_fmt` to '?'.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                    unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                    postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (omitted comments) ...
    """
    
    # remaining code remains the same
    
    # if unspecified, attempt to use rate = average speed
    # (we allow manual override since predicting time is an arcane art)
    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed
    inv_rate = 1 / rate if rate else None
    
    if rate != 0:
        format_sizeof = tqdm.format_sizeof
        rate_noinv_fmt = (format_sizeof(rate) if unit_scale else
                          '{0:5.2f}'.format(rate)) + unit + '/s'
        rate_inv_fmt = ((format_sizeof(inv_rate) if unit_scale else
                         '{0:5.2f}'.format(inv_rate))
                        if inv_rate else '?') + 's/' + unit
        rate_fmt = rate_inv_fmt if inv_rate and inv_rate > 1 else rate_noinv_fmt
    else:
        inv_rate = None
        rate_fmt = '?'
    
    # remaining code remains the same
```

By adding a conditional check for the value of `rate` before calculating `inv_rate` and `rate_fmt`, we prevent the division by zero error and handle the rate value being 0 appropriately.
