The function `format_meter` is meant to return a string-based progress bar given certain parameters, including the number of finished iterations `n`, the expected total number of iterations `total`, the number of seconds passed since the start `elapsed`, and other optional parameters. However, this function seems to contain several errors.

Based on the provided input values, it seems that when `n=0`, the calculations are not considering the `unit_scale` parameter correctly, which leads to inconsistencies in the output values. It can also be observed that the function is incorrectly computing the `rate` and `inv_rate` based on the input parameters.

To fix this function:
1. The unit scaling should be correctly applied when calculating the `total` and `n` based on the `unit_scale` parameter.
2. The calculation of `rate` should be amended to ensure that it reflects the actual iteration rate considering the elapsed time and number of finished iterations.
3. Additionally, it's important to address the formatting issues in the return statements where parts of the progress bar are formatted and combined.

The corrected function for `format_meter` is as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # rest of the code remains the same as mentioned in the original buggy function

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)
    
    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed
    inv_rate = 1 / rate if rate else None
    rate_fmt = (f"{rate:.2f}" if rate else '?') + unit + '/s'

    if unit_scale:
        n_fmt = format_sizeof(n, divisor=unit_divisor)
        total_fmt = format_sizeof(total, divisor=unit_divisor) if total else 'None'
    else:
        n_fmt = str(n)
        total_fmt = str(total) if total else 'None'

    postfix = ', ' + postfix if postfix else ''

    if total:
        percentage = n / total * 100
        remaining = (total - n) / rate if rate else 0
        remaining_str = format_interval(remaining) if rate else '?'
        
        # rest of the code remains the same as mentioned in the original buggy function
    else:
        return ((prefix + ": ") if prefix else '') + '{0}{1} [{2}, {3}{4}]'.format(
            n_fmt, unit, elapsed_str, rate_fmt, postfix)
```
