The error message is a TypeError, specifically unsupported operand types for the *= operation between a NoneType and an int. This occurs when trying to apply the unit_scale value to the total variable within the format_meter function.

The bug occurs because the total variable is being checked for truthiness and set to None if n > total, and then later on, it's being operated on assuming it's a numeric type.

To fix the error, the total variable needs to be reassigned based on the unit_scale value before any operations are performed on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (other docstring comments)

    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # (other code)
```
