The potential error in the provided function is related to the way it handles different types of iterables to determine their length. The code currently checks if the iterable has a "shape" attribute, but it does not handle other types of iterables properly.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that the iterable must have a "shape" attribute, which is not the case for all types of iterables. This can lead to a AttributeError when trying to access the "shape" attribute of an iterable that does not have it.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the iterable has a "__len__" attribute, and if not, fall back to using the "len" function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
