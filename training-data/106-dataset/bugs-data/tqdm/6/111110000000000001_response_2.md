Potential Error Location: The error might be in the return statement of the __len__ function, specifically in the conditional check for the length of the iterable.

Reason for the Bug: The current implementation of the __len__ function does not handle all possible cases for getting the length of the iterable. It only covers cases where the iterable has a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute, but it does not handle the case where the iterable does not have these attributes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the iterable is None first, and if it is, return the total value.
2. If the iterable is not None, then check if it has a "shape" attribute, and if it does, return the length of the shape.
3. If it does not have a "shape" attribute, check if it has a "__len__" attribute, and if it does, return the length using that attribute.
4. If it does not have either attribute, return the total value.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ function:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return len(self.iterable.shape)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total
```
