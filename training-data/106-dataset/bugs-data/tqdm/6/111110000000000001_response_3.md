Potential error: The problematic part of the code is the return statement in the __len__ function. It seems like the intent is to return the length of the iterable if it has a shape attribute, otherwise just return the total.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the 'shape' attribute of the iterable without checking if it exists, leading to potential AttributeError. Additionally, the code is using multiple 'if' conditions without any 'else' condition which may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking if the 'shape' attribute exists and return the length accordingly. If 'shape' exists, return self.iterable.shape[0], else use hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") to check if the iterable has a length and return the length. If neither condition is met, return self.total.

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
