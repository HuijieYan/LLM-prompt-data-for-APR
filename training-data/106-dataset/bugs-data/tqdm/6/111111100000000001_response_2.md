The potential error in the given code is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The purpose of this method is to return the length of the iterable object.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.iterable` is not `None` and does not have a `shape` attribute, nor a `__len__` attribute. This causes the method to return `self.total`, which may not be the correct length of the iterable.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to first check if `self.iterable` is not `None` and has a `__len__` attribute. If it does, we should return `len(self.iterable)`. If it doesn't, we can then check if `self.iterable` has a `shape` attribute and return `self.iterable.shape[0]` if it does. If neither of these conditions are met, we can just return `self.total`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
    return self.total
```
