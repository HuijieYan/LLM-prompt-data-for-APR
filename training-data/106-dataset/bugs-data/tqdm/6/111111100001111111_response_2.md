The error message 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total' is likely related to the `self.total` attribute being accessed in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, it seems that the `total` attribute is not being initialized properly or is missing from the `tqdm` object, leading to the "no attribute 'total'" error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to check if `self.total` exists before accessing it. If it doesn't exist, we can fall back to other methods such as checking the length of the iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0  # or any other appropriate handling for cases where length cannot be determined
```

This corrected code checks if the `total` attribute exists before accessing it, and falls back to other methods to determine the length of the iterable if `total` is not available.
