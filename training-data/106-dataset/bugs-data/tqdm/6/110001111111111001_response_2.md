The error message mentions an AttributeError with the message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'". This suggests that the 'total' attribute is missing in the tqdm object, which leads to the error when the __len__ method is called.

The potential error location is within the __len__ method of the tqdm object.

The error occurs because the __len__ method tries to access the 'total' attribute of the tqdm object without checking if it exists. This causes an AttributeError when the attribute is not present.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the 'total' attribute exists before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total 
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
With this correction, the __len__ method first checks if the 'total' attribute exists and returns it. If not, it checks for other potential attributes ('shape' and '__len__') and returns their lengths if they exist. If none of these conditions are met, it returns the 'total' attribute as a fallback.
