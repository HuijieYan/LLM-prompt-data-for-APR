1. The test case provided is using the tqdm progress bar with the multiprocessing Pool and setting the `disable` parameter to True. This is causing the error 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__len__` method where it is trying to access the `total` attribute without checking if it exists.

3. The bug occurs because the `__len__` method is directly trying to access the `total` attribute without checking if it exists, leading to the error when the `disable` parameter is set to True.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to check if the `total` attribute exists before accessing it, and return the length of the iterable if it does not exist.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        if self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
                return self.iterable.shape[0]
            elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
        return 0
```
