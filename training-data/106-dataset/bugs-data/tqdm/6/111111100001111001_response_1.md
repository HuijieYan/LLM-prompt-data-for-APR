The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when `self.iterable` is `None` and does not have a defined length. This can cause an error when trying to access the length of `self.iterable`.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.iterable` is `None` before checking its length. If it is `None`, we can return `self.total`. If it is not `None`, then we can check if it has a shape attribute, and if so, return the length of its shape. If it doesn't have a shape attribute, we can check if it has a defined length and return it. If it doesn't have a defined length, we can return `self.total`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total
```
