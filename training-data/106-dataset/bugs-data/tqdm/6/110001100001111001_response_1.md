Potential error location: The `__len__` method is using a ternary operator to calculate the length of the iterable, but the logic is incorrect.

Reason for bug: The current logic is incorrect as it does not properly handle the case where `self.iterable` is not `None` but does not have a `shape` attribute or a `__len__` attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a try-except block to handle the cases where `self.iterable` does not have a `shape` attribute or a `__len__` attribute.
2. Use the `len` function directly on `self.iterable` and handle the potential exceptions.

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        try:
            return len(self.iterable)
        except:
            return self.total
```
