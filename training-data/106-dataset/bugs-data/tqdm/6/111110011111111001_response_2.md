Potential error location: The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the 'total' attribute within the __len__ method of the tqdm class.

Reasons behind the bug: The error occurs because the __len__ method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the tqdm object, which is not available.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the 'total' attribute is available before trying to access it.
2. If the 'total' attribute is not available, handle the situation accordingly by checking the type of the iterable and returning its length.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is None:
        return 0
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
