1. The test case is attempting to use the `tqdm` library to track the progress of a `multiprocessing.Pool` `imap` function. The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object has no attribute `total`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__len__` method.

3. The error occurs because the `__len__` method is trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object when it does not exist.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the `iterable` attribute is not `None` and if it has a `shape` attribute. If it does, we can return the `shape[0]`. If not, we can fall back to checking if the `iterable` has a `__len__` attribute and return its length. If neither condition is true, we can return the `total` attribute.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
