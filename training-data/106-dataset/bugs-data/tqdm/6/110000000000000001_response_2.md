The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to handle different types of iterables in a single line without proper conditional checks. This can lead to incorrect behavior and unexpected results.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to determine the length of the iterable by checking if it has a "shape" attribute, if it has a "__len__" attribute, or by returning the value of "total". However, the logic is not well-structured and doesn't handle all cases properly, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to use proper conditional checks to determine the length of the iterable. We can check if the iterable has a "shape" attribute and return the length accordingly. If it doesn't have a "shape" attribute, we can check if it has a "__len__" attribute and return its length. If none of these conditions are met, we can return the value of "total".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
