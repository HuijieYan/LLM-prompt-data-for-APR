Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the 'tqdm' library when the 'disable' argument is set to True in combination with multiprocessing.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely happening because the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute called 'total', which is being accessed in the buggy function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fixing the bug is to check if the 'self.total' attribute exists before attempting to access it in the function. Additionally, a more robust approach would be to handle the different cases where 'self.iterable' could be a NumPy array or a regular iterable, and calculate the length accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'self.total' attribute exists, and if it does, we return it. Then we check if 'self.iterable' has a 'shape' attribute and return its length. If not, we check if 'self.iterable' has a '__len__' attribute and return its length. If none of these conditions are met, we return 0 as a default value. This ensures that the function will handle different types of iterables and return the correct length.
