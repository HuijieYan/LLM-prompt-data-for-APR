Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the nested conditional statements that check if the "iterable" object has a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute. 

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the original code does not properly handle the cases when the "iterable" object does not have a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute. As a result, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to properly handle the cases when the "iterable" object does not have a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute. We can also simplify the code for better readability.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
