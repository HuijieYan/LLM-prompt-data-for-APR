1. The test case `test_imap` uses the `tqdm` library to track the progress of a task running in a multiprocessing `Pool`. The `disable=True` argument is passed to the `tqdm` function, indicating that the progress bar should not be displayed. However, this causes an error related to the `total` attribute not being found in the `tqdm` object.

2. The potential error location within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class is where the `total` attribute is being accessed.

3. The error occurs because the `total` attribute is being accessed without proper checking. It assumes that the `total` attribute exists in all cases, which is not true when the progress bar is disabled.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to handle the case where the progress bar is disabled and the `total` attribute is not available. This could involve checking if the progress bar is disabled, and if so, returning the length of the iterable (if available) or a default value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Tqdm:
    def __init__(self, iterable, total=None):
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.total = total

    def __len__(self):
        if self.total is not None:
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
                return self.iterable.shape[0]
            elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
        return 0  # default value if total and iterable are not available
```

In this corrected code, the `__len__` method checks if the `total` attribute is available, and if not, it checks for the length of the iterable or returns a default value of 0 if neither `total` nor the iterable length is available. This approach handles the case where the progress bar is disabled and the `total` attribute is not present.
