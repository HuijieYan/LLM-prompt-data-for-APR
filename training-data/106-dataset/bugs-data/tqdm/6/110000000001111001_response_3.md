Potential error location: The potential error location is in the if-else logic inside the function. The function is trying to return the length of the iterable, but the if-else logic is incorrect and needs to be updated.

Reason for the bug: The if-else logic is not correctly checking whether the iterable has a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute, and the logic is not nested properly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use a simple if-else logic to first check if the iterable has a "shape" attribute, and if not, then check if it has a "__len__" attribute. If not, then we can return the length of the iterable directly using the len() function.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
