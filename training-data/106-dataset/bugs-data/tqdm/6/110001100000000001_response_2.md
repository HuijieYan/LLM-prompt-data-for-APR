Potential error location: The potential error is in the conditional statement that tries to determine the length of the iterable object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the conditional statement does not cover all possible cases for determining the length of the iterable object. It tries to check for the 'shape' attribute and '__len__' attribute separately, but this approach may not cover all possible iterable types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can use a more comprehensive approach to check the length of the iterable. This can be done by first checking if the iterable has a 'shape' attribute, and if not, then checking if it has a '__len__' attribute. If neither of these conditions is met, we can simply return the value of 'self.total'.

Corrected code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
