Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the conditional statement. The code contains multiple ternary conditional operators without the necessary conditions, making the logic unclear and error-prone.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the conditional logic is not written correctly. The function is trying to handle different scenarios, such as checking if the 'iterable' has a 'shape' attribute or a '__len__' attribute, but the logic is convoluted and confusing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we should rewrite the conditional statements so that the logic is clearer and more maintainable. It would be better to use traditional if-else statements to handle each scenario separately.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
