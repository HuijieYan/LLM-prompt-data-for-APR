The issue seems to be related to the 'tqdm' module and its interaction with multiprocessing 'Pool' when the 'disable' parameter is set to True. It appears that when 'disable' is set to True, the 'tqdm' object does not have the 'total' attribute, leading to the error.

After analyzing the provided buggy function, it seems that the potential error location is in the line "return self.total if self.iterable is None else \", as it tries to access the 'total' attribute of 'self' without checking if it exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly handle cases where 'total' or 'iterable' attributes are not present in the object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the 'iterable' attribute exists, and depending on that, access its length or 'shape[0]' attribute if available. Additionally, we should handle the case where 'total' attribute is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, 'total') else 0
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, 'total') else 0
```
