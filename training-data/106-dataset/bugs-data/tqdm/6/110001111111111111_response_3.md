1. The test case is trying to use the `tqdm` function to display a progress bar for the `pool.imap` operation. However, the `tqdm` object is throwing an AttributeError because it does not have the attribute `total`.

2. The potential error location is within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object, where it is trying to access the `total` attribute.

3. The bug occurs because the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object is trying to access the `total` attribute without checking if it exists. This attribute is typically used to determine the total number of iterations in order to calculate the progress.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a check to see if the `total` attribute exists before accessing it. If it does not exist, then the method should fall back to the length of the `iterable` attribute or the length of the iterable itself.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # Default case when total and iterable are not available
```
