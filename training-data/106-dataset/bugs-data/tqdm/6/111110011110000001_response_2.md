1. The test function "test_imap()" calls the `tqdm` function with a "pool.imap()" method. The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which is triggered by the "__len__" function within the `tqdm` class.

2. The potential error location is within the "__len__" function of the `tqdm` class.

3. The bug occurs because the "__len__" function is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the `tqdm` object, which is not defined. This is likely due to incorrect handling of the `iterable` and `total` attributes within the "__len__" function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases where the 'total' attribute and the 'iterable' attribute are not defined. Additionally, we also need to ensure that the 'iterable' attribute has the necessary methods and attributes to determine its length.

5. Corrected code for the "__len__" function:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
