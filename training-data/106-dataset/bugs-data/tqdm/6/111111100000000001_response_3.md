Potential error location: The potential error location is the use of the ternary operator in the return statement of the __len__ function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The use of nested ternary operators and lack of proper handling for all possible cases of self.iterable can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use if-else statements to handle all possible cases of self.iterable and improve readability. 

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
