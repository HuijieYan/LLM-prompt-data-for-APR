Analyzing the test case and error message, it seems that the 'tqdm' object is trying to access an attribute called 'total' which does not exist, resulting in the AttributeError. This is likely occurring because the 'tqdm' object is being used with the 'disable=True' parameter in the test function, which may not correctly handle the 'tqdm' object with 'disable' mode.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the '__len__' method, where it tries to access the 'total' attribute without proper handling for the 'disable' mode.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '__len__' method is assuming the existence of 'total' attribute without checking for the 'disable' mode, causing the AttributeError when 'disable=True' is used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adding a check in the '__len__' method to handle the case when 'disable' mode is set to True, and return an appropriate value or handle the attribute access differently.
2. Modifying how the 'tqdm' object works with the 'disable' mode to ensure that attribute access is handled correctly in this mode.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def __len__(self):
        if self.total is None:
            return len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") else 0
        else:
            return self.total
```

In the corrected code, the '__len__' method now checks if 'total' is None, and if so, it returns the length of the iterable using '__len__' method if available, or 0. Otherwise, it returns the value of 'total'. This ensures that the 'disable' mode is properly handled and the AttributeError is avoided.
