The issue seems to be related to the `tqdm` library and its `disable` parameter when used in combination with the `multiprocessing` module. The error message 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total' indicates that the `tqdm` object being used does not have a 'total' attribute.

The potential error location within the function is the usage of `self.total` in the return statement. It seems that the `self.total` attribute is not always present or valid for the `tqdm` object, leading to the error.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the `self.total` attribute without verifying if it exists or is valid for the given `tqdm` object. This leads to the AttributeError when the attribute is not present.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `self.total` attribute is present and valid before using it in the return statement. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle cases where `self.iterable` is `None` or does not have a valid `shape` attribute. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.iterable` is `None` and return `self.total` if it is. Then, we check if `self.iterable` has a `shape` attribute, and if so, return the length of the shape. If not, we check if `self.iterable` has a `__len__` attribute and return its length. If none of these conditions are met, we return `self.total` as a fallback. This should handle the cases where the `tqdm` object does not have a valid `total` attribute.
