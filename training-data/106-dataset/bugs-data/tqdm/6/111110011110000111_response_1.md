1. The error message is indicating that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'. This means that the 'total' attribute is not defined within the 'tqdm' class, which is causing the AttributeError when the '__len__' method is called.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'return self.total' statement within the '__len__' method.

3. The bug occurs because the 'tqdm' class does not have a 'total' attribute defined, but the '__len__' method is trying to return it. This is likely causing the 'tqdm' object to raise an AttributeError when the 'test_imap' function is called.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the '__len__' method to correctly handle the case when the 'total' attribute is not defined. We can use a conditional check to determine if 'self.total' exists, and if not, then check for other attributes such as 'self.iterable.shape[0]' or 'len(self.iterable)', and finally return a default value if none of the attributes exist.

5. Fixed code for the '__len__' method:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
             return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
             return len(self.iterable)
        else:
             return 0  # replace 0 with the default value you want to return
``` 

By using the corrected code, we can handle the cases where 'self.total', 'self.iterable.shape[0]', and 'len(self.iterable)' may not be defined, and avoid the AttributeError that was occurring.
