The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'. This means that the '__len__' function in the 'tqdm' class is trying to access the 'total' attribute, which is not available.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'return self.total' part of the '__len__' function. This code is trying to return the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object, which is not defined.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'total' attribute is not properly initialized or defined within the 'tqdm' class. The 'total' attribute is used to determine the length of the iterable, but it is not being set correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly initialize the 'total' attribute when the 'tqdm' object is created. This can be done by checking if the iterable is not None and then setting the 'total' attribute based on the length of the iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the '__len__' function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'total' attribute is not None and return it if it is set. If not, we then check if the 'iterable' is not None and determine the length based on the type of the iterable. If both 'total' and 'iterable' are not available, we return 0.

This fixes the bug by correctly handling the cases where 'total' and 'iterable' are not properly initialized.
