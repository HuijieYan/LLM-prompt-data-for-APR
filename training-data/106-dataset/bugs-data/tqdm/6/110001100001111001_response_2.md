Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is that it tries to return the length of the `self.iterable` object. However, it uses multiple conditional statements to determine the length, which may lead to unexpected results.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function tries to handle multiple different types of iterables (e.g., numpy arrays, lists, etc.) using conditional statements, which can lead to inconsistent behavior and unexpected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function can be fixed by directly returning the length of the `self.iterable` object using the `len()` function. This approach simplifies the code and ensures that the correct length is returned regardless of the type of iterable.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        return len(self.iterable)
```
