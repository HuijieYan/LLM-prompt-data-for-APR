The error occurs when the test function `test_imap` is executed. It tries to use the `tqdm` object, which then raises an AttributeError because it is missing the 'total' attribute. This points to an issue in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

The potential error location is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class, where it tries to access the `total` attribute without checking if it exists.

The bug occurs because in the `__len__` method, the code is returning `self.total` without checking if `self.total` exists. If `self.total` does not exist, it should return the length of `self.iterable` instead.

To fix this, we can update the `__len__` method to first check if `self.total` exists. If it does, return `self.total`; if not, then check if `self.iterable` exists. If it does, return its length.

Here is the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
# Class declaration containing the corrected __len__ method
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, "total"):
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") and hasattr(self.iterable.shape, "__getitem__"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        else:
            return 0  # or any appropriate default value
```

With this corrected code, the `__len__` method first checks for the existence of `self.total` and returns it if it exists. If it doesn't, it checks for the existence of `self.iterable` and returns its length if it exists. If neither exists, it returns 0 or any other appropriate default value.
