Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the conditional statement that checks if the iterable has a shape or length attribute. The usage of ternary operators seems to be causing confusion and potentially incorrect behavior.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the improper use of ternary operators and the conditional checks for the attributes "shape" and "__len__" of the iterable object. The function is not handling all the cases correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the cases where the iterable has a shape attribute, a length attribute, or neither. We can use if-else statements to make the logic clearer and easier to follow.

Corrected Function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
