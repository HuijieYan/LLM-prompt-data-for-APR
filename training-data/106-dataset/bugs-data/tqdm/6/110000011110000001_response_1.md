The error message states that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which suggests that the 'total' attribute is being accessed in the function __len__ and the 'tqdm' object does not have this attribute.

The potential error location in the problematic function is the use of the 'total' attribute without proper checking if it exists.

The bug occurred because the function __len__ was trying to access the 'total' attribute from the 'tqdm' object without checking if it exists, leading to an AttributeError when the attribute was not found.

To fix the bug, we should add a check for the 'total' attribute before accessing it and return the appropriate length based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
