Potential error location: The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', so the issue likely lies within the __len__ method of the tqdm class.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The __len__ method is improperly trying to access the 'total' attribute of the tqdm object without checking if it exists, leading to an AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the __len__ method to properly handle cases where the 'total' attribute may not exist in the tqdm object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
