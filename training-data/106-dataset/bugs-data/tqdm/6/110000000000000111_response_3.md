The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.total` without it being properly defined. This is likely the cause of the AttributeError 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `__len__` is trying to access an attribute `total` of the object `self`, which is not defined within the scope of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `total` is correctly defined for the object `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    return len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") else 0
```

In this corrected code, we removed the usage of `self.total` and instead used `len(self.iterable)` if `self.iterable` has the attribute `__len__`. If `self.iterable` does not have the attribute `__len__`, we return 0. This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
