The error message is indicating that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total'. This is likely causing the AttributeError when the 'test_imap' function is executed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the '__len__' method. Specifically, the line 'return self.total' is causing the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '__len__' method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object, which does not exist.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to check if the 'total' attribute exists before accessing it, and return 0 if it doesn't. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the fixed function
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        else:
            return 0
```
