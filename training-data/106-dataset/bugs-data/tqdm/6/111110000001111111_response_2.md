The issue is occurring because the `tqdm` class does not have an attribute `total` which is used in the buggy function `__len__`.

The potential error location is at the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None else ...` where `self.total` is being accessed without being defined.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` function of the `tqdm` class is trying to access the `total` attribute which is not defined in the class.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `self.total` is accessed. We can use a conditional statement to check if `self.total` is available and return it, otherwise, we can continue with the existing logic for retrieving the length of the iterable.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```
