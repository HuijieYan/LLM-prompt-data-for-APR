Potential error location: 
The error is likely in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class where it is trying to access the attribute `self.total` without proper validation.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `__len__` method is trying to access the attribute `self.total` without first checking if it exists. This causes the AttributeError when the attribute is not found.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.total` exists before accessing it.
2. Use a default value if `self.total` does not exist.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") and (self.iterable is None) else \
        (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
         else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
         else self.total)
```
