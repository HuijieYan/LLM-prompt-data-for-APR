The error message 'AttributeError: 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'' indicates that the 'tqdm' object does not have a 'total' attribute, which is being accessed in the '__len__' method. The error occurs when the 'disable' parameter is set to True and multiprocessing 'Pool' is used.

The potential error location is within the '__len__' method of the 'tqdm' class in the _tqdm.py file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '__len__' method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object, which is not available when the 'disable' parameter is set to True.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the '__len__' method to handle the case when the 'disable' parameter is set to True and the 'total' attribute is not available.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:

```python
# this is the corrected __len__ method
def __len__(self):
    if self.disable:
        return 0
    else:
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
             else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
             else self.total)
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for the 'disable' attribute before accessing the 'total' attribute. If 'disable' is True, the method returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to access the 'total' attribute as before.
