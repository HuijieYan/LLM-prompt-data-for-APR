# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tqdm_6/tqdm/_tqdm.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __len__(self):
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
