1. The test case creates an instance of `tqdm` and calls `pool.imap()` method on it. This calls the `__len__` method in the problematic function, which throws an AttributeError.

2. The potential error location is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

3. The error occurs because the `__len__` method is trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, which does not exist. This causes the AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, the `__len__` method should be modified to handle the attribute error and return the correct length based on the type of the `iterable`.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
