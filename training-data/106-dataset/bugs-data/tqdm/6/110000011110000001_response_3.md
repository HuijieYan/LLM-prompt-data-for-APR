The error message is indicating that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', and this is occurring within the __len__ method of the 'tqdm' object. This suggests that the __len__ method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the object, but it does not exist.

The potential error location within the problematic function is here:
```python
return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
        (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
         else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
         else self.total)
```

The code is trying to return the 'total' attribute if 'iterable' is None, and if 'iterable' has shape, then it returns the number of rows in the shape. Then, if 'iterable' has a __len__ method, it should return the length of the 'iterable', otherwise it returns 'self.total'. The issue is that if 'iterable' is not None, it is trying to access the 'total' attribute which may not exist.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where 'iterable' is not None and 'iterable' does not have a 'shape' attribute or a __len__ method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

This code first checks if 'iterable' is None and returns 'self.total' if true. If 'iterable' has a 'shape' attribute, it returns the number of rows in the shape. If 'iterable' has a __len__ method, it returns the length. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0. This should address the issue and prevent the AttributeError related to 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.
