1. The error message indicates that the AttributeError is raised in the `__len__` method of the tqdm object. It is failing at the line where `self.total` is being used, indicating that the `tqdm` object has no attribute `total`, which is causing the AttributeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return` statement in the `__len__` method.

3. The occurrence of the bug is due to the `__len__` method trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, which does not exist. This is causing the AttributeError.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `total` attribute exists in the `__len__` method before using it. If it doesn't exist, a default value can be returned instead.

5. Corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        return (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
                else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
                else self.total)
```
