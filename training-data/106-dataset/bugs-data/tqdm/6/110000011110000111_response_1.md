1. The test case is using the `tqdm` library to track the progress of a multiprocessing task using `Pool.imap`. However, when the `disable` argument is set to `True`, it results in the error message `'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__len__` method. The error message specifically mentions that the `tqdm` object does not have the attribute 'total', and the `__len__` method is where this attribute is being accessed.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `disable` argument is set to `True`, the progress bar is disabled and the `total` attribute, which tracks the total number of iterations, is not initialized. This leads to the AttributeError when the `__len__` method tries to access the `total` attribute.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking for the existence of the `total` attribute before accessing it within the `__len__` method. If the `total` attribute does not exist, a default value or behavior can be provided to handle this case.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __len__(self):
    # Check if the iterable is None
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        # Check if the iterable has a shape attribute
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        # Check if the iterable has a __len__ attribute
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total  # Return a default value when 'total' is not available
```
