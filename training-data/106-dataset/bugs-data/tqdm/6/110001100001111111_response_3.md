Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `__len__` method of the given `tqdm` class. The error is likely occurring because the `self.total` attribute is being accessed directly without proper validation checks.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The error is occurring because the `__len__` method does not properly handle the case when `self.total` is accessed without checking the existence of `self.iterable` or its attributes.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
A possible approach for fixing the bug is to add proper validation checks to ensure that `self.total` is accessed only when it is safe to do so. This can be achieved using conditional statements to check for the existence of `self.iterable`, its attributes, and the presence of `self.total`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
