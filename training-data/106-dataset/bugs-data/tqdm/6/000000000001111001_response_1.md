Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the multiple conditional statements within the return statement. The ternary conditional operator is not properly structured, which may result in incorrect logic and unexpected behavior.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the ternary conditional operator is not properly structured. As a result, the logic for returning the length of the iterable is not correctly implemented. 

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use separate if-else statements instead of nested ternary conditional operators for better readability and maintainability.
2. Check if the iterable is None first and return the value accordingly.
3. Use a try-except block to handle the case where the length of the iterable is not available.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
