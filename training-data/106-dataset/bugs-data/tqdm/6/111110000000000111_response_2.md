1. The test case is using the `tqdm` function from the `tqdm` module and a multiprocessing `Pool` to process a range of values. The error occurs when the `disable` parameter is set to `True`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__len__` method, specifically in the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None else...` because it tries to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, which may not exist.

3. The error occurs because when the `disable` parameter is set to `True`, the `tqdm` object's `iterable` is set to `None`, which causes the `__len__` method to try to access the `total` attribute, resulting in the error `'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'`.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to check if `self.iterable` is not `None` before accessing its attributes. If it is `None`, then simply return the value of `self.total`. Additionally, we can also add a check to handle the case when `self.iterable` has the `shape` attribute.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

With this correction, the `__len__` method will first check if `self.iterable` is not `None`, and then proceed to access its attributes accordingly. This should fix the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
