The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of 'self.total' without being defined in the class. This is likely the cause of the error message 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', so attempting to return 'self.total' in the function is causing the error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if 'self.total' exists before attempting to return it. If it does not exist, then we can default to returning the length of the iterable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, "total"):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # or handle this case in a way that is appropriate for the specific use case
```
