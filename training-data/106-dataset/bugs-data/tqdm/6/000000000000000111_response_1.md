The issue seems to be related to the `tqdm` library when used with multiprocessing and the `disable` argument. The error message 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total' indicates that the 'tqdm' object is missing the 'total' attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `self.total` usage in the return statement. It seems that the `total` attribute may not always be present in the `self` object, leading to the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `tqdm` object is not properly handling the `disable` argument in the context of multiprocessing, which causes the `total` attribute to be missing in certain cases.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `total` attribute exists in the `self` object before accessing it, and providing a default value if it doesn't exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # default value if total attribute doesn't exist
```
