Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.total` without checking if `self.iterable` is None or not. This can lead to the 'tqdm' object having no attribute 'total' when the function is called with `disable=True` as seen in the GitHub issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when `self.iterable` is None, and it tries to access the attribute `self.total` without checking its existence.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.iterable` is None before trying to access its attributes or length.
2. If `self.iterable` is None, return the value of `self.total` directly.
3. If `self.iterable` is not None, then check for its shape or length and return accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
