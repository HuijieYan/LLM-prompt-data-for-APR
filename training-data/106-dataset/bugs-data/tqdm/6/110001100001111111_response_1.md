Potential error location: The problem seems to be with the `__len__` method in the buggy function, specifically the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None else` where `self.total` is being accessed without checking if it exists.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total' suggests that the `tqdm` object does not have a 'total' attribute, which is being accessed without proper validation in the `__len__` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if `self.total` exists before accessing it.
2. Handle the case where `self.iterable` is None separately from the other cases.

Corrected code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total
```
