The bug is likely occurring within the `format_meter` function of the `tqdm` class. The variable `total_fmt` is not being handled correctly when the `total` is None. The error message "TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType'" suggests that there is an issue with comparing an integer to None.

The bug is likely caused by not handling the case where `total` is None. When `total` is None, the variable `total_fmt` is being set to None, which is not being handled properly later in the code.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle the case where `total` is None by setting `total_fmt` to a default value, such as None or an empty string.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None):
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is not None:
        total_fmt = str(total)
    else:
        total_fmt = ''  # set a default value when total is None

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (omitted code) ...
```
With this fix, the `total_fmt` variable will always be assigned a value, either the string representation of `total` or an empty string when `total` is None. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring.
