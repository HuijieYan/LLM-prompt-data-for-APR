The potential error in the code is located in the section that formats the progress bar. It seems like the code is trying to handle both unicode and ASCII characters in the progress bar, but there are some issues with the logic.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of unicode and ASCII characters when creating the progress bar. The logic for determining the length of the bar and the characters used to fill it does not seem to be correct, leading to discrepancies in the progress bar display.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic for determining the length and filling of the progress bar. It may be necessary to revise the calculations for determining the length of the bar based on the percentage of completion and the available width for the progress bar.

Additionally, the logic for handling unicode and ASCII characters should be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure consistent and accurate display of the progress bar.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    format_interval_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    if total and n <= total:
        percentage = n / total
        n_fmt = f"{n}/{total}"
        remaining = total - n
        remaining_str = format_interval(remaining / rate) if rate else '?'
        elapsed_str = format_interval_str
        rate_fmt = f"{n / elapsed}{unit}/s"
        if unit_scale:
            unit_suffix = format_sizeof(n)
            total_suffix = format_sizeof(total) if total else '0'
            rate_fmt = f"{unit_suffix}{unit}/{total_suffix}{unit} [{elapsed_str}<{remaining_str}, {rate_fmt}]"
        else:
            rate_fmt = f"{n}/{total} [{elapsed_str}<{remaining_str}, {rate_fmt}]"
    else:
        n_fmt = str(n)
        rate = n / elapsed
        elapsed_str = format_interval_str
        rate_fmt = f"{rate}{unit}/s"

    # return the formatted string
    return f"{prefix}{n_fmt}/{total} [{elapsed_str}, {rate_fmt}]"
```
