The error occurs in the `assert` statement where the expected output has an additional section at the end "[00:12<00:09,  8.10it/s]". This suggests that the `format_meter` function is not generating the expected output, and the bug might be related to how the progress bar and stats are formatted.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue lies in the construction of the string in the portion where the progress bar is built. The incorrect concatenation of strings is causing the unexpected output.

The bug might be related to the incorrect concatenation of strings when building the progress bar, specifically the pieces of the format being assembled. Therefore, a possible fix would involve reviewing the construction of the `format_meter` function and fixing how the different sections of the output string are concatenated.

```python
# The corrected `format_meter` method
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # Piece together the bar parts
    bar_sections = l_bar + full_bar + r_bar

    return bar_sections
```

In the corrected code, the pieces of the progress bar and stats are concatenated appropriately, and the correct bar output is returned.
