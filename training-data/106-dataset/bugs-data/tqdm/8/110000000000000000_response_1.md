The method lacks the class and method definitions to make the code runnable.

Here's a possible partial implementation to put the given method in a class:

```python
class Progress:
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                     ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                     bar_format=None):
        if total and n > total:
            total = None

        format_interval = "Write your format_interval method here"
        elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

        if rate is None and elapsed:
            rate = n / elapsed
        inv_rate = 1 / rate if (rate and (rate < 1)) else None
        
        # Rest of your implementation here
        # ...
```

You should fill in the `"Write your format_interval method here"` with the actual method definition. If this method is to be used in a real Python module, you would need to import it.

The code provided is complex and it's not complete. The missing parts include the methods like `format_interval` and `_unich`, which seem to be utility functions used within the `format_meter` method. If you have those methods already defined somewhere else, you should add them to the class.
