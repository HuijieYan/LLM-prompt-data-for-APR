The provided function calculates a progress bar and related statistics based on the input parameters. It uses the parameters to calculate the progress percentage, remaining time, and other related values. 

The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles different input values, particularly when `total` is not specified. This leads to incorrect calculations and formatting in cases where `total` is set to `None`.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `total` parameter needs to be adjusted, and additional checks for `total` should be included. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    # New check added to handle total=None case
    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # ... remaining code ...

    #Part of the code where the fractional and percentage progress
    #is calculated is moved to a new function.
    if total:
        def calculate_progress():
            # fractional and percentage progress
            frac = n / total
            percentage = frac * 100
            return frac, percentage

        frac, percentage = calculate_progress()

        # remaining code...
        # Replacing 
        if total and n > total:
            total = None
        # with
        if total and n > total:
            return (prefix if prefix else '') + '{0}{1} [{2}, {3}]'.format(
                n, unit, elapsed_str, rate_fmt)

    # remaining code...

    # temporary variables are assigned to according to new progress calculation function,
    remaining_str = format_interval((total - n) / rate) if rate else '?'
    l_bar = (prefix if prefix else '') + '{0:3.0f}%|'.format(percentage)

    # ... remaining code ...
```
