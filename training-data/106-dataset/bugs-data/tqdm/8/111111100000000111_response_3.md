The potential error location within the function is where the `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` functions are called without referencing the class itself. This means that the correct functions are not being called within the class `tqdm`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` functions are not being correctly referenced within the class `tqdm`. Without referencing the class itself, the functions are being called as standalone functions and not as methods of the class.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calls to `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` to reference the class itself by using `self.format_interval` and `self.format_sizeof`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    elapsed_str = self.format_interval(elapsed)

    # if unspecified, attempt to use rate = average speed
    # (we allow manual override since predicting time is an arcane art)
    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed
    inv_rate = 1 / rate if (rate and (rate < 1)) else None

    rate_fmt = ((self.format_sizeof(inv_rate if inv_rate else rate)
                 if unit_scale else
                 '{0:5.2f}'.format(inv_rate if inv_rate else rate))
                if rate else '?') \
        + ('s' if inv_rate else unit) + '/' + (unit if inv_rate else 's')

    if unit_scale:
        n_fmt = self.format_sizeof(n)
        total_fmt = self.format_sizeof(total) if total else None
    else:
        n_fmt = str(n)
        total_fmt = str(total)

    # Add the rest of the original code here...
```
