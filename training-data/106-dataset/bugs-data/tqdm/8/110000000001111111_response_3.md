The potential error in the provided function is that the conditional statement for checking the total value is incorrect. The condition `total and n > total` should be changed to `total is not None and n > total`.

The bug occurs because the current condition checks if `total` is a non-zero value, but it should check if `total` is not `None`. Additionally, specifying `total` as zero is a valid use case and should not result in `total` being set to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly check if `total` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (the rest of the function remains the same)
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total is not None and n > total:
        total = None

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced the condition `total and n > total` with `total is not None and n > total`, ensuring that it correctly checks if `total` is not `None`.
