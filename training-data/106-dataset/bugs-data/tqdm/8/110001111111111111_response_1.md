The error occurs in the `format_meter` function for the test case where `bar_format` is specified. The error message indicates that the format of the result does not match the expected format. It seems like the `{n_fmt}/{total_fmt}` part of the format is missing from the result.

The bug likely occurs because the `bar_format` is not being applied correctly in the `format_meter` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `bar_format` is correctly applied to the output based on the provided parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    if bar_format:
        l_bar, r_bar = bar_format.split('{bar}')
        full_bar = l_bar + 'bar' + r_bar
        return full_bar.format(**bar_args)
    else:
        return l_bar + full_bar + r_bar
```

In this corrected code, we properly handle the `bar_format` by splitting it into the left and right components, and then using them to format the progress bar. This should ensure that the `bar_format` is correctly applied to the output.
