The potential error location in the problematic function is the `format_interval` function. This function is being called with the `elapsed` parameter, but the `format_interval` function is not defined within the `tqdm` class. Instead, it seems to be intended to be called as a separate function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `format_interval` function is not defined within the `tqdm` class, causing a NameError when the `format_meter` function is called.

To fix this bug, the `format_interval` function should be defined outside the `tqdm` class and called within the `format_meter` function as a standalone function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# define the format_interval function outside the class
def format_interval(t):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected format_meter function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... other code ...

    # this is the corrected format_meter function
    @staticmethod
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                     ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                     bar_format=None):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
        ...
        """
        
        # extract format_interval function from global scope
        global format_interval

        # ... other code ...
    
        # call the format_interval function from the global scope
        elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

        # ... remaining code ...
```
