Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is the improper handling of the conditions in the return statement within the `__len__` function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditions in the return statement are not properly nested, leading to ambiguity and incorrect logic flow.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by properly nesting the conditions in the return statement to ensure the correct value is returned based on the availability of different attributes in the `iterable` object.

Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
