1. The test case `test_imap` is trying to use the `tqdm` package to show a progress bar for the `multiprocessing.Pool` function. However, it is encountering an error related to the `tqdm` object not having an attribute called `total`. This error occurs when the `disable=True` parameter is used, indicating that the problematic function is related to the progress bar disable functionality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__len__` method, where the `self.total` attribute is accessed, but it is not properly handled when the progress bar is disabled.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object does not properly handle the case when the progress bar is disabled. It assumes the existence of the `self.total` attribute even when the progress bar is disabled, leading to the AttributeError when the attribute does not exist.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the progress bar is disabled, and if so, returning the length of the iterable directly without accessing `self.total`.
   - Adding a condition to check if `self.total` exists before accessing it, and if it doesn't, then return the length of the iterable without accessing `self.total`.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None and not self.disable:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0
```

In the corrected code, I added a check for `self.disable` to handle the case when the progress bar is disabled. Additionally, I also added a check for the existence of `self.total` before accessing it. If it exists and the progress bar is not disabled, then `self.total` is returned. Otherwise, it falls back to checking the length of the iterable using `shape` and `len`.
