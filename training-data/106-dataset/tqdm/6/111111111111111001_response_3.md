The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object does not have an attribute 'total', which is being accessed in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__len__` method. The `self.total` attribute is being accessed without any check, which can lead to the AttributeError being raised if `self.total` does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is assuming the existence of the `self.total` attribute without checking for its presence.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to check for the existence of the `self.total` attribute before accessing it. We can use the `getattr` function to safely access the `self.total` attribute and provide a default value if it does not exist.

Here is the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    return getattr(self, 'total', 0) if self.iterable is None else \
        (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
         else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
         else getattr(self, 'total', 0))
```

In this corrected code, `getattr(self, 'total', 0)` is used to safely access the `self.total` attribute, providing a default value of 0 if it does not exist. This ensures that the `__len__` method does not raise an AttributeError if `self.total` is not present.
