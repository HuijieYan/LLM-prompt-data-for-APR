The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which suggests that the problem lies within the `__len__` method of the 'tqdm' object. The method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object, but this attribute is not defined, leading to an AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is not properly handling the case where the 'iterable' attribute is None.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__len__` method to properly handle the case where the 'iterable' attribute is None. We can use an if-else statement to check if the 'iterable' has shape attribute or if it is iterable using `__len__` method, and return the appropriate length. If none of the conditions are met, we can return `self.total`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

By making these changes, the `__len__` method will now correctly handle the case where the 'iterable' attribute is None and avoid the AttributeError.
