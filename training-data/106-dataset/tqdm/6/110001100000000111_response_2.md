Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `self.total` without checking if it exists first.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if `self.total` exists before trying to return its value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check to see if `self.total` exists before returning its value. If it does not exist, then the function should check if the iterable has a shape attribute, and if that does not exist, it should check if the iterable has a `__len__` attribute before returning the length of the iterable.

Corrected code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, "total"):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
