The test case 'test_imap' is calling the 'tqdm' function with the 'disable' argument set to True. However, the function '__len__' called by the 'tqdm' function is raising an AttributeError as it is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object, which is not defined.

The potential error location is within the '__len__' method of the 'tqdm' class.

The error occurred because the '__len__' method attempts to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object without checking if it exists.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the '__len__' method to handle cases where the 'total' attribute does not exist. This can be done using conditional checks.

Here's the corrected code for the '__len__' method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if not hasattr(self, 'iterable'):
        return 0
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
