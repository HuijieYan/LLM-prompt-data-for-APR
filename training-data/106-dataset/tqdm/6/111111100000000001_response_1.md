The error in the provided function is that it attempts to access the 'shape' attribute of the 'iterable' object without checking if the 'iterable' object actually has a 'shape' attribute. This can lead to an AttributeError if the 'iterable' object does not have a 'shape' attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to first check if the 'shape' attribute exists before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

By checking if the 'shape' attribute exists before accessing it, we prevent the AttributeError that could occur if the attribute does not exist. This ensures that the function will behave correctly for different types of iterable objects.
