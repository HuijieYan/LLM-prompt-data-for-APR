1. The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', and this occurs when using the 'disable' parameter and multiprocessing 'Pool' in the test case.

2. The potential error location is within the '__len__' method of the 'tqdm' class, which is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the object.

3. The error occurs because the '__len__' method is attempting to access the 'total' attribute of the 'tqdm' object without checking whether the attribute exists or not. This causes an 'AttributeError' when the 'total' attribute is not present, as in the case of using the 'disable' parameter.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the '__len__' method to first check if the 'total' attribute exists before trying to access it. If the attribute does not exist, a default length value can be returned.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...



    # corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0
```
