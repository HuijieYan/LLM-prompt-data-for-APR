Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is with the use of the ternary operator. It currently has multiple conditions but does not have a fallback if none of the conditions are met.

Reason for Bug:
The buggy function does not handle the case where the iterable does not have a shape or a length, resulting in a potential AttributeError.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can use if-elif-else statements to check for the conditions and return the appropriate length based on the type of the iterable.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
