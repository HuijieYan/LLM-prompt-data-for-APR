Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to return the length of the iterable, but it has some issues with the conditional logic.

Reasons for the bug: The conditional logic is not properly evaluating the length of the iterable. It is checking for the presence of "shape" and "__len__" attributes in the iterable which may not always be present.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use try-except blocks to handle the cases where "shape" or "__len__" attributes are not present.
2. Check if the iterable is None before trying to access its length.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        try:
            return len(self.iterable)
        except TypeError:
            return self.total
```
