The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which is being referenced within the buggy function '__len__'.

The potential error location is within the '__len__' method where 'self.total' is referenced.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', and this is causing an AttributeError when the '__len__' method is called.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the '__len__' method to handle the case where 'self.total' is not available. We can use the 'iterable' object to obtain the length. If 'iterable' has a 'shape' attribute, we can return the length based on 'shape', if it has a __len__ attribute, we can return its length, and if neither is available, we can return the length of 'self.iterable'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
