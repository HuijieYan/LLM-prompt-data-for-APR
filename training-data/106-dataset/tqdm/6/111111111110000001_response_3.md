The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which is being accessed in the __len__ function of the tqdm class. This means that the object does not have a 'total' attribute, resulting in an AttributeError when the code attempts to access it.

To fix this bug, the __len__ function needs to be modified to handle cases where the 'total' attribute is not present in the object. One approach could be to check if the 'total' attribute exists and return its value, otherwise handle the cases for 'iterable.shape[0]' or 'len(iterable)' if those attributes exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
