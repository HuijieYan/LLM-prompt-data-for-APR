The test case test_imap() is attempting to use the tqdm library to track the progress of a multiprocessing.Pool task. However, it is encountering an AttributeError with the message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'". This error is occurring in the __len__() method of the tqdm library.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement in the __len__() method. The error occurs because the 'tqdm' object does not have the attribute 'total', which is referenced in the return statement.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the __len__() method in the tqdm library is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the object, which is not available in the 'tqdm' object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__() method to first check if the 'total' attribute is present in the object. If it is not present, then it should return the length of the iterable attribute. If the iterable does not have the '__len__' attribute, then it should return the length of the iterable using the len() function. If none of these conditions are met, it should return 0.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__() method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, "total"):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
