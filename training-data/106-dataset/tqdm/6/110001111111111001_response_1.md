1. The test case `test_imap` is trying to use the `tqdm` library to track the progress of a multiprocessing operation using a `Pool`. However, it encounters an error related to the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object.

2. The error message points to the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object.

3. The error occurs because the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` object is trying to access the `total` attribute of the object, which seems to be missing.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `total` attribute is correctly assigned and available for access within the `__len__` method. This might involve initializing the `total` attribute during the object creation or modifying the conditional statement in the `__len__` method.

5. Corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the conditional statements to ensure that each case handles the length calculation properly based on the availability of the attributes. This should fix the issue with the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` object.
