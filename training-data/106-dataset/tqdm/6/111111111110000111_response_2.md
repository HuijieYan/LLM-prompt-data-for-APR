The error message is indicating that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', which is being accessed in the '__len__' function of the 'tqdm' class. This is causing an AttributeError.

The potential error is in the '__len__' function of the 'tqdm' class, where 'self.total' is being accessed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', but the '__len__' function is trying to access it.

To fix the bug, we can modify the '__len__' function to handle the case where 'total' does not exist as an attribute of the 'tqdm' object.

Here's the corrected code for the '__len__' function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'tqdm' object has the 'total' attribute. If it does, we return the value of 'total'. If it does not, we check if the 'iterable' has the 'shape' attribute, and if it does, we return its length. Next, we check if the 'iterable' has the '__len__' attribute, and if it does, we return its length. Finally, if none of these conditions are met, we return 0.

This modified function will handle the case where 'total' does not exist as an attribute of the 'tqdm' object, and it will return the appropriate length based on the available attributes.
