The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which means that the 'total' attribute is not defined in the 'tqdm' class. This is likely the reason for the bug when using the 'imap' function in the test case.

To fix the bug, the 'total' attribute needs to be defined in the 'tqdm' class. It seems that the 'total' attribute is intended to represent the total number of iterations, so it should be initialized in the class constructor (__init__ method) or set using a setter method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    def __init__(self, total=None, iterable=None):
        self.total = total
        self.iterable = iterable

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __len__(self):
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
             else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
             else self.total)
```

With the 'total' attribute properly defined in the constructor, the bug should be fixed, and the test should pass without errors.
