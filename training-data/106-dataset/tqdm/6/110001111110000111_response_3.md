Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.
2. The error occurs when using 'disable=True' and multiprocessing 'Pool'.

Error Location:
The error is likely located within the __len__ method of the buggy function. The if-else conditions in the return statement may not be handling the 'disable' case properly.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The 'disable=True' flag is causing the buggy function to not have the 'total' attribute, leading to the AttributeError. This is likely due to the conditional return statement in the __len__ method not properly checking for the 'disable' case.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the 'disable' flag is set to True, and handle the __len__ method accordingly.
2. Account for the 'disable' case in the conditional return statement to prevent the AttributeError.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tqdm_6/tqdm/_tqdm.py
# Fixing the __len__ method
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
