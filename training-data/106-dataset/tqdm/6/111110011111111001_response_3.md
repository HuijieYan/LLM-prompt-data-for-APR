Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to be occurring at the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None`, specifically when it tries to access the attribute 'total'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which suggests that the 'total' attribute has not been defined for the 'tqdm' object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the 'total' attribute is defined for the 'tqdm' object. This could involve setting the 'total' attribute when the object is initialized.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def __len__(self):
        return getattr(self, 'total', 0) if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
             else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
             else getattr(self, 'total', 0))
```
In the corrected code, we use the `getattr()` function to check if the 'total' attribute exists for the 'tqdm' object. If it does not exist, the default value of 0 is returned. This prevents the AttributeError if 'total' is not defined.
