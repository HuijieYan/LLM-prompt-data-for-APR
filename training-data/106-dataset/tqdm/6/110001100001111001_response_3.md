Potential error location: The issue could be with the way the function is trying to determine the length of the iterable. It checks for the presence of a 'shape' attribute first, then for the presence of a '__len__' attribute, but this logic may not cover all cases.

Reason for the bug: The function incorrectly assumes that the iterable might have a 'shape' attribute (which is mostly found in numpy arrays) and a '__len__' attribute. This assumption may not be valid for all iterables.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to update the function to correctly handle different types of iterables and not rely on assumptions about attributes like 'shape'.

Corrected code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total

    if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
