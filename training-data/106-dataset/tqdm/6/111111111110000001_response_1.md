The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', and this is raised when calling the 'tqdm' object with 'pool.imap(incr, range(100))' in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the '__len__' method, where 'self.total' is being used without checking whether 'total' exists as an attribute or not. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'total' attribute is not being properly initialized or checked for existence in the 'tqdm' object.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if 'total' exists as an attribute before using it in the return statement of the '__len__' method.

Here's the corrected code for the '__len__' method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```

This corrected code first checks if the 'total' attribute exists, and if it does, it directly returns 'self.total'. If 'total' doesn't exist, it then checks the existence of 'shape' or '__len__' attributes in 'self.iterable' and returns the length accordingly. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0.
