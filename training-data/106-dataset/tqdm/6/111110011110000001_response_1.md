The error is occurring because the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class is trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, which does not exist. This is causing an `AttributeError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that the `total` attribute exists before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

With this change, the `__len__` method first checks if the `total` attribute exists and returns it if it does. If not, it then checks if the `iterable` has a `shape` attribute and returns its length. If that doesn't exist either, it checks if the `iterable` has a `__len__` attribute and returns the length. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0 as a default length value.

This should fix the bug and prevent the `AttributeError` from being raised when using the `tqdm` object.
