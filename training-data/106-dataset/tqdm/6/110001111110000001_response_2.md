The test function `test_imap` is attempting to use the `tqdm` library to show a progress bar for a multiprocessing task. However, it is encountering an `AttributeError` because the `tqdm` object does not have an attribute named `total`. This error is originating from the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` module.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return self.total`, which assumes that the `tqdm` object has a `total` attribute. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tqdm` object does not have a `total` attribute, leading to the AttributeError when the `__len__` method is called.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to handle cases where the `tqdm` object does not have a `total` attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `self.iterable` has a `shape` attribute and return its length if it does. If it does not have a `shape` attribute, we check if it has a `__len__` attribute and return its length if it does. If it does not have either, we return `self.total`. This approach ensures that the `__len__` method handles all possible cases without relying on the `total` attribute.
