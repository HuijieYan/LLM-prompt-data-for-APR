The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', which is related to the '__len__' function we need to fix. The '__len__' function is used to determine the length of an object, and it is called when the 'tqdm' object is being used as an iterable. The bug is likely occurring because 'total' is not defined for the 'tqdm' object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the '__len__' function to check if the 'iterable' attribute exists and has a 'total' attribute. If not, then we can fallback to the default behavior, which is to return the length of the 'iterable' using the 'len' function.

Here's the corrected code for the '__len__' function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self.iterable, 'total'):
        return self.iterable.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, 'shape'):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, '__len__'):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

By checking for the existence of the 'total' attribute in the 'iterable' first, we can avoid the AttributeError that was occurring in the buggy code. This corrected code provides a more robust way to determine the length of the 'tqdm' object when used as an iterable.
