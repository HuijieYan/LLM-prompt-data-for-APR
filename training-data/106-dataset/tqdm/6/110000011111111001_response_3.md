The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which is causing the AttributeError. This error is likely occurring in the __len__ method of the tqdm object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the __len__ method. The code tries to access 'self.total' without checking if 'self' actually has the 'total' attribute. This is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where 'self.total' is not an attribute of the object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ method to check if 'self.total' is an attribute of the object. If it is not, we can then proceed with the other checks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, "total"):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # Return a default value if none of the conditions are met
```
