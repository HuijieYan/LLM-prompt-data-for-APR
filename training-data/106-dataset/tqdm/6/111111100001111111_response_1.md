Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the __len__ function of the tqdm class, specifically in the line "return self.total" when the 'total' attribute is not defined, leading to the error message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'".

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code returns self.total without checking if the 'total' attribute is defined. This leads to the error when trying to access 'total' attribute which does not exist.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ function to properly handle the cases where the 'total' attribute is not defined. We can use a conditional check to ensure that 'total' is available before returning it.

Corrected Code:

```python
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
                return self.iterable.shape[0]
            elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
            else:
                return 0 # or any other default value
        else:
            return 0 # or any other default value
```
In the corrected code, we added a conditional check to see if the 'total' attribute is available. If it is, we return it. If not, we proceed to the next condition to handle other cases where 'total' is not defined.
