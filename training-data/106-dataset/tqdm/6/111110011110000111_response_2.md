1. The test case is trying to use the `tqdm` library to track the progress of a multiprocessing `Pool` operation. However, the test fails with an AttributeError because the `tqdm` object has no attribute 'total'.

2. The potential error location within the `tqdm` class is the `__len__` method, specifically the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tqdm` class is expecting an attribute `total` to exist, which is not present in the current implementation. This causes the AttributeError when the `__len__` method is called.

4. To fix the bug, the `__len__` method should be modified to handle situations where the `total` attribute is not present. It should return the length of the iterable if available, or default to `self.total` if it exists.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```

With this correction, the `__len__` method will first check if the iterable is None and return `self.total` if it is. If not, it will check for the presence of `shape` and `__len__` attributes to return the length of the iterable. If none of these conditions are met, it will default to `self.total`.
