The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__len__` method. The error occurs because the `__len__` method is trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, which leads to the `AttributeError: 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is trying to access an attribute (`total`) that is not present in the `tqdm` object. This attribute should be checked for existence before trying to access it.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to check if the `total` attribute exists before returning it. If it doesn't exist, the method should fall back to checking if the `iterable` has a `shape` attribute or a `__len__` attribute. If none of these exist, it should return a default value. 

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, "total"):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # or any default value
```
