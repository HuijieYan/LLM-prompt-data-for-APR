Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the return statement. The `self.total` is being returned without proper handling, which can result in the error message `'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the attribute `self.total` without checking if it exists. In the provided example, when `disable=True`, the `tqdm` object may not have the attribute `total`, leading to the error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should check if the attribute `self.total` exists before returning it. Additionally, it should handle the case when `self.iterable` is not `None` and does not have a `shape` attribute or `__len__` attribute.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:  # Check if self.total exists
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):  # Check if shape attribute exists
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):  # Check if __len__ attribute exists
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # Handle the case when none of the conditions are met
```
