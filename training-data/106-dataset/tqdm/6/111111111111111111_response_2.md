1. The test_imap function in the test_synchronisation.py file is attempting to use the tqdm progress bar with multiprocessing.Pool and is passing the disable=True parameter to disable the progress bar. However, this is causing an AttributeError due to the 'tqdm' object not having the 'total' attribute.

2. The potential error location is within the __len__ method of the tqdm class.

3. The bug is occurring because when the disable=True parameter is passed, the __len__ method of tqdm is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the tqdm object, which does not exist when the progress bar is disabled.

4. To fix the bug, one approach would be to modify the __len__ method of the tqdm class to handle the case when the progress bar is disabled. We can check for the 'disable' parameter and only try to access the 'total' attribute if the progress bar is not disabled.

5. Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method of the tqdm class:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if not hasattr(self, 'disable') or not self.disable:
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
             else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
             else self.total)
    else:
        return 0
```

With this correction, the __len__ method now checks for the 'disable' parameter and returns 0 if the progress bar is disabled, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
