Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __len__(self):
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
             else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
             else self.total)
    
```




# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total' when using 'disable' and multiprocessing 'Pool'
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
The following MWE shows how to get the error message described in the title:

from tqdm import tqdm
from multiprocessing import Pool

def f(arg):
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pool = Pool()
    list(tqdm(pool.imap(f, range(100)), disable=True))
tqdm Version: 4.22.0
python 3.6.0
Win64
It works, when the disable=True is removed or set to False. But it should also work for the disabled case I would guess.
```



# Instructions

1. Analyze the test case and its relationship with the error message, if applicable.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Explain the reasons behind the occurrence of the bug.
