1. The test case involves using the tqdm module from the Python library to track the progress of a task run in parallel using the multiprocessing Pool. The error occurs when the disable parameter is set to True, resulting in the error message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'".

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "return self.total" as it is trying to access the 'total' attribute without checking if it exists.

3. The bug occurs because the __len__ method of the tqdm class tries to access the 'total' attribute without first checking if it exists. When the 'disable' parameter is set to True, the 'total' attribute is not initialized, leading to the error "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'".

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the __len__ method to first check if the 'total' attribute exists and only return its value if it does. If the 'total' attribute does not exist, we can then check if the 'iterable' has a 'shape' attribute and return its length if it does, or simply return the length of the 'iterable' if it has a __len__ attribute.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```
