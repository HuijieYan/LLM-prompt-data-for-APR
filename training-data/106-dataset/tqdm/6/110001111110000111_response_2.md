The test case `test_imap` is calling the `tqdm` function with the `disable=True` argument. This means that the progress bar should not be displayed during iteration. 

The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object does not have an attribute called `total`. This suggests that the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object is attempting to access `self.total`, which is not defined.

The potential error location within the `__len__` method is the line that tries to access `self.total`. It seems like the `total` attribute is not being properly initialized for the `tqdm` object.

The reason behind the bug is likely that the `total` attribute is not being set properly when `disable=True` is passed to the `tqdm` function. This causes the `__len__` method to fail when trying to access `self.total`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to handle the case where `self.total` is not defined. This can be achieved by checking if `self.total` is not None before attempting to use it. If it is None, then the method can calculate the length based on the iterable.

Another approach could be to ensure that the `total` attribute is properly initialized for the `tqdm` object even when `disable=True` is used.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # default return value if total and iterable are both None
```
