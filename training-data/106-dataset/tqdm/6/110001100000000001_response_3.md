Potential error location: The issue may be with the expression `self.total if self.iterable is None else ...` which seems to be incorrectly handling the length calculation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The current function is trying to handle the length calculation for different types of iterables, but the logic is convoluted and may not be handling all cases correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can simplify the logic and handle the cases of None and non-None iterables separately to ensure proper length calculation. Additionally, we can handle the case where `self.total` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total if self.total is not None else 0
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0
```
