Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `__len__` function within the `tqdm` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `__len__` function is trying to access the `total` attribute of the `tqdm` object, but the `total` attribute is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the `__len__` function to handle the case when the `total` attribute is not defined by checking if it exists before accessing it. Additionally, we can also provide a default value for `total` in case it is not defined.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...




    # corrected __len__ function
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'total'):
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0  # default value if total is not defined
```
