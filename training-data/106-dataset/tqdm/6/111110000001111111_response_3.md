The error message `'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'` indicates that the `total` attribute is missing in the `tqdm` object, leading to the error when it is being accessed in the `__len__` method. This is likely due to the fact that the `total` attribute is not initialized correctly in the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class.

To fix the bug, the `total` attribute should be properly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class. If the `total` attribute is not available, the `__len__` method should return the length of the iterable if it is a sequence type (e.g., list, tuple, etc.), and if not, it should return the default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
# class declaration with corrected function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    def __init__(self, iterable, total=None):
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.total = total

    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total
```
