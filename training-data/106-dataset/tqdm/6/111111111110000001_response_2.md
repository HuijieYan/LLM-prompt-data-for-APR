The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which leads to an AttributeError. This suggests that the issue lies within the __len__ function of the tqdm class.

The bug occurs because the __len__ function is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the tqdm object without checking if it exists. This leads to the AttributeError when 'total' is not present in the object.

To fix this bug, a check for the existence of the 'total' attribute should be added before attempting to access it. This can be done using an if statement to check if the attribute exists before accessing it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'total'):
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # or some other default value if 'total' is not found
```
