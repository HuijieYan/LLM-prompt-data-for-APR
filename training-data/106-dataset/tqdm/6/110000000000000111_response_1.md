Potential error location: The potential error lies in the if-else condition inside the __len__ function. The code is trying to access a 'total' attribute from 'self' but it seems that the 'tqdm' object does not have a 'total' attribute, which is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The 'total' attribute is not available for the 'tqdm' object when it is disabled, causing the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the 'tqdm' object has a 'total' attribute before accessing it.
2. If 'tqdm' has no 'total' attribute, you may want to fall back to a different attribute or method to get the length of the iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # Return a default value in case 'self.iterable' does not have a length
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'iterable' object has a 'shape' attribute, and if it does, we return the length of the first dimension using its value. If not, we check if the 'iterable' object has a '__len__' attribute, and if it does, we return the length of the iterable using the 'len' function. Otherwise, we return a default value (in this case 0). This approach avoids trying to access the 'total' attribute, which may not be available in all cases.
