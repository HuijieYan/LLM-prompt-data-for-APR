The error message indicates that there is no 'total' attribute in the 'tqdm' object, and the AttributeError is raised when trying to access it in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

The potential error location is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class, specifically in the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None else ...`. The error occurs because the 'total' attribute is not defined in the `tqdm` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'total' attribute is not being set in the `tqdm` class, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access it in the `__len__` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to handle the case when the 'total' attribute is not defined. We can use the `len` function to get the length of the iterable if it exists, otherwise, return 0.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class tqdm(object):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __len__ function
    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total if hasattr(self, 'total') else 0
        else:
            return self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") else \
                len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") else 0
```

This corrected code handles the case where the 'total' attribute is not defined and returns the length of the iterable using the `len` function if it exists, otherwise returning 0. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
