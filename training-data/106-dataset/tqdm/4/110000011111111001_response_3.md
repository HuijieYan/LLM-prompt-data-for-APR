The error occurs in the `format_meter` function when it tries to multiply the `total` with the `unit_scale`. The issue arises because `total` is set to None in the code if a certain condition is met, and then the code tries to multiply None with an integer which leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case when `total` is None separately or ensure that `total` is not set to None when `unit_scale` is applied. Additionally, the code should ensure that the variable `total` is not altered within the function to maintain data integrity.

Here's the corrected `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    if total is not None:
        total_before_scale = total

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = total_before_scale

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # ... (rest of the original code)

    if total_before_scale:
        # fractional and percentage progress
        frac = n / total_before_scale
        percentage = frac * 100
        # ... (rest of the original code)
```

In this corrected code, the `total` value is preserved before applying `unit_scale` and used when `total` is not None. This ensures that the original value of `total` is not lost and can be used in subsequent calculations.
