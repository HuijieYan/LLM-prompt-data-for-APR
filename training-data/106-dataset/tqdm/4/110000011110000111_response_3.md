The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
total *= unit_scale
```
The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable "total" is being set to None in the sanity check, and then the code tries to multiply None with an integer, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where "total" is None. We can add a check to set "total" to 0 if it is None, and then perform the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # rest of the function remains the same
```
This fix ensures that the multiplication is only performed if "total" is not None, and if it is None, it is replaced with 0 before multiplication.
