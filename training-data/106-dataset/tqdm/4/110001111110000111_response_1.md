The error occurs in the line `total *= unit_scale` within the `format_meter` function. This means that the `total` variable is being multiplied by `unit_scale` which is resulting in a `TypeError`. The reason for this bug is that the `total` variable may be `None` and when trying to perform a mathematical operation on `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication operation. If `total` is `None`, then it should remain `None` and not participate in the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)
    """
    if total is not None:  # Add a check for None
        total *= unit_scale

    # Rest of the function implementation remains unchanged
```

By adding the check for `total` before performing the multiplication, we ensure that the bug is fixed and the function behaves as expected.
