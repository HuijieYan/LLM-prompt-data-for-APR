Potential error location: The main issue in the code is the incorrect usage of `self` as an argument in the `format_dict` method. The method is actually a static method and does not require the `self` parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug arises from the incorrect usage of `self` in a static method, which leads to a syntax error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Remove the `self` parameter from the `format_dict` method signature.
- Update all references to `self` within the method to use the class name directly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Buggy function source code fixed
# ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...


class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def format_sizeof(num, suffix='', divisor=1000):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def format_interval(t):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @staticmethod
    # this is the corrected function
    def format_dict():  # removed 'self' parameter
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    @staticmethod

                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
        ...
        """    
        # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
