The error occurs in the function `format_meter` in the `tqdm` class. The error is a TypeError related to trying to perform arithmetic operations on the `total` variable, which could be `None` due to the `if total and n > total` condition.

The reason for the bug is that the `total` variable is not being properly handled when it is `None`, causing the subsequent multiplication with `unit_scale` to raise a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is `None` by setting it to a default value, such as 0.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    ... (parameters and docstring remain the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # handle the case where total is None
    if total is None:
        total = 0

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...
    # (no modifications beyond handling the None total case)
```

This modification ensures that the `total` variable is handled properly, preventing the TypeError that was observed in the error message.
