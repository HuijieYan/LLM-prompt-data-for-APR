Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the code that calculates and formats the progress bar, specifically in the section that handles the bar_format.

Reason for Bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect formatting or calculation of the progress bar length and symbols, leading to the incorrect visual representation of the progress.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, the code needs to ensure the correct calculation and formatting of the progress bar, taking into account the total number of iterations and elapsed time.

Corrected Code:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

    Parameters
    ----------
    (parameters remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : Formatted meter and stats, ready to display.
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    
    # (remaining code remains the same)
