The error occurs in the `format_meter` function at the line `total *= unit_scale`. The `total` variable is `None`, and it is being multiplied by `unit_scale`, which is causing the `TypeError`.

The reason for the bug is that when `unit_scale` is not equal to 1 or True, the code attempts to apply the scaling by multiplying `total` by `unit_scale`. However, if `total` is `None`, it cannot be multiplied by an integer value, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `total` is `None` differently. Instead of attempting to perform arithmetic operations on `total`, we can check for `None` before applying the scaling.

Below is the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:
```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        if total:
            total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False

    format_interval = tqdm.format_interval
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `total` is not `None` before attempting to apply the scaling. If `total` is not `None`, then we perform the scaling operation; otherwise, we leave `total` as `None`. This modification ensures that there is no attempt to perform arithmetic operations on `None`, fixing the original bug.
