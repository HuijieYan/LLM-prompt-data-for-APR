The potential error with the code is that the @staticmethod decorator is used without a class definition. This suggests that the function is intended to be part of a class, but it is not currently defined within a class.

The bug occurred because the function is intended to be a method of a class, but it is missing the class definition.

To fix the bug, the function should be placed within a class definition and the @staticmethod decorator should be removed since it will no longer be necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Progress:
    def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                     unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                     postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
        """
        Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters

        Parameters
        ----------
        n  : int
            Number of finished iterations.
        ... (other parameters remain the same)
        """

        # The rest of the function remains the same
        ...
```
