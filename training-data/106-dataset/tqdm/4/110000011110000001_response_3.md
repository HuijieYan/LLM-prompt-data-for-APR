The error occurs in the function `format_meter` where the variable `total` is being multiplied by the `unit_scale`. The error message indicates that `total` is of type `None` and cannot be multiplied by an integer.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `total` is `None`, it cannot be multiplied by `unit_scale`. This multiplication is unnecessary when `total` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the multiplication by `unit_scale` only occurs when `total` is not `None`. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `total` is not `None` before performing the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='', ascii=False,
                 unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None, bar_format=None,
                 postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, **extra_kwargs):
    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None
    
    # apply custom scale if necessary
    if total and unit_scale and unit_scale not in (True, 1):
        total *= unit_scale
        n *= unit_scale
        if rate:
            rate *= unit_scale  # by default rate = 1 / self.avg_time
        unit_scale = False
    elif unit_scale and unit_scale in (True, 1):
        # Change unit_scale to 1 if it's set to True
        unit_scale = 1

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
``` 

In the corrected code, we added a condition `if total and unit_scale` to ensure that the multiplication by `unit_scale` only occurs when `total` is not `None`. We also added an `elif` condition to set `unit_scale` to 1 if it's set to `True`.
