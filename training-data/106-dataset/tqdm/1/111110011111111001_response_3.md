The error occurs when the test case `test_enumerate` is being run. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError in the `tqdm/std.py` file at line 423. This error is related to the prefix variable and indicates that an 'int' object is not subscriptable.

Upon analyzing the provided function `tenumerate`, it appears that the error is likely occurring at the following line in the function:
```
bool_prefix_colon_already = (prefix[-2:] == ": ")
```
This line is attempting to check if the last two characters of the `prefix` variable are ": ".

The reason behind this bug is that the `prefix` variable is expected to be a string, but in this specific case, it is being overridden by the `start` variable which is an int due to the default value of `start` being 0.

To fix this bug, the `prefix` variable should be explicitly set to an empty string if `start` is equal to 0. This can be achieved using an if-else statement.

Below is the corrected code for the `tenumerate` function:

```python
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, tqdm_class=tqdm_auto, **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tqdm_class  : [default: tqdm.auto.tqdm].
    """
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
            return tqdm_class(np.ndenumerate(iterable), total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    
    # Check whether start is 0, if yes, set prefix as empty string
    prefix = '' if start == 0 else str(start)
    
    return enumerate(tqdm_class(iterable, start, **tqdm_kwargs, prefix=prefix))
```

In the corrected code, a new variable `prefix` is introduced and assigned an empty string if `start` is equal to 0. This ensures that the `prefix` variable is always a string, preventing the TypeError encountered in the original code.
