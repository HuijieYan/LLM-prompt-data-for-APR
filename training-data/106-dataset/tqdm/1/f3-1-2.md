The code:

import tqdm
import numpy as np
slopes = np.linspace(2.5e8, 3.1e8, 101)
for i, s in np.ndenumerate(tqdm.tqdm(slopes)):
    s/2
Gives me:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-14-07dca8068b6c> in <module>()
      1 slopes = np.linspace(2.5e8, 3.1e8, 101)
      2 for i,s in np.ndenumerate(tqdm.tqdm(slopes)):
----> 3     s/2
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'tqdm' and 'int'
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks.

Hi! We use the tqdm in Catalyst a lot, thank you for this library.

My frequent case is to use tqdm together with enumerate. I keep forgetting in which order to pass what, according to this:

Wrapping enumerated iterables: use enumerate(tqdm(...)) instead of tqdm(enumerate(...)). The same applies to numpy.ndenumerate. This is because enumerate functions tend to hide the length of iterables. tqdm does not.

My suggestion is very simple, lets add an analog of trange: tenumerate to the standard functions. I can contribute this, the logic is very simple:

def tenumerate(iterable, **kwargs):
    _enumerate = np.ndenumerate if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray) else enumerate
    return _enumerate(tqdm(iterable, **kwargs))
 I have marked all applicable categories:
 exception-raising bug
 visual output bug
 documentation request (i.e. "X is missing from the documentation." If instead I want to ask "how to use X?" I understand StackOverflow#tqdm is more appropriate)
 new feature request
 I have visited the source website, and in particular
read the known issues
 I have searched through the issue tracker for duplicates
 I have mentioned version numbers, operating system and
environment, where applicable:
import tqdm, sys
print(tqdm.__version__, sys.version, sys.platform)
```

Use tqdm.tqdm befor enumerate will mess up the progress bar ouput
```
