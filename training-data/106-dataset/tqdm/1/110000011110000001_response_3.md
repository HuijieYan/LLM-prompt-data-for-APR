The error is occurring in the `tqdm/std.py` file and seems related to the `bool_prefix_colon_already` variable being used as a boolean but appears it's being treated as an integer.

The bug is occurring in the `tqdm/contrib/__init__.py` file, specifically in the `tenumerate` function. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the prefix argument, resulting in the `bool_prefix_colon_already` variable being treated as an integer when it should be a boolean.

To fix this bug, the prefix argument should be properly handled as a string, and the `bool_prefix_colon_already` should be assigned a boolean value based on whether the prefix variable already ends with a colon or not.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, tqdm_class=tqdm_auto,
               **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tqdm_class  : [default: tqdm.auto.tqdm].
    """
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
            return tqdm_class(np.ndenumerate(iterable),
                              total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    return enumerate(tqdm_class(iterable, start=start, **tqdm_kwargs))
```
