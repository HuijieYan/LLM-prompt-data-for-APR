The error is occurring in the `tenumerate` function. The function is intended to be a equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or the built-in `enumerate`, with the added feature of using tqdm for displaying a progress bar. The error message suggests that there are issues with the input arguments and how they are being used within the `tenumerate` function.

The error message is related to the `TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable`. This indicates that there is an issue with the `prefix` variable within the `format_meter` method of the tqdm library.

The bug is occurring because the `prefix` variable is being used as an integer, but it is supposed to be a string. This is likely causing issues further down the line, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to access a subscript on an integer.

To fix this bug, the `prefix` variable should be converted to a string when necessary. Additionally, the input arguments should be properly handled to ensure correct usage within the `tenumerate` function.

Below is the corrected `tenumerate` and test functions:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

# Corrected function
def tenumerate(iterable, start=0, total=None, **tqdm_kwargs):
    """
    Equivalent of `numpy.ndenumerate` or builtin `enumerate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    """
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(iterable, np.ndarray):
            return tqdm(np.ndenumerate(iterable), total=total or len(iterable), **tqdm_kwargs)
    return enumerate(tqdm(iterable, start=start, **tqdm_kwargs))

# Corrected test function
def test_enumerate():
    """Test contrib.tenumerate"""
    with closing(StringIO()) as our_file:
        a = range(9)
        assert list(tenumerate(a, **{'file': our_file})) == list(enumerate(a))
        assert list(tenumerate(a, 42, **{'file': our_file})) == list(enumerate(a, 42))
```

In the corrected code, unnecessary arguments like `tqdm_class` and `tqdm_auto` have been removed, and the use of tqdm has been simplified. Additionally, the test function has been updated to use the corrected `tenumerate` function with the appropriate arguments.
