The error occurs in the `test_format_meter` function. The assertion error is due to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output. It seems that the `l_bar` and `bar` are not separated by the correct format in the actual output.

The potential error location in the problematic function is where the progress bar is formatted using the `bar_format` argument.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the formatting of the progress bar does not match the expected format. It appears that there is an issue with the formatting of the `{bar}` in the actual output.

To fix this bug, one approach would be to ensure that the formatting of the progress bar using the `bar_format` argument is correctly implemented. Specifically, the separator between `l_bar` and `bar` needs to be adjusted to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_meter` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    # Existing code remains the same
    
    if bar_format:
        l_bar_user, r_bar_user = bar_format.split('{bar}')
        l_bar = l_bar.format(**bar_args)
        full_bar = full_bar.format(**bar_args)
        return l_bar + full_bar + r_bar
    else:
        return '{l_bar}{bar}|{n_fmt}/{total_fmt}'.format(**bar_args)
```
With this corrected code, the formatting of the progress bar using the `bar_format` argument will be handled correctly, and the assertion error in the test is expected to be resolved.
