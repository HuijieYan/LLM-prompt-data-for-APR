The error occurs when the test case is trying to compare the expected output of the `format_meter` function with the actual output. The assertion error indicates that the string comparison is failing and there is an inconsistency in the output format.

The potential error in the problematic function is the incorrect construction of the progress bar based on the parameters and formatting. The format of the progress bar is not matching the expected format when certain parameters are provided.

The bug occurs because the progress bar formatting is not handling the width allocation properly and is not correctly placing the elements such as the bar, prefix, and statistics within the allocated space.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly allocate the width of the progress bar and handle the format based on the provided parameters. Additionally, a fix in the logic that constructs the progress bar is necessary to correctly display the progress information based on the provided parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    # Ensure consistent formatting for elapsed time
    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # Calculate rate and format
    if rate is None:
        rate = n / elapsed
    
    rate_fmt = f'{rate:.2f}{unit}/s'

    # Format the progress information
    if total:
        percentage = (n / total) * 100
        remaining = format_interval((total - n) / rate)
        stats = f"{n}/{total} [{elapsed_str}<{remaining}, {rate_fmt}]"
        bar_length = 10 if ncols is None else max(1, ncols - len(stats))
        bar = "#" * int(bar_length * (n / total))
        progress_bar = f"{prefix}{percentage:.0f}%|{bar} {stats}"
    else:
        progress_bar = f"{prefix}{n}{unit} [{elapsed_str}, {rate_fmt}]"

    return progress_bar
```

With this corrected function, the progress information will be correctly formatted based on the provided parameters and the width of the progress bar will be appropriately allocated. This should resolve the inconsistencies in the output and fix the bug in the `format_meter` function.
