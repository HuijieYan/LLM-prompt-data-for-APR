The error seems to be related to the fact that the `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` functions are being referenced as if they are part of the `tqdm` class, but they are actually standalone functions outside of the class.

To fix the bug, the references to `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` should be modified to call the standalone functions directly, without referencing them through the `tqdm` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    """
    Return a string-based progress bar given some parameters
    ... (other comments remain unchanged) ...
    """

    # sanity check: total
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    # if unspecified, attempt to use rate = average speed
    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed
    inv_rate = 1 / rate if (rate and (rate < 1)) else None
    rate_fmt = ((format_sizeof(inv_rate if inv_rate else rate)
                 if unit_scale else
                 '{0:5.2f}'.format(inv_rate if inv_rate else rate))
                if rate else '?') \
        + ('s' if inv_rate else unit) + '/' + (unit if inv_rate else 's')

    if unit_scale:
        n_fmt = format_sizeof(n)
        total_fmt = format_sizeof(total) if total else None
    else:
        n_fmt = str(n)
        total_fmt = str(total)

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrections ensure that the `format_interval` and `format_sizeof` functions are called directly and are not referenced as methods of the `tqdm` class.
