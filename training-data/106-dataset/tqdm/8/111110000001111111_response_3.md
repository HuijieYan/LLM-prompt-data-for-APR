The buggy function is designed to return a formatted meter and statistics for displaying a progress bar. It accepts several parameters, including the total number of iterations, the current number of iterations, the elapsed time, and other formatting options.

The potential bug is that the calculation for percentage is incorrect. The calculation for percentage is based on the number of finished iterations over the total expected number of iterations. However, in the buggy implementation, the fractional progress (frac variable) is calculated, but the percentage is never derived from it. This leads to incorrect or missing percentage values in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to calculate the percentage based on the fractional progress, as well as perform any formatting necessary. Additionally, the bar length and format should be dynamically calculated based on the available space (if provided).

Here's the corrected implementation for the buggy function:

```python
def format_meter(n, total, elapsed, ncols=None, prefix='',
                 ascii=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, rate=None,
                 bar_format=None):
    if total and n > total:
        total = None

    if total and total > 0:
        frac = n / total
        percentage = int(frac * 100)
    else:
        frac = 0
        percentage = 0

    elapsed_str = format_interval(elapsed)

    if rate is None and elapsed:
        rate = n / elapsed

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the 'frac' and 'percentage' based on the number of finished iterations and the total expected number of iterations. We also updated the calculation of 'percentage' by multiplying 'frac' with 100 and casting it to an integer. This ensures that the percentage is properly calculated and formatted. Additionally, other parts of the function remain unchanged except for error handling and formatting improvements.

This should address the issue of incorrect or missing percentage values in the output of the function.
