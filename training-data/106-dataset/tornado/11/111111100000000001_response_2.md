The potential error in the provided function `_read_body` is that if both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present in the response, it raises an `httputil.HTTPInputError`. However, according to the HTTP protocol specification (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3), a response cannot contain both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers, so this logic is incorrect.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to remove the check for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. Instead, consider handling each case separately, as per the specification.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
        if "Content-Length" in headers:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])  # Attempt to get content length

            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")

            if code == 204 and (content_length != 0 or "Transfer-Encoding" in headers):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)

            return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)

        elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            if code == 204 and headers['Transfer-Encoding'] != 'chunked':
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)

            if headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
                return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
            else:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Invalid Transfer-Encoding")

        else:
            if self.is_client:
                return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
            return None
```

In the corrected code, we first check for "Content-Length" and then for "Transfer-Encoding" headers separately. Depending on which header is present, we handle the body reading accordingly. We also added additional checks for the 204 response code as per the HTTP protocol specification.
