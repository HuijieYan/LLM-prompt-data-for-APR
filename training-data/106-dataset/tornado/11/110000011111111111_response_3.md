The provided test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends an HTTP POST request with chunked transfer encoding to the server and expects a response containing the parsed form data. The error message indicates that the response did not contain the expected form data `{'foo': ['bar']}`.

The potential error location within the `_read_body` method is likely in the logic handling chunked transfer encoding or in the parsing of the request body.

The bug in the original function seems to stem from incorrect handling of chunked transfer encoding and potentially incorrect parsing of the request body. Due to this, the response did not contain the expected form data when parsed.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` method should be modified to correctly handle chunked transfer encoding and parse the request body according to the HTTP 1.1 protocol specifications. The correct handling of chunked transfer encoding involves reading the chunks of data from the request body and parsing them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` method:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        # Handling for Content-Length header
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        # Handling for chunked transfer encoding
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif code == 204:
        # Handling for response code 204
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or headers.get("Content-Length") not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        return b""  # Empty body for response code 204
    elif self.is_client:
        # Handling for client requests
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

With this corrected code, the `_read_body` method should now correctly handle different types of request bodies, including chunked transfer encoding, and parse the request body accordingly based on the HTTP 1.1 protocol specifications. This should ensure that the response contains the expected form data when parsed.
