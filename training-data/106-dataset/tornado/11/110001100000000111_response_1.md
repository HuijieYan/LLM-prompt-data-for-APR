Potential error: The function is not handling the case where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present in the response.

Reason for the bug: The code is checking for the presence of "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers separately, but it does not handle the case where both headers are present, which is not allowed according to the HTTP standard.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present, and raise an error if they are.
2. Update the logic to handle the presence of both headers and decide the body reading process accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
        # Transfer-Encoding headers.
        # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
    
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    
    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    
    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or headers.get("Content-Length", "0") != "0":
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        return None
    
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    
    return None
```
