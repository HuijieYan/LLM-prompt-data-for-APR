The potential error in the given function is the mishandling of the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the HTTP response. The function checks for the presence of "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the response, but it does not handle the case where both headers are present. According to the HTTP standard (RFC7230), a response cannot contain both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle this case correctly and raise an error when both headers are present. Additionally, the function should also handle the case where the "Content-Length" header contains multiple values, and validate that they are all equal. If the values are not equal, it should raise an error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
        # Validate that all values of Content-Length are equal
        if "," in content_length:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = pieces[0]
            
        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
