The problem with the given function is that it is not returning the correct value for `content_length` when the input headers and code satisfy specific conditions.

Looking at the code, it seems that the issue might be with the manipulation of the `Content-Length` header value. It checks for the presence of a comma in the `Content-Length` header, splits it, and checks for equality among the values. This logic seems unnecessary and might be causing the incorrect calculation of `content_length`.

To fix this issue, the unnecessary logic for splitting the `Content-Length` header value and checking for equality can be removed. Additionally, the if-else conditions for checking the response code and content length can be simplified.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
