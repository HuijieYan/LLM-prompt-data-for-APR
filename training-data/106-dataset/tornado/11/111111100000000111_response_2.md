Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the conditional blocks for checking the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is trying to handle cases where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present, which is not allowed according to the HTTP protocol.
2. There is a potential issue with handling comma-separated values in the "Content-Length" header.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the check for both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers, as it is not allowed by the HTTP protocol.
2. Handle the comma-separated values in the "Content-Length" header more gracefully, by either using the first value as the content length or raising an error if the values are not identical.
3. Add error handling for cases where the "Content-Length" header is not an integer.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
        if "Content-Length" in headers:
            if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
                # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
                # Transfer-Encoding headers.
                # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
            
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"].split(",")[0])
    
            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
        else:
            content_length = None
    
        if code == 204:
            # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
            # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
            # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
            if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                    content_length not in (None, 0)):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
            content_length = 0
    
        if content_length is not None:
            return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        if self.is_client:
            return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
        return None
```
