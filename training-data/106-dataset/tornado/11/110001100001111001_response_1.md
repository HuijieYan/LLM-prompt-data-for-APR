The buggy function `_read_body` is intended to read the body of an HTTP request based on the headers and other parameters. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the "Content-Length" header and the "Transfer-Encoding" header, leading to potential errors. 

In the provided test cases, the expected output value for `content_length` is `2`. However, the function is not correctly handling the case when the "Content-Length" header contains a comma-separated value, causing the `int(headers["Content-Length"])` conversion to return an incorrect value. Additionally, the function may not be handling the case for "Transfer-Encoding" and "Content-Length" headers properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle cases where the "Content-Length" header contains a comma-separated value and consider the presence of "Transfer-Encoding" header when determining how to read the body.

Below is the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
        if "," in content_length:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', content_length)
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % content_length)
            content_length = int(pieces[0])
    
        try:
            content_length = int(content_length)
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)
    
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
This corrected code addresses the issues related to handling the "Content-Length" header, including the case of comma-separated values, and the presence of "Transfer-Encoding" headers. The corrected code should produce the expected `content_length` value of `2` for the provided test cases.
