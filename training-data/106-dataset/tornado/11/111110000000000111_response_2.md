Potential error location: The potential error in the code is within the if-else conditions and the return statements. The code does not handle all possible cases, such as when both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are missing. It also does not include a check for cases when both headers are present but are valid.

Reason behind the bug: The code does not cover all possible scenarios and does not handle all edge cases, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle the case when both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are missing.
2. Include a validation step to handle cases when both headers are present but are valid and follow the HTTP protocol specifications.
3. Ensure that all possible scenarios are covered and handled appropriately, including edge cases and error conditions.

Corrected code:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length"))
        if content_length is None or not content_length.isdigit():
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Invalid Content-Length")
        content_length = int(content_length)
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    else:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
```
