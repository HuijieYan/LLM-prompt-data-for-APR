The test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends a POST request with `Transfer-Encoding: Chunked` header and expects the response body to be decoded into a dictionary using `json_decode()`. However, the response is an empty dictionary `{}` instead of `{u'foo': [u'bar']}`.

The potential error location within the `_read_body` function is the handling of the chunked transfer encoding. It's possible that the function is not correctly parsing and processing the chunked response body, leading to an empty response.

The bug occurs because the `_read_body` function does not correctly handle the chunked transfer encoding in the response. As a result, the response body is not processed and decoded properly, leading to an empty response instead of the expected dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function needs to be updated to properly handle chunked transfer encoding in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
import re
import httputil

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        else:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        if headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        else:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Unknown transfer encoding")

    if code == 204:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or content_length != 0:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)

    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

The corrected function now checks for both `"Content-Length"` and `"Transfer-Encoding"` headers separately and properly handles chunked transfer encoding. If the response contains chunked transfer encoding, it will use the `_read_chunked_body` method to process the response body. This should address the issue with the test case and ensure that the response body is decoded correctly.
