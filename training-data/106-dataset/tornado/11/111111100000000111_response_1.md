The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. The function tries to handle scenarios where both headers are present or when the "Content-Length" header is duplicated, but the logic is flawed and does not account for all edge cases.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the cases where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present or when the "Content-Length" header is duplicated. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the "Content-Length" value is not an integer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to appropriately handle the cases where both headers are present, handle duplicated "Content-Length" headers, and properly validate the "Content-Length" value. It should also account for cases where the "Transfer-Encoding" is "chunked" and when the connection is being used by a client.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
