The potential error in the function lies in the logic for handling the "Content-Length" header. The function first checks if the "Content-Length" header exists in the headers, and then tries to split the value by commas if present. However, the logic for checking and handling multiple values separated by commas seems to be incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that if there are multiple values separated by commas in the "Content-Length" header, they should be identical, and if not, it raises an error. This assumption may not hold true in all cases.

To fix the bug, a more flexible approach for handling multiple values in the "Content-Length" header is needed. This could involve handling each value separately and calculating the cumulative length to handle cases where proxies have duplicated the Content-Length headers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        content_lengths = headers.get_list("Content-Length")
        if len(content_lengths) > 1:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get duplicated.
            # If all the values are identical then we can use them,
            # but if they differ it's an error.
            if len(set(content_lengths)) != 1:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % headers.get("Content-Length"))
            content_length = int(content_lengths[0])
        else:
            content_length = int(content_lengths[0])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    # remaining code unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we use `headers.get_list("Content-Length")` to handle multiple values for the "Content-Length" header. We then check if the lengths are identical and handle them accordingly. This approach provides a more flexible and accurate way of handling multiple values for the "Content-Length" header.
