The problem occurs when the function is trying to handle the Content-Length header in the response headers. The function is expecting the value of Content-Length to be single, but it's encountering a case where it's receiving multiple values for Content-Length separated by a comma. This is leading to a splitting of the value and causing issues.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling Content-Length when multiple values are encountered. We should parse the values, check if they are equal, and then use the first value as the Content-Length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get duplicated.
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" % headers["Content-Length"])
            headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
