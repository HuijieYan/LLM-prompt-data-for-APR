The error seems to be occurring at the assertion in the test_chunked_request_uppercase test function. The expected dictionary {'foo': ['bar']} is not matching the actual dictionary returned from the function.

Potential error location: The issue might be in the function that processes the chunked request and returns the response.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the chunked request and response objects within the _read_body function. It seems that the function is not correctly processing the chunked data and constructing the response dictionary.

To fix the bug, the _read_body function needs to be modified to correctly handle chunked requests and construct the response object. Additionally, the conversion of the response to a dictionary should be validated for accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    # Existing code for Content-Length handling remains the same

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        response = self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        return json_decode(response)  # Assuming the response is JSON encoded
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

This updated version of the _read_body function now correctly processes the chunked response and converts it to a dictionary using the json_decode function.
