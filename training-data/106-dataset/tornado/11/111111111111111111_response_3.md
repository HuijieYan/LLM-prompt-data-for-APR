The error message indicates that the response obtained from the test case does not match the expected response.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for parsing the chunked body of the HTTP response.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `_read_body` function does not correctly handle chunked encoding, leading to an incorrect response being returned. The incorrect parsing of the chunked encoding results in the incorrect response being generated.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be modified to correctly handle chunked encoding. This can be achieved by properly parsing the chunked encoding and assembling the response body according to the decoded chunks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204 or (code == 0 and self.is_client):
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        # Parse and decode the chunked encoding
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif not self.is_client:  # For server
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```

With this correction, the chunked encoding will be correctly handled, and the response body will be assembled according to the decoded chunks, leading to the expected response.
