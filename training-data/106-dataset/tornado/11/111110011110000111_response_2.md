1. The test case is testing a chunked request with a specific payload, and it expects the response to be {'foo': ['bar']}. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic that handles chunked requests and builds the response body.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the current logic in the _read_body function is not properly handling the chunked request and building the response body according to the expected format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the _read_body function correctly parses the chunked request and constructs the response body according to the chunked encoding rules.
   b. Verify that the response body matches the expected format and content based on the provided test case.
   c. Check for any discrepancies in how the response body is constructed and returned in the _read_body function.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected _read_body function
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
