The bug is likely to occur in the section of the code that handles the "Content-Length" header and checks for the presence of "Transfer-Encoding" in the headers. If the "Content-Length" header is present, the code tries to extract the integer value of it and performs some checks, which might be the reason for the bug.

The bug occurs when splitting multi-valued "Content-Length" headers with a comma and then trying to convert the values to integers. This logic is flawed as "Content-Length" is meant to be a single integer value representing the number of bytes in the body of the message. This causes the function to raise an error for inputs where content_length is not expected.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic related to handling "Content-Length" headers. Instead of trying to split and convert multiple values, simply extract the first value as it should be the only valid occurrence. Additionally, a check for non-integer values should be performed before converting to an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
        if not content_length:
            content_length = 0
        else:
            try:
                content_length = int(content_length)
            except ValueError:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % content_length)
                
            if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length != 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
