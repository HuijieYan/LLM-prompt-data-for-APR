Potential error location: The error occurs when checking for both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers in the _read_body function. Additionally, there are issues with handling multiple Content-Length values, non-integer Content-Length values, and the 204 response code.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code does not handle cases where both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present, which is not allowed according to the HTTP/1.x protocol.
2. The code does not handle cases where multiple Content-Length values are present.
3. The code does not handle non-integer Content-Length values.
4. The code does not handle the 204 response code appropriately.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers and raise an error if both are present.
2. Handle cases where there are multiple Content-Length values and ensure they are all equal.
3. Handle non-integer Content-Length values by catching the ValueError and raising an error.
4. Handle the 204 response code specifically and ensure that the body is empty.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")

    content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
    if content_length:
        content_length = int(content_length)
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code 204 should not have body")
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```
