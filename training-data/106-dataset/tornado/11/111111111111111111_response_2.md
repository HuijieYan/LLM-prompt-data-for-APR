The problem seems to be with the handling of chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected output is not being generated.

The potential error location seems to be in the logic that handles chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function. The logic for parsing the chunked encoding and returning the response is likely causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual output.

The bug occurs because the logic for parsing and processing chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function is incorrect. This leads to the incorrect processing of the request body, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for parsing and processing chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function needs to be corrected. This may involve handling the chunked encoding according to the HTTP specification and ensuring that the response body is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        
        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0
    
    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"].lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif not self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected code revises the logic for parsing and processing chunked encoding in the `_read_body` function according to the HTTP specification. It handles the cases for different types of body encoding and ensures that the response body is constructed correctly.
