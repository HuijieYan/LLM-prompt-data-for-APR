1. The test case is checking the behavior of the server when receiving a chunked request with uppercase "Transfer-Encoding" header. It expects the response to contain the parsed form data from the request body.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the "Transfer-Encoding" header is checked.

3. The bug occurs because the "Transfer-Encoding" header's value is case-insensitive according to RFC 2616 section 3.6. However, the buggy function does not handle this case-insensitivity, which causes it to fail when encountering uppercase "Transfer-Encoding" in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the function should perform a case-insensitive check for the "Transfer-Encoding" header value. Additionally, it should also handle the chunked encoding in a case-insensitive manner.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            # Response cannot contain both Content-Length and
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
        if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
            # Proxies sometimes cause Content-Length headers to get
            # duplicated.  If all the values are identical then we can
            # use them but if they differ it's an error.
            pieces = [i.strip() for i in re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])]
            if len(set(pieces)) != 1:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" %
                    headers["Content-Length"])
            headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        # This response code is not allowed to have a non-empty body,
        # and has an implicit length of zero instead of read-until-close.
        # http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3
        if ("Transfer-Encoding" in headers or
                content_length not in (None, 0)):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding", "").lower() == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
