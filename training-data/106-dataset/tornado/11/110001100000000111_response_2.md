Potential error location: 
The if statement checking for both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers may be causing an issue as currently it raises an error if both headers are present, but according to the RFC specification, it should be allowed as long as they are not conflicting.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the presence of both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers, which is allowed in the HTTP RFC specification but is currently raising an error in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the condition that raises an error when both "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are present. Instead, follow the HTTP RFC specification for handling both headers.

Corrected code:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "," in headers["Content-Length"]:
            pieces = re.split(r',\s*', headers["Content-Length"])
            if any(i != pieces[0] for i in pieces):
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                    "Multiple unequal Content-Lengths: %r" %
                    headers["Content-Length"])
            headers["Content-Length"] = pieces[0]

        try:
            content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        except ValueError:
            # Handles non-integer Content-Length value.
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Only integer Content-Length is allowed: %s" % headers["Content-Length"])

        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    return None
```
