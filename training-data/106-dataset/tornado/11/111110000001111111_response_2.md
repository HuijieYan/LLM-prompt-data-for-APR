The bug in the code appears to be related to the parsing of the "Content-Length" header in the _read_body function. In the provided test cases, the variable content_length is assigned the value of 16 (int) and 2 (int) respectively. However, there is no indication in the original code that the "Content-Length" header is being parsed and assigned to the content_length variable. This is likely the cause of the issue.

To fix the bug, the "Content-Length" header needs to be parsed properly and its value assigned to the content_length variable. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the code handles different scenarios specified in the HTTP protocol, such as different content lengths, presence of the "Transfer-Encoding" header, and the response code.

Here's the corrected code for the _read_body function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError(
                "Response with both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length")
            
        content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length"))
        
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    else:
        content_length = None

    if code == 204:
        if headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") or content_length not in (None, 0):
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Response with code %d should not have body" % code)
        content_length = 0

    if content_length is not None:
        return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

In this corrected code, the "Content-Length" header is properly parsed using the get method and assigned to the content_length variable. The code also handles the different scenarios specified in the HTTP protocol as mentioned earlier.
