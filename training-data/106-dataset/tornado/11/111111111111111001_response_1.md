The provided test case `test_chunked_request_uppercase` sends a chunked request to the server and expects the response to be decoded as JSON and equal to `{'foo': ['bar']}`. However, the actual response is an empty dictionary `{}`.

The potential error location within the `_read_body` function is in the handling of chunked encoding. The function should properly handle chunked encoding and decode the response as JSON.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The provided function `_read_body` does not handle chunked encoding properly, causing the response to be decoded incorrectly.
2. The function does not parse the chunked encoding and process the chunks to form the correct response data.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_read_body` function to correctly handle chunked encoding and decode the response as JSON.
2. Use a dedicated method to handle the parsing of chunked encoding and properly process the chunks to form the response data.

Here's the corrected `_read_body` function:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        # Check for other headers and handle multiple Content-Length values
        content_length = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        if content_length > self._max_body_size:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
    elif headers.get("Transfer-Encoding") == "chunked":
        body = self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
    else:
        # No Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header, read until close
        if self.is_client:
            body = self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
        else:
            return None

    if body:
        try:
            return json_decode(body)  # Decode the response body as JSON
        except:
            return body  # Return the response body as-is if JSON decoding fails
    return None
```

In this corrected function, chunked encoding is properly handled using the `_read_chunked_body` method, and the response body is decoded as JSON using `json_decode` before returning.
