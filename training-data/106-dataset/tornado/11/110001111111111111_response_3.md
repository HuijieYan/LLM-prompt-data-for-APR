The test case 'test_chunked_request_uppercase' sends a chunked request with data 'foo=bar'. The response is expected to be parsed into a dictionary with the key 'foo' and value ['bar'].

The error message indicates that the response is an empty dictionary, which does not match the expected result.

The potential error location within the problematic function '_read_body' is likely related to the parsing of the chunked data and content length.

The bug seems to occur because the function is not correctly handling the chunked transfer encoding, which is used to send data in a series of "chunks," each with its own size indicator. As a result, the response is not being parsed correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the chunked transfer encoding and parse the response data accordingly. Additionally, it needs to ensure that the response body is read and processed correctly based on the transfer encoding and content length.

The corrected code for the problematic function '_read_body' is as follows:

```python
def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        content_length = headers.get("Content-Length")
        if content_length:
            try:
                content_length = int(content_length)
                if content_length > self._max_body_size:
                    raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Content-Length too long")
                return self._read_fixed_body(content_length, delegate)
            except ValueError:
                raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Invalid Content-Length value")
        else:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Missing Content-Length header")
    elif "Transfer-Encoding" in headers:
        transfer_encoding = headers.get("Transfer-Encoding")
        if transfer_encoding.lower() == "chunked":
            return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)
        else:
            raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Unsupported Transfer-Encoding")
    elif self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected code handles cases where the response has a valid content length, uses chunked transfer encoding, or expects the body to be read until the connection is closed. It also includes error handling for invalid or missing headers.
