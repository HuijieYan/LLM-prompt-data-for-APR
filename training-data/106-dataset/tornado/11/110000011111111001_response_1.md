The error appears to be related to the parsing of the chunked request in the `test_chunked_request_uppercase` test. The error message indicates that the expected JSON response is `{u'foo': [u'bar']}` but the actual response is an empty dictionary `{}`.
 
The bug is likely within the `_read_body` function. It's not handling the chunked request properly, which causes the incorrect response.

The function fails to parse the chunked request and return the correct response because it does not handle the chunked encoding properly. The code should parse the chunked request format and return the correct response.

To fix the bug, the `_read_body` function should be updated to properly handle parsing the chunked request. This might involve identifying and extracting the chunks from the request, decoding them, and constructing the response accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_read_body` function:

```python
import re

def _read_body(self, code, headers, delegate):
    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        raise httputil.HTTPInputError("Chunked encoding should be used instead of Content-Length")

    if "Transfer-Encoding" in headers and headers["Transfer-Encoding"] == "chunked":
        return self._read_chunked_body(delegate)

    if self.is_client:
        return self._read_body_until_close(delegate)

    return None
```

This revised function checks if the request uses chunked encoding and reads the chunked body. If chunked encoding is not found, it proceeds to read the body until close. This should properly handle the chunked request and return the correct response.
