The error message indicates a timeout occurring after 5 seconds, but it doesn't provide a clear indication of the root cause within the test case. The issue seems to be related to how the `fetch` method is being called and not necessarily the bug in the `write_headers` method.

However, upon examining the `write_headers` method, there is a potential bug in the `write_headers` function where the `Future` object is returned without being set with a result or an exception. This could potentially cause issues with asynchronous execution and waiting for a result.

To resolve the bug, we need to set the `Future` object with a result or an exception before returning it. Additionally, it's important to handle cases where the future might be cancelled.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` method:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    future = Future()

    # ... (the remaining code)

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```

By setting the `Future` object with a result or an exception, we ensure that the asynchronous execution works as expected, and it won't lead to a timeout error in the test case.
