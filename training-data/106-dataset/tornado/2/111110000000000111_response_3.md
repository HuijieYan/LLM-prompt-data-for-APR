The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `union` package without importing it. The function signature contains `Union` and `cast` which are used for type hinting, but the `union` package is not imported.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Union` type hint is used without importing the `union` package. The `Union` type hint allows for multiple possible types for an argument, and it needs to be imported from the `typing` module.

To fix the bug, the `Union` and `cast` should be imported from the `typing` module. The correction for the provided function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Union, cast

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    """
    Implements the HTTP/1.x protocol.
    
    This class can be on its own for clients, or via `HTTP1ServerConnection`
    for servers.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        if self.is_client:
            assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
            # ... rest of the code remains the same ...
```

By importing the necessary types from the `typing` module, the function can now properly use `Union` and `cast` for type hinting and resolve the previous error.
