The error occurs in the `write_headers` method of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The error message indicates a timeout, which suggests that the `write_headers` method might be taking longer than expected to execute.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of the future object and the asynchronous nature of the method.

The `write_headers` method is returning a future object, but there are conditions within the method that could result in the future object not being resolved or returned correctly, leading to a potential timeout.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the future object is resolved and returned correctly. This may involve properly handling the conditions that affect the future object and ensuring that it is set and returned without causing a timeout.

Additionally, checking the asyncio event loop and ensuring that it is properly managed within the method can also help address any potential timing issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` method:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    future = Future()

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        return future
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        return future
```

In the corrected code, the `future` object is explicitly created at the start of the method. It is then appropriately handled within the conditions to ensure that it is resolved and returned correctly. This should help prevent any timing issues or timeouts when using the `write_headers` method.
