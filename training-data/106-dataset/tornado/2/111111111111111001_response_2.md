The test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` makes a `PUT` request to a URL and expects the response body to be `b"Put body: "`. However, the function seems to be timing out during the execution.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function could be in the logic related to handling the response headers and writing the data to the stream. Based on the provided input and expected variable values, it seems that the function is not properly executing the logic for writing the headers and chunked data to the stream. This could be causing the timeout in the test case.

The issue might be occurring due to incorrect handling of the chunked transfer encoding and the header generation, leading to improper writing of the headers and data to the stream.

To fix the bug, the `write_headers` function should be modified to correctly handle the generation and writing of headers, especially when dealing with chunked transfer encoding. Additionally, the logic for setting the expected content remaining and properly handling the stream writing process should be carefully reviewed and modified as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements .HTTPConnection.write_headers."""
    
    # ... (existing code for processing start_line, headers and other related logic) ...

    if self.stream.closed():
        future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        return future
    else:
        future = Future()
        lines = [f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} {start_line.version}".encode("latin1")]
        for name, value in headers.get_all():
            lines.append(f"{name}: {value}".encode("latin1"))
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            if self._chunking_output:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            else:
                data += chunk
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        return future
```

In the corrected code, the function properly generates the header lines and combines them with the chunked data (if applicable) before writing to the stream. The stream closure is also appropriately handled. This should address the potential issues in the original `write_headers` function and resolve the timeout problem in the test case.
