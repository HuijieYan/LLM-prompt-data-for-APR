The error message indicates that the function `test_redirect_put_without_body` is timing out. This suggests that the `fetch` function is taking longer than expected to complete. The issue is likely related to the implementation of the `write_headers` method in the `HTTP1Connection` class.

Upon analysis of the `write_headers` method and the error message, it seems that the method may not be completing its execution within the expected time frame. Multiple conditional checks and future handling might be causing delays, resulting in a timeout when the test case is run.

The potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Excessive conditional checks and future handling in the `write_headers` method.
2. Future instances not being handled properly, leading to delays in execution.

To fix the bug, the `write_headers` method needs to be optimized to handle futures more efficiently. Additionally, reducing the number of conditional checks or optimizing their logic could help in improving the performance of the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` method:
```python
class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        lines = []

        # ... (existing code for request/response verification)

        # Construct the header lines
        header_lines = [f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all()]
        header_lines = [line.encode("latin1") for line in header_lines]

        lines.append(utf8(start_line.to_str()))

        # Handle chunking based on conditions
        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

        data = b"\r\n".join(lines + header_lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"

        # Write data to the stream
        future = self.stream.write(data)

        if chunk:
            # Write the chunk if present
            chunk_data = self._format_chunk(chunk)
            future = self.stream.write(chunk_data)

        return future
```
In the corrected code, the header lines are constructed more efficiently, and the chunk data is written to the stream without unnecessary checks. This optimized approach should help in reducing the execution time of the `write_headers` method and prevent the timeout issue.
