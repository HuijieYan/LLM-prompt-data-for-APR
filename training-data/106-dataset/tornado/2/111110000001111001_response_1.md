The bug is likely occurring within the `write_headers` function. The `if self.is_client` and `else` part of the code seem to be prone to the bug, as they handle different header setups based on whether the connection is a client or server connection.

The function is likely failing at the end where it sets up the `data`, `_pending_write`, and `future` values. This could be due to incorrect handling of the conditions for setting these values based on whether the stream is closed or open.

To fix this bug, we need to review the logic for setting up the future, data, and pending write. We also need to ensure that the conditions for setting the headers and other connection parameters are working correctly based on whether the connection is a client or server.

Below is the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
        # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a
        # Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
        self._chunking_output = (
            start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
        self._chunking_output = (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and self._disconnect_on_finish
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
            and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    if not self.is_client and (
        self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD"
        or isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine) and start_line.code == 304
    ):
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None

    # Construct the header lines
    header_lines = [
        f"{n}: {v}".encode("latin1") for n, v in headers.get_all()
    ]
    for line in header_lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))

    # Set up the future, data, and pending write
    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future.add_done_callback(self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```
