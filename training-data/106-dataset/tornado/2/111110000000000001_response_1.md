Potential error location:
The potential error in the given code is that the `write_headers` function is not properly constructing and returning the `Future[None]` object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the inconsistent handling of the `Future[None]` object creation and return. The assignment of the `Future` object is not consistent in all code paths, and there are scenarios where it is assigned and scenarios where it is not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `Future[None]` object is always created and returned, handling both the success and error scenarios.
2. Review and refactor the code to ensure consistent handling of `Future[None]` object creation and return within the function.
3. Add proper error handling to address possible exceptions that can occur during the creation and handling of the `Future[None]` object.

Corrected code:
```python
from typing import Union, cast

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    # ...omitted code...

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        # ... existing code ...
        
        result_future = Future()  # Create a new future for the result
        if self.stream.closed():
            result_future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete, result_future)
        
        return result_future  # Return the created future
```
