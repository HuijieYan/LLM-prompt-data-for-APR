Potential error location: The potential error in the `write_headers` function is in the line `if self.stream.closed():`. There is a missing attribute in this line - `stream` is not defined anywhere in the function. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `stream` attribute is not defined within the `write_headers` function, so it will result in an AttributeError when the function is executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Define the `stream` attribute within the `write_headers` function, either as a class attribute or as a parameter passed to the function.
2. Check where the `stream` attribute is expected to come from and make sure it's properly initialized before being used in the `write_headers` function.

Corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        stream = self.stream # Assuming stream is an attribute of the class
        if stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
            return future
        else:
            lines.append(...) # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
