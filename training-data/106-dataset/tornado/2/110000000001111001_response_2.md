Potential Error Location:
The function `write_headers` is attempting to pass a bytes object to a third-party library that only accepts string objects. This is evident from the variable `line` being a bytes object and the subsequent encoding of `header_lines`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to encode the `lines` and `header_lines` into bytes objects. This encoding results in byte objects being passed to the third-party library, causing the function to work incorrectly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that only string objects are passed to the third-party library. This can be achieved by decoding the bytes objects into string objects before passing them to the third-party library.

Updated corrected code for the problematic function:
