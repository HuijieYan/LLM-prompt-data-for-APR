The error message indicates a timeout error, meaning that the `fetch` operation within the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test case failed to complete within the specified timeout, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function is likely the generation of the `Future` object. It seems that the `Future` object is not being handled properly, leading to the timeout error. This could be due to the incorrect initialization or handling of the `Future` object within the function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug could be improper handling of the asynchronous operation and the usage of the `Future` object, which is supposed to represent the result of an asynchronous operation. If the `Future` object is not resolved or rejected properly, it can lead to a timeout error.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to ensure that the `Future` object is resolved or rejected appropriately based on the completion or failure of the asynchronous operation. This can involve handling the callback or results of the asynchronous operation and setting the result or exception of the `Future` object accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union, Any
from tornado.concurrent import Future
from tornado.iostream import StreamClosedError
from tornado import httputil, iostream

# ... (other imports and code)

class HTTP1Connection(httputil.HTTPConnection):
    # ... (other code)

    def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        # ... (other code)

        future = Future()

        if self.stream.closed():
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self.stream.write(data, self._on_write_complete, future)

        return future

    def _on_write_complete(self, future: 'Future[None]') -> None:
        if future.exception():
            self._write_future.set_exception(future.exception())
        else:
            self._write_future.set_result(None)
```

In the corrected code:
- We create a new `Future` object for each call to `write_headers`.
- When checking if the stream is closed, we set the exception on the `Future` object.
- After writing the data to the stream, we use the `_on_write_complete` callback to handle the result of the write operation and set the result or exception on the `_write_future` object accordingly.
