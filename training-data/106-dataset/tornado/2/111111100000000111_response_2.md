The potential error location within the `write_headers` function is the line:
```python
data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_format_chunk` function is expected to return a `bytes` object, but it is not returning anything. This missing return value is causing an error when trying to concatenate it with `data`.

To fix the bug, the `_format_chunk` function needs to be modified to properly return a `bytes` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    # ... (previous code) ...

    for line in lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += chunk  # No need for self._format_chunk(chunk) as it's unnecessary
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```
