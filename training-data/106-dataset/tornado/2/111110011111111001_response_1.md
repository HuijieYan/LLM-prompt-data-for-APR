The test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` makes a `PUT` request to a URL, but it times out with a `TimeoutError` when calling `self.fetch`.

Given the information provided, the potential location of the bug appears to be in the `write_headers` function of the `HTTP1Connection` class. The function generates headers and tries to write data to the stream, but something seems to be causing a timeout.

One possible reason for the timeout could be an issue with the data being written to the stream or with the processing of the future object.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `write_headers` function to ensure that the data is being written to the stream correctly and that the future is handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements HTTPConnection.write_headers."""
        # ... existing code ...

        # No changes to the existing code beyond this point

        future = self._write_future
        self._write_future = Future()

        if self.stream.closed():
            self._write_future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        else:
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

        return future
```

In this corrected code:
- The existing logic has been retained, with additional changes included to handle the future and stream writing operations.
- The original future object is stored to be returned at the end of the function, and a new future object is created for the subsequent write operation.
- The check for a closed stream and the write operation are wrapped in an `else` block to ensure that the future is set properly.

After making these changes, test the `write_headers` function with the provided test cases to confirm that the timeout issue has been resolved.
