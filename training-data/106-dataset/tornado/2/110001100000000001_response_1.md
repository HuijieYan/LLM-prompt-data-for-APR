The potential error in the given function is that it's returning the `future` object before the `pending_write` and creating the `future_add_done_callback`. This can cause the client to receive a response before the actual write operation has completed, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `future` should be returned after the `pending_write` has been created and the `future_add_done_callback` has been invoked.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
    ) -> "Future[None]":
        """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
        lines = []
        # ... (previous implementation remains the same) ...
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))

        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)

        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

        return future
```
