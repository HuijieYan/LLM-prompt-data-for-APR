The given function `write_headers` is quite complex and it's hard to understand its logic and intended behavior. However, based on the provided scenarios, it seems that the function needs to be modified to generate the correct output.

Here's the corrected `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union, List
import re

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
        lines = [
            bytes(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} {start_line.version}", 'utf-8')
        ]
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
        if start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH") and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
            self._chunking_output = True
        else:
            self._chunking_output = False
    else:
        lines = [
            bytes(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}", 'utf-8')
        ]
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        
        self._chunking_output = (self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers)
        
        # If connection to a 1.1 client will be closed, inform client
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        
        # If a 1.0 client asked for keep-alive, add the header.
        if (self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" 
            and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"):
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"

    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

    self._expected_content_remaining = 0 if self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD" or isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine) and start_line.code == 304 else int(headers.get("Content-Length", 0))
    
    # Construct header lines
    header_lines = [
        bytes(f"{n}: {v}", 'utf-8') for n, v in headers.get_all()
    ]
    for line in header_lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
    lines.extend(header_lines)
    
    future = self.stream.write(b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n")
    self._pending_write = future
    return future
```

This modified function checks the instance type of `start_line` and performs the required operations accordingly. It also correctly constructs header lines and sets the `self._pending_write` property.

This function should resolve the issues you were facing in the given test scenarios.
