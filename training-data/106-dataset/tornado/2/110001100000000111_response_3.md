The potential error location in the code is in the `write_headers` function where it is trying to return `future` without necessarily being assigned a value, leading to a NameError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `future` is not always assigned a value within the `write_headers` function, and there's a chance that the function can reach the return statement without `future` being defined.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `future` as None at the beginning of the function and reassign it later based on condition checks. This ensures that `future` will always have a value by the time the return statement is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    future = None  # Initialize future as None
    lines = []
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future  # Return future with a value
```
