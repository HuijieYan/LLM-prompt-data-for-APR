The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'headers' parameter and the conversion of headers to bytes.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to concatenate bytes with strings, perform encoding operations, and handle header_lines which are not consistent in their data types. This inconsistency can lead to errors in the function.

To fix the bug, the code needs to ensure that all operations related to headers and data types are consistent and handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
