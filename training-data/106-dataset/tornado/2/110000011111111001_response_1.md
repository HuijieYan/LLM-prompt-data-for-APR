The bug seems to be related to the handling of headers and the chunking output in the `write_headers` function. The function seems to be incorrectly setting `self._chunking_output` based on the HTTP method and the presence of certain headers. Additionally, there are some issues related to handling the headers and encoding the data.

The bug occurred because the chunking output flag `self._chunking_output` was incorrectly set in the cases where it should not have been, leading to incorrect encoding and handling of data, resulting in a timeout during the test.

To fix the bug, you can change the logic for setting `self._chunking_output` and ensure proper encoding of the headers and data.

Here is the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
from typing import Union
import tornado.httputil
from tornado.iostream import Future

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[tornado.httputil.RequestStartLine, tornado.httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: tornado.httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> Future[None]:
    lines = []
    if isinstance(start_line, tornado.httputil.RequestStartLine):
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"{start_line.method} {start_line.path} HTTP/1.1")
        self._chunking_output = start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
    elif isinstance(start_line, tornado.httputil.ResponseStartLine):
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(f"HTTP/1.1 {start_line.code} {start_line.reason}")
        self._chunking_output = start_line.code not in (204, 304) and start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200
    else:
        # Handle other cases for start_line if needed
        pass

    if self._chunking_output and "Content-Length" not in headers:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

    if "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None

    header_lines = (f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all())

    data = '\r\n'.join(lines + list(header_lines)).encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n\r\n"

    future = self._write_future = Future()
    self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
    future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```

In this corrected code, the `self._chunking_output` is set based on the method and status codes for requests and responses, and the header encoding and data encoding is handled appropriately. This should fix the bug and prevent the timeout error during the test.
