The buggy function is `write_headers` and it seems to be throwing an error related to the assertion checks and the handling of the headers.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements that handle the client and server configurations differently. This includes the `if` statement for client requests and the `else` statement for server responses.

The buggy function seems to be breaking due to several assertion checks failing, along with handling the different cases for client and server requests. This can be due to incorrect assumptions about the state of the object properties and their interactions with the input parameters.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for handling client and server requests. This involves ensuring that the correct properties are set and that all necessary checks are performed.
