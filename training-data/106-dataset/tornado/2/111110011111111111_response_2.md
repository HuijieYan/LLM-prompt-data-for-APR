The error seems to occur while running the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` in the `HTTPClientCommonTestCase` class. The test makes a PUT request to the server and expects a specific body in the response, but it times out after 5 seconds.

Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the `write_headers` function in the `HTTP1Connection` class is taking longer than expected to complete, causing the timeout error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the asynchronous code is handled, particularly in the creation and handling of the futures and the stream operations.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the asynchronous operations not completing within the expected time frame, causing the test case to time out.

To fix the bug, we can optimize the asynchronous code within the `write_headers` function, ensuring that the stream operations and future handling are efficient and do not cause delays.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
# corrected write_headers function
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    net_ref = self.stream
    if net_ref.closed():
        return Future().set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    
    lines = []
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Asynchronous write to the stream
    future = Future()
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
    self._pending_write = net_ref.write(data)
    
    # Set the write callback to handle completion
    def on_write_complete(future: 'Future[None]') -> None:
        self._on_write_complete(future)
        future.set_result(None)
    
    future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, on_write_complete)
    return future
```

In this corrected code, we optimize the asynchronous operations by directly handling the stream operations and setting a write callback to handle the completion of the write operation. This should prevent delays and ensure that the function completes within the expected time frame, resolving the timeout error in the test case.
