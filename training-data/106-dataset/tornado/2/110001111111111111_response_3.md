The error seems to be related to a timeout occurring while the `fetch` method is running in the test case `test_redirect_put_without_body`. This suggests that the `fetch` method is not completing within the expected time frame, potentially due to an issue in the `write_headers` function.

Upon analyzing the buggy `write_headers` function, it appears that the issue may lie in the part where the `pending_write` is initiated and the `_on_write_complete` method is added as a callback to the `pending_write` future. If the `pending_write` future is not being resolved or rejected properly, it can lead to the timeout issue experienced in the test case.

One possible reason for the bug could be that the `pending_write` future is not being handled correctly after it is initiated.

To fix this bug, the `_on_write_complete` callback should properly handle whether the write operation was completed successfully or with an error. Additionally, the `pending_write` future should be resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the write operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    # ... (existing code)

    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        # Resolve the future with an exception
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        
        # Create a callback function for the completion of the write
        def on_write_done(future: 'Future[None]') -> None:
            if future.exception() is not None:
                self._on_write_complete(future)
            else:
                # Handle successful write completion
                self._on_write_complete(future)
                
        # Add the new callback to the pending_write future
        future = Future()
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, on_write_done)

    return future
```

In the corrected code, a new callback `on_write_done` is added to properly handle the completion of the write operation. This ensures that the `pending_write` future is resolved or rejected as per the outcome of the write operation, which should prevent the timeout issue observed in the test case.
