The potential error in the problematic function is that the `Union` module is not imported, which causes an error when trying to use `Union` as the type for the `start_line` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Union` module is not imported, so the type `Union` cannot be used as the type for the `start_line` parameter.

To fix this bug, the `Union` module should be imported at the beginning of the file. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Union

def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    # ... [rest of the code]
```
