The test case `test_redirect_put_without_body` is related to the error message because it is trying to fetch a resource using the `PUT` method but is encountering a `TimeoutError` after 5 seconds. This suggests that the bug might be related to the data processing or request handling in the `write_headers` function.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function could be the processing of the request headers and the creation of the `data` variable.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the request headers and the creation of the data to be sent. The `write_headers` function is not setting up the request properly for the `PUT` method in the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test case.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the request headers and ensure the data is constructed properly for the `PUT` request.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None
) -> "Future[None]":
    lines = []
    if isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine):
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
        if "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
            self._chunking_output = start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH")
    elif isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine):
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and self._disconnect_on_finish:
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
        if start_line.code not in (204, 304) and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200) and "Content-Length" not in headers and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers:
            self._chunking_output = self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
    if self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD" or start_line.code == 304:
        self._expected_content_remaining = 0
    elif "Content-Length" in headers:
        self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
    else:
        self._expected_content_remaining = None
    header_lines = (f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all())
    lines.extend(header_lines)
    # rest of the code to prepare and send data goes here...
```

In the corrected code:
- The `start_line.method` and `start_line.path` are used to construct the start line for the request in the case of `PUT` method.
- The conditions for setting `self._chunking_output` are adjusted to match the correct scenarios.
- The handling of different response codes and required headers is adjusted for correctness.

This should fix the bug and allow the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test case to run without encountering a `TimeoutError`.
