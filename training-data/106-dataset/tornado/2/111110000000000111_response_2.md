The potential error location in the write_headers function is the handling of the future object. The function is returning None instead of the future object, which is not consistent with the function's return type annotation. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior when calling this function.

The reason behind the bug is the inconsistent return type of the function. The function is supposed to return a "Future[None]" object according to its annotation, but it is returning None instead.

To fix this bug, we need to create a Future object and return it at the end of the function. We also need to handle the case where self.stream.closed() is True and set the appropriate exception for the future object.

Here's the corrected code for the write_headers function:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future

# ... (other code)

# this is the corrected function
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    future = Future()
    lines = []
    # ... (other code)

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)

    return future
```
