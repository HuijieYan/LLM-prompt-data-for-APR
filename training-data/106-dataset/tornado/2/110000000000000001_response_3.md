Potential error location: The potential error could be in the encoding of the header lines, specifically in the `header_lines` variable where the headers are being encoded using the `latin1` encoding.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may occur due to encoding issues when converting the headers to bytes. The use of the `latin1` encoding may not be appropriate for all headers, leading to encoding errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more appropriate encoding, such as UTF-8, when encoding the header lines to bytes.
2. Handle any potential encoding errors that may occur when converting headers to bytes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    # Convert header lines to bytes using UTF-8 encoding
    header_lines = (
        f"{n}: {v}" for n, v in headers.get_all()
    )
    lines.extend(l.encode("utf-8") for l in header_lines)
    for line in lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```
