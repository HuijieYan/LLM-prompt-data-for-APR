The issue in the buggy function is due to wrong data formatting. The chunked data, transfer encoding, and headers are not being formatted correctly, which is causing issues in the subsequent request processing.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        if chunk is not None:
            headers["Content-Length"] = str(len(chunk)) # Add content length for client requests with a body
        self._transfer_encoding = "chunked" if chunk else None
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line.code, start_line.reason)))
        self._chunking_output = (self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1" and start_line.code not in (204, 304) and self._transfer_encoding == "chunked")
        if self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0" and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive":
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
        else:
            headers["Connection"] = "Close"
    for k, v in headers.items():
        lines.append(utf8(f"{k}: {v}"))
    data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n" + (chunk if chunk else b"")
    return self.stream.write(data)
```

This corrected function now accurately formats the transfer encoding, headers, and chunked data according to the HTTP protocol standards. Once this function has been fixed and tested, it should resolve the issues observed in the tests.
