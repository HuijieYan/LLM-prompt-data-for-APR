The issue with the provided function is that it contains a mix of both synchronous and asynchronous patterns, which can cause unexpected behavior and likely result in errors. Additionally, there are several places in the code where bytes and str types are mixed, which can lead to encoding issues.

To fix the function, we need to ensure that it follows a consistent asynchronous pattern and that the handling of byte and string types is done correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from tornado.http1connection import HTTP1Connection
from typing import Union
from tornado import httputil
from tornado.concurrent import Future
from tornado import iostream
from tornado.httputil import HTTPHeaders
from tornado.util import utf8, native_str

def write_headers(
        self,
        start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
        headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
        chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    async def _write_headers():
        lines = []
        if self.is_client:
            assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
            self._request_start_line = start_line
            lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
            # Other code remains unchanged
        else:
            assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
            # Other code remains unchanged

        if self._chunking_output:
            headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"
        if not self.is_client and (
                self._request_start_line.method == "HEAD"
                or isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine) and start_line.code == 304
        ):
            self._expected_content_remaining = 0
        elif "Content-Length" in headers:
            self._expected_content_remaining = int(headers["Content-Length"])
        else:
            self._expected_content_remaining = None
        
        header_lines = [f"{native_str(k)}: {native_str(v)}" for k, v in headers.get_all()]
        lines.extend(l.encode("latin1") for l in header_lines)
        
        for line in lines:
            if b"\n" in line:
                raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
        
        future = None
        if self.stream.closed():
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
            future.exception()
        else:
            future = self._write_future = Future()
            data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
            if chunk:
                data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
            self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
            future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
        return future

    return _write_headers()
```

In the corrected code, we have encapsulated the original function in an async function `_write_headers`. We have also fixed the type issues related to bytes and strings. Additionally, we have maintained a consistent asynchronous pattern throughout the function.
