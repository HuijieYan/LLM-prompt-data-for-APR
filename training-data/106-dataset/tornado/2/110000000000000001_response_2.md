Given the length of the original code and the complexity of the HTTP Connection class, it may not be possible to fully fix the buggy function without the complete context of the class and its dependencies. However, I can provide an example of how to encode the header lines properly, as mentioned in the bug fix approach:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line.method, start_line.path)))
        # ... (rest of the function)

    # Encoding the header lines to latin1
    header_lines = [
        f"{n}: {v}".encode("latin1") for n, v in headers.get_all()
    ]
    lines.extend(header_lines)

    for line in lines:
        if b"\n" in line:
            raise ValueError("Newline in header: " + repr(line))
    future = None
    if self.stream.closed():
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
        future.exception()
    else:
        future = self._write_future = Future()
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)
        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, self._on_write_complete)
    return future
```
Please note that this is a simplified example and might require additional adjustments based on the complete code and class context.
