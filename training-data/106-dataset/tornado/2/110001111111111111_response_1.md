The error message indicates a timeout when trying to fetch a resource using the `fetch` method with the `allow_nonstandard_methods` parameter set to `True`. This method uses the `HTTP1Connection.write_headers` function, which seems to be causing the timeout.

The potential error locations within the `HTTP1Connection.write_headers` function could be the calculations for `pending_write` and the `data` to be written to the stream. These calculations might be taking longer than expected, leading to a timeout error.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to inefficient processing or handling of the data and writing to the stream. If the data or chunk to be written is large, or if there are inefficiencies in the `pending_write` calculation, it could lead to timeouts.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include optimizing the data processing and writing to the stream to reduce calculation time. Additionally, reviewing the logic around `pending_write` and potential bottlenecks in the process could also help to identify and address the cause of the timeout error.

Here's the corrected code for the `HTTP1Connection.write_headers` function:

```python

    else:

    header_lines = [(n.encode("latin1"), v.encode("latin1")) for n, v in headers.get_all()]

    for line in header_lines:
