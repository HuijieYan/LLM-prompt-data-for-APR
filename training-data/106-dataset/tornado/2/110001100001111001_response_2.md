The error in the provided function seems to relate to the handling of the `chunk` parameter. In the code, there is a conditional statement that checks if `chunk` is not None, and if so, it attempts to concatenate `chunk` with `data`, which should be the request data. This process is supposed to format the chunk data, but the specific method `_format_chunk` is missing from the original code. This could lead to potential errors or missing functionality.

To fix the bug, an appropriate implementation of the `_format_chunk` method needs to be added or called within the `write_headers` method. This method should handle the formatting of chunked data and add it to the final request data if `chunk` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` method including a placeholder for the `_format_chunk` method:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    if chunk:
        data += self._format_chunk(chunk)  # Call the _format_chunk method here
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return future

def _format_chunk(self, chunk: bytes) -> bytes:
    # Implement chunk formatting here
    pass
```

By adding the `_format_chunk` method and updating the `write_headers` method to call it when necessary, the bug related to handling the `chunk` parameter should be resolved.
