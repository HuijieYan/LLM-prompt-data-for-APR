The buggy function `write_headers` seems to have a logic flaw based on the given test cases and expected outcomes.

The bug seems to be related to the assignment and handling of the `self._pending_write` and `future` variables. In each test case, the function returns a `Future` object without considering whether the write operation on the `self.stream` was successful or not.

The function should create a new `Future` object for the write operation and return it. Additionally, the `on_write_complete` callback should handle the resolution or rejection of the `Future` based on the success or failure of the write operation.

To fix this bug, the logic within the function needs to be modified. The correct approach would be to create a new `Future` object for the write operation, attach the `on_write_complete` callback to handle the resolution or rejection, and return the `Future` object. Within the `on_write_complete` callback, the `Future` should be resolved if the write operation was successful, or rejected if it failed.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    # ... omitted code ...

    future = Future()

    if self.stream.closed():
        future.set_exception(iostream.StreamClosedError())
    else:
        data = b"\r\n".join(lines) + b"\r\n\r\n"
        if chunk:
            data += self._format_chunk(chunk)

        def on_write_complete(f):
            if f.exception():
                future.set_exception(f.exception())
            else:
                future.set_result(None)

        self._pending_write = self.stream.write(data)
        future_add_done_callback(self._pending_write, on_write_complete)

    return future
```
