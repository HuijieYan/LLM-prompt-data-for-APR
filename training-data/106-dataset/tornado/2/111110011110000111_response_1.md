The error occurs during the `fetch` method in the `test_redirect_put_without_body` test case, specifically when the `allow_nonstandard_methods` argument is set to `True`. This error is related to the `write_headers` function in the `HTTP1Connection` class.

The potential error location within the `write_headers` function is the conditional check for handling non-standard methods. When the `method` is not within the standard HTTP methods ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH"), the code should not go into the block of setting `_chunking_output`. However, the current implementation doesn't check for this condition, leading to incorrect behavior and potential errors.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the case when the HTTP method is not "POST", "PUT", or "PATCH". As a result, the `_chunking_output` is being set incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior and possible errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional block that sets `_chunking_output` to only apply when the method is "POST", "PUT", or "PATCH". For other methods, the `_chunking_output` should not be set.

Here's the corrected code for the `write_headers` function:

```python
def write_headers(
    self,
    start_line: Union[httputil.RequestStartLine, httputil.ResponseStartLine],
    headers: httputil.HTTPHeaders,
    chunk: bytes = None,
) -> "Future[None]":
    """Implements `.HTTPConnection.write_headers`."""
    lines = []
    if self.is_client:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.RequestStartLine)
        self._request_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("%s %s HTTP/1.1" % (start_line[0], start_line[1])))
        # Client requests with a non-empty body must have either a
        # Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding.
        if start_line.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH"):
            self._chunking_output = (
                "Content-Length" not in headers
                and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
            )
    else:
        assert isinstance(start_line, httputil.ResponseStartLine)
        assert self._request_start_line is not None
        assert self._request_headers is not None
        self._response_start_line = start_line
        lines.append(utf8("HTTP/1.1 %d %s" % (start_line[1], start_line[2])))
        self._chunking_output = (
            # TODO: should this use
            # self._request_start_line.version or
            # start_line.version?
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            # 1xx, 204 and 304 responses have no body (not even a zero-length
            # body), and so should not have either Content-Length or
            # Transfer-Encoding headers.
            and start_line.code not in (204, 304)
            and (start_line.code < 100 or start_line.code >= 200)
            # No need to chunk the output if a Content-Length is specified.
            and "Content-Length" not in headers
            # Applications are discouraged from touching Transfer-Encoding,
            # but if they do, leave it alone.
            and "Transfer-Encoding" not in headers
        )
        # If connection to a 1.1 client will be closed, inform client
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.1"
            and self._disconnect_on_finish
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "close"
        # If a 1.0 client asked for keep-alive, add the header.
        if (
            self._request_start_line.version == "HTTP/1.0"
            and self._request_headers.get("Connection", "").lower() == "keep-alive"
        ):
            headers["Connection"] = "Keep-Alive"
    if self._chunking_output:
        headers["Transfer-Encoding"] = "chunked"

    # ... remaining code ...
```

By making these changes, the conditional check for setting `_chunking_output` is now specific to the "POST", "PUT", and "PATCH" methods, preventing unexpected behavior and errors.
