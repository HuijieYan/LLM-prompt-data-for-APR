The error message indicates that the function is raising a TypeError because the `args` parameter is of type `None`, which is not expected based on the function's current implementation.

The potential error location is the `if isinstance(args, dict):` block, where the function assumes that `args` is either a dictionary, list, or tuple. Since the test case is passing `None` as the `args` parameter, it triggers the `else` statement and raises a TypeError.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `args` is `None`, which is a valid scenario that needs to be accounted for.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a specific condition to handle the case when `args` is `None`. This condition should check if `args` is `None` and modify the behavior accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_concat` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qsl, urlencode, urlunparse

def url_concat(url, args):
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    
    if args is None:
        final_query = parsed_url.query
    elif isinstance(args, dict):
        parsed_query = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query, keep_blank_values=True)
        parsed_query.extend(args.items())
        final_query = urlencode(parsed_query)
    elif isinstance(args, (list, tuple)):
        parsed_query = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query, keep_blank_values=True)
        parsed_query.extend(args)
        final_query = urlencode(parsed_query)
    else:
        err = "'args' parameter should be dict, list or tuple. Not {0}".format(type(args))
        raise TypeError(err)
    
    url = urlunparse((
        parsed_url.scheme,
        parsed_url.netloc,
        parsed_url.path,
        parsed_url.params,
        final_query,
        parsed_url.fragment
    ))
    
    return url
```

Now, the function checks whether `args` is `None` and handles it as a special case. If `args` is `None`, it uses the existing query from the URL. If `args` is a dictionary, list, or tuple, it processes it as before. This should resolve the TypeError raised in the test case and make the function more robust.
