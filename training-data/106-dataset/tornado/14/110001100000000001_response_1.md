Potential error location: 

The bug is likely to be in the `initialize` method, specifically in the conditional statements that check for `make_current`. 

Reasons behind the bug:

1. In the first conditional statement, `if make_current is None`, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function is being called without the appropriate reference to the `IOLoop` class.
2. In the second conditional statement, `elif make_current`, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function is also being called without the appropriate reference.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Add the `self` reference to the `IOLoop.current` calls within the conditional statements.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` method is correctly called with the `self` reference.

Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
