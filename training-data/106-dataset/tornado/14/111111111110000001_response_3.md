The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with the `make_current` argument set to `True`. The test then checks that the current `IOLoop` instance is indeed this newly created instance, and also asserts that attempting to create another current instance should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the test case. However, the conditional check is incorrect, leading to incorrect behavior.

The issue arises from the incorrect conditional check. The code should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current instance exists and the `make_current` argument is `True`. However, the current code raises the error if either the current instance does not exist or the `make_current` argument is `True`.

The bug can be fixed by changing the conditional check to specifically raise a `RuntimeError` only if the current instance exists and the `make_current` argument is `True`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the conditional checks will work as intended, and the `RuntimeError` will only be raised when a current instance exists and `make_current` is `True`.
