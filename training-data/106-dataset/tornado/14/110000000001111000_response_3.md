# Corrected function source code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
The corrected function includes a change to the `elif` statement to `else`. Additionally, the condition in the `elif` statement has been updated to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.
