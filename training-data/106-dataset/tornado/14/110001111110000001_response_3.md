1. The test case is trying to create an IOLoop instance with the argument `make_current=True`. The test asserts that the newly created `IOLoop` instance should be the current instance and then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` to check if it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the `if` block that checks if `make_current` is `None`. It seems like the logic within this block is causing the issue.

3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, suggesting that the condition for `make_current=True` is not being handled correctly in the `initialize` function.

4. To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should be adjusted to ensure that when `make_current=True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

5. Corrected code for the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
