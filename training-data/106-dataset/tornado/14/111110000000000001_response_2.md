The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the `self.make_current()` line. The bug occurs because the `make_current` function is being called without passing any arguments, which conflicts with the function signature that requires the 'instance' argument.

To fix this bug, you should pass the 'instance' argument to the `make_current` function. Additionally, you should remove the `instance` argument from the `current` function because it's unnecessary and could cause confusion.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
