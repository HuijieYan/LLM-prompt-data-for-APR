The test case `test_force_current` is calling the `IOLoop` constructor with the argument `make_current=True`. This should create a new `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance. However, the error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, suggesting that the logic in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not working as intended.

The issue is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to make the new instance the current one. However, the condition `if make_current is None` does not consider the case where `make_current=True` is explicitly passed as an argument.

To fix this issue, the logic inside the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class should be modified to handle the case where `make_current=True` is explicitly passed as an argument. The `make_current` flag should be handled correctly to ensure that the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one when desired.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Removed the individual condition for make_current, as it's redundant
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we removed the specific condition for `make_current` and combined it with the `else` block to handle both cases. Then, we added a condition to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists and only raise an error if `make_current` is `True`. Finally, the `make_current` method is called if the conditions are met. This will ensure that the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one when `make_current=True` is explicitly passed as an argument.
