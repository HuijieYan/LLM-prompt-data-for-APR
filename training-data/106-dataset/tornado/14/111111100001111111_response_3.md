The issue is in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method checks if the `make_current` argument is None, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, then it calls the `make_current` method. However, if `make_current` is not None and is True, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then raises an error if it is not.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is True, it raises an error even if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, which is contradictory to the purpose of the variable.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None should be removed when `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # Remove the check for IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Add a check to raise an error if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
