The potential error location within the `initialize` function is at the line `self.make_current()`.

The bug is occurring because the `make_current` method is being called without passing any arguments to it, which is causing a TypeError. The `make_current` method requires the `self` argument to be passed to it, and it seems that the `initialize` function is not passing the `self` argument to it.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the `self` argument to the `make_current` method when calling it.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current(self)
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current(self)
```
