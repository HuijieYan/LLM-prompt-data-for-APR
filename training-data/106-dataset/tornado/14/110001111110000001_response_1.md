The test function `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which should set this instance as the current `IOLoop`. However, the error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is not expected.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` exists, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. The error occurs if `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists, as indicated in the error message.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic to handle the case when `make_current=True` is incorrect. It should not check if the current `IOLoop` exists; rather, it should directly make the instance as the current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` function needs to be modified to directly make the instance the current `IOLoop` if `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, if `make_current=True`, the instance will always be set as the current `IOLoop`, without checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
