1. The error occurs when the `IOLoop` is being initialized with `make_current=True`. This causes the `initialize` method to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists."

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.

3. The error occurs because the conditional statement for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` is not functioning as intended. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`.

4. To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to only raise a `RuntimeError` if both conditions are met: `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`. Additionally, the logic within the conditional statement should be adjusted to handle these cases correctly.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
