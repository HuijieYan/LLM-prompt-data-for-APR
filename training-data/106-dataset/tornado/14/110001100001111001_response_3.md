Potential error location: The buggy code is in the `initialize` method. It checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the function should be calling `make_current` instead of checking for its existence.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code incorrectly checks for the existence of `make_current` instead of calling it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `make_current` method if `make_current` is not None.
2. Remove the check for the existence of `make_current` and directly call `make_current`.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_14/tornado/ioloop.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def current(instance=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_current(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# corrected initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
