The issue seems to be with the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. 

The `initialize` method is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object and set it as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is not specified or is set to `True`. However, the current implementation is not handling the case when `make_current` is False and there is already a current `IOLoop`.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `False` and there is already a current `IOLoop`. It should only try to set itself as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions in the `initialize` method to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, the first condition handles the case when `make_current` is `None` and there is no current `IOLoop`, where it sets itself as the current `IOLoop`. The second condition handles the case when `make_current` is `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop`. If there is already a current `IOLoop` and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
