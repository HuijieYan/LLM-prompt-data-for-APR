The test case `test_filter_sub_model` tries to check if the response JSON from the endpoint "/model" matches a specific structure. The error message indicates that the "model_b" key in the response JSON contains an unexpected "password" field in addition to the expected "username" field.

Upon reviewing the provided `create_cloned_field` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the cloning of the Pydantic model fields. The function modifies the `use_type` and `new_field` based on the original type and its configuration. This may result in unexpected changes and additions to the cloned field's structure, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we can revise the cloning process to ensure that only the necessary attributes and structure are copied from the original field to the cloned field. This may involve modifying the assignment of attributes and possibly handling the nested fields, validators, and post-validation steps more carefully during the cloning process.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = field.clone()
    return new_field
```

In the corrected code, we use the `clone` method provided by Pydantic's `ModelField` class to create a cloned copy of the field. This method ensures that all necessary attributes and configurations are carried over to the new field, avoiding unwanted modifications and preserving the original structure.
