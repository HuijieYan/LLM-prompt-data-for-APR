The error message from the test function indicates that the returned JSON includes data that is not present in the specified response model. This suggests that the function is not properly filtering the response data according to the specified response model.

The potential error location within the function could be in the section that creates the new ModelField object and populates it with data from the original field.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a mismatch between the specified response model and the actual returned data, causing additional data to be included in the response JSON.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function should correctly filter the response data based on the specified response model. This may involve ensuring that the new `ModelField` object is populated with only the fields specified in the response model.

Here's the corrected version of the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    if is_dataclass(original_type) and hasattr(original_type, "__pydantic_model__"):
        original_type = original_type.__pydantic_model__  # type: ignore
    use_type = original_type
    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        original_type = cast(Type[BaseModel], original_type)
        use_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__, __config__=original_type.__config__
        )
        for f in original_type.__fields__.values():
            use_type.__fields__[f.name] = f
        use_type.__validators__ = original_type.__validators__
        
    # Create a new ModelField object with filtered data based on response model
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators={},
        default=None,
        required=False,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None),
    )
    # Populate the new ModelField object with data from the original field
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    
    return new_field
```

With this corrected function, the response data should be filtered based on the specified response model, addressing the issue raised in the test case and the associated GitHub issues.
