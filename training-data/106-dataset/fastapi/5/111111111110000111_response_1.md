The error occurs when the response is not being properly filtered according to the specified response_model. This is happening because the `create_cloned_field` function is not properly handling the creation of a cloned field with the correct attributes.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the new cloned field is created with the correct attributes and that the filtering based on the response_model is properly applied.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, FieldInfo, Field

def create_cloned_field(field: Field) -> Field:
    use_type = field.type_
    new_field = Field(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        class_validators=field.class_validators
    )
    return new_field
```

In the corrected code, we are creating a new Field with the necessary attributes based on the original field. This should ensure that the response is properly filtered according to the specified response_model.
