The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of nested Pydantic models, resulting in additional data not being properly filtered in the response.

The potential error location within the `create_cloned_field` function is the section where `ModelField` instances are being manipulated, particularly in terms of preserving the type of the nested Pydantic models.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly check and handle nested Pydantic models. When a nested model is present, the function fails to properly apply the field filtering defined in the response model.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `create_cloned_field` function to correctly handle nested Pydantic models and apply proper field filtering.

Here is the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    if hasattr(original_type, "__fields__"):
        return ModelField(name=field.name, type_=original_type, required=field.required)
    return field
```

In this corrected code, we properly check for the presence of nested models and handle them consistently. This should ensure that the response data is properly filtered according to the specified response model, fixing the issue identified in the bug report.
