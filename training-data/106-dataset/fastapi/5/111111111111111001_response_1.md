The error message from the test function `test_filter_sub_model` indicates that the response JSON does not match the expected output. Specifically, the 'model_b' field contains an additional 'password' key in the actual response JSON, which is not present in the expected JSON.

The issue seems to be related to the structure of the 'model_b' field, and this could be caused by the incorrect processing of the 'ModelField' object within the `create_cloned_field` function.

Upon analyzing the function, the potential error location seems to be the handling of the `original_type` and `use_type` variables, where the new `ModelField` is created. The logic for modifying and creating a new `ModelField` based on the original `ModelField` seems to be causing the issue.

One possible reason for the bug is that the logic for creating the new `ModelField` based on the original type is not correctly handling certain attributes or subfields. This could lead to unexpected data being present in the response JSON.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the modification and creation of the new `ModelField` accurately reflects the structure of the original field, including its type, validators, and any subfields.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, BaseModel as PydanticBaseModel, FieldInfo, ModelField
from typing import Type

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = original_type
        new_field = ModelField(
            name=field.name,
            type_=use_type,
            class_validators=field.class_validators,
            default=field.default,
            required=field.required,
            model_config=original_type.__config__,
            field_info=field.field_info,
            has_alias=field.has_alias,
            alias=field.alias,
            validators=field.validators,
            parse_json=field.parse_json,
            shape=field.shape,
            allow_none=field.allow_none,
            validate_always=field.validate_always
        )
        if field.sub_fields:
            new_field.sub_fields = [
                create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
            ]
        if field.key_field:
            new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
        return new_field
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type for ModelField creation")
```

In the corrected code, the function `create_cloned_field` now handles the creation and modification of the new `ModelField` based on the original type, ensuring that the structure is accurately reflected.

By updating the function to handle the structure and attributes of the original `ModelField` correctly, the unexpected data in the response JSON should no longer occur.
