The issue seems to be originating from the `create_cloned_field` function not correctly handling nested models when creating a new `ModelField` instance.

The root cause of the problem is due to the logic for handling nested models within the `create_cloned_field` function. When a nested model is encountered, the function needs to recursively handle the nested fields and perform the necessary transformations.

To address the issue, the `create_cloned_field` function should be updated to correctly handle nested models by recursively creating cloned fields for each nested field. This will ensure that the nested model's fields are properly processed and incorporated into the new `ModelField` instance.

Here's the corrected `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseConfig, Field, create_model

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    
    # ... existing logic ...

    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        original_type = cast(Type[BaseModel], original_type)
        use_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__, __config__=original_type.__config__
        )
        for f in original_type.__fields__.values():
            field_name = f.name
            if isinstance(f.type_, BaseModel):
                use_type.__fields__[field_name] = create_cloned_field(f)
            else:
                use_type.__fields__[field_name] = f

        use_type.__validators__ = original_type.__validators__
    # ... remaining logic ...

    return new_field
```

This updated function includes a recursive call to `create_cloned_field` for each field in a nested model, ensuring that nested fields are also properly processed and included in the new `ModelField` instance.

By implementing this change, the function will be able to correctly handle nested models and their fields, resolving the issue with incorrect filtering of nested model attributes.
