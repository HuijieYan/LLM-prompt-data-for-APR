The issue seems to be related to the nested pydantic model not being filtered according to the response_model. The bug appears to be in the `create_cloned_field` function, as it is not handling nested models properly.

The reason for this bug is that the function is not correctly creating a cloned field with the same BaseModel properties and validators.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the cloned field includes all the properties and validators of the original field, including nested fields.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pydantic import create_model
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, FieldInfo, Field, SHAPE_MAPPING
from typing import Type, List

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__,
            __config__=original_type.__config__,
            **{f.name: (f.type_, ...) for f in original_type.__fields__.values()}
        )
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=None,
        required=False,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None),
        schema=FieldInfo(None) if not PYDANTIC_1 else None,
    )
    for f in field.validators:
        new_field.add_validator(f)
    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields]
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
    return new_field
```

This corrected function should properly handle nested models and ensure that the cloned field includes all the properties and validators of the original field, including nested fields.
