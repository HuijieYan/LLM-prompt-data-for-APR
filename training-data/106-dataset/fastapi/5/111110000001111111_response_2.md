The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of nested Pydantic models in the response model. The buggy function `create_cloned_field` is supposed to clone a Pydantic model field. However, the bug makes it fail to handle nested models properly, resulting in extra data not being filtered.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle nested models correctly during the cloning process. When a nested model is encountered, the function should recursively clone the nested model fields as well. This allows for proper handling of nested models and ensures that only the fields declared in the response model are returned.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a recursive call to `create_cloned_field` for nested models, so that nested model fields are also recursively cloned.
2. Add a check to verify if the field type is a Pydantic model, and if so, clone its fields recursively.
3. Verify that the clone of the model's fields is assigned to the corresponding fields in the cloned model.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    if is_dataclass(original_type) and hasattr(original_type, "__pydantic_model__"):
        original_type = original_type.__pydantic_model__  # type: ignore
    use_type = original_type
    if lenient_issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        original_type = cast(Type[BaseModel], original_type)
        use_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__, __config__=original_type.__config__
        )
        for f in original_type.__fields__.values():
            if is_dataclass(f.type_):  # Check if the field type is a Pydantic model
                cloned_field = create_cloned_field(f)  # Recursively clone the nested model fields
                use_type.__fields__[f.name] = cloned_field  # Assign the cloned field to the corresponding field in the cloned model
            else:
                use_type.__fields__[f.name] = f
        use_type.__validators__ = original_type.__validators__
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    return new_field
```

By adding the recursive cloning of nested model fields and verifying the correct assignment of cloned fields, the function should now correctly handle nested Pydantic models in the response model. This fix should ensure that only the fields declared in the response model are returned, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
