It seems like the issue is related to the response not being correctly filtered according to the specified response_model. This is likely due to a bug in the `create_cloned_field` function, which is responsible for creating a cloned field based on the input field.

The bug in the `create_cloned_field` function is causing the response to include additional data that is not declared in the output model. This is evident from the error message and the associated detailed issue description. The response should be filtered according to the specified response_model, but this is not happening.

To fix the bug in the `create_cloned_field` function, you could modify the logic to ensure that only the fields specified in the response_model are included in the response. This can be achieved by updating the logic to create a new ModelField based on the fields specified in the response_model, and then populating this new field with the relevant data.

Here's the corrected `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, Field

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    use_type = field.type_
    
    if issubclass(use_type, BaseModel):
        new_field = ModelField(
            name=field.name,
            type_=use_type
        )
        return new_field
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid field type")
```

With this corrected function, the response should be correctly filtered according to the specified response_model. This should address the issue reported by the user and fix the bug.
