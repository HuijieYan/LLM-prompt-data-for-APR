The error occurs because the `create_cloned_field` function is not creating a deep copy of the `field` object. As a result, when the `response.json()` is compared to the expected dictionary, the `model_b` section contains extra key-value pairs not present in the expected dictionary. This is because the original `field` object is being modified when creating the new cloned field.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to create a deep copy of the `field` object and then modify the necessary attributes without affecting the original `field` object. This will ensure that the `response.json()` matches the expected dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
import copy

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = copy.deepcopy(field)
    original_type = new_field.type_
    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return new_field
```
