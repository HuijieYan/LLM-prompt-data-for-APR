The bug seems to be related to the fact that the `create_cloned_field` function is not correctly handling the `ModelField` with nested models, leading to an incorrect response in the test cases.

The function seems to be improperly updating the `use_type` with the fields of the original dataclass when processing nested models. This leads to incorrect processing of the nested models.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the nested models and update the `use_type` and other related fields. Additionally, it should properly populate the validators for the new field to ensure accurate data validation.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, create_model
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from typing import TypeVar, Type, cast

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type

    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        new_fields = {}
        for f in original_type.__fields__.values():
            new_fields[f.name] = (f.type_, f.required, f.model, f.field_info)
        use_type = create_model(original_type.__name__, **new_fields)

    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        default=None,
        required=False,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None)
    )
    
    # Populate validators
    try:
        new_field.populate_validators()
    except AttributeError: 
        new_field._populate_validators()  # Support for Pydantic < 1.0.0

    return new_field
```

This corrected code handles the nested models and correctly updates the `use_type` variable. It also ensures that the validators are correctly populated for the new field. These changes should address the bug and ensure that the response is filtered correctly according to the `response_model`.
