The error message from the test function indicates that the response from the API call does not match the expected JSON. This implies that the data model for "model_b" might not be constructed correctly, leading to incorrect data in the response.

The bug seems to be occurring in the function `create_cloned_field` while processing the input `field` of type `ModelField`. It might be failing to create a cloned field for the `ModelField`. The incorrect creation of the cloned field might not be preserving the structure of the original model, leading to the mismatch in the response from the API call.

The potential reasons for the bug could be related to the handling of sub-models within the `create_cloned_field` function. It seems that the function might not be correctly handling the cloning of `ModelField` instances for sub-models or nested models.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that when a sub-model is encountered, the `create_cloned_field` function recursively processes the sub-model fields and correctly creates cloned fields for them.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField, FieldInfo
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        field_info=field.field_info,
        has_alias=field.has_alias,  # Preserve has_alias field
        alias=field.alias,  # Preserve alias field
        allow_none=field.allow_none,  # Preserve allow_none field
        validate_always=field.validate_always,  # Preserve validate_always field
        validators=field.validators,  # Preserve validators field
        parse_json=field.parse_json,  # Preserve parse_json field
        shape=field.shape  # Preserve shape field
    )
    if field.sub_fields:
        new_field.sub_fields = [
            create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
        ]
    if field.key_field:
        new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field)
    return new_field
```

In the corrected code, we recursively process the sub-fields and preserve the necessary attributes of the original `ModelField` when creating cloned fields. This should ensure that the cloned fields preserve the structure of the original model, leading to correct responses from the API call.
