The bug appears to be related to FastAPI's response model not properly filtering out additional data in nested models. 

The create_cloned_field function appears to be responsible for creating a cloned field with the correct type. The bug may be happening in the section where the cloning of the original field is performed.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the field is a nested model and properly clone it according to the response model schema.

Here's the corrected code for the create_cloned_field function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, Field

def create_cloned_field(field: Field) -> Field:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type

    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        # Clone the original type
        cloned_type = create_model(
            original_type.__name__,
            __config__=original_type.__config__,
            **{
                f.name: (f.type_, f.default)  # Clone fields
                for f in original_type.__fields__.values()
            }
        )
        use_type = cloned_type

    new_field = Field(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators={},
        default=None,
        required=False,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        field_info=FieldInfo(None),
    )

    # Copy additional attributes
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.class_validators = field.class_validators
    new_field.default = field.default
    new_field.required = field.required
    new_field.model_config = field.model_config

    # Rest of the attribute copies...

    return new_field
```

This corrected code checks if the original type is a subclass of BaseModel, and if it is, it clones the fields from the original type and creates a new type with the same fields. This ensures that the response model schema is properly applied to nested models.
