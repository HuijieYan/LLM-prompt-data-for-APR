The issue in the given function `create_cloned_field` seems to lie with the cloning process. The function attempts to create a cloned field based on the input `field` but does not correctly handle the cloning process, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

Upon inspecting the function, it seems that there are discrepancies in the cloning logic, leading to unexpected behavior. The function attempts to clone the input `field` to create a new field, but the cloning process is not implemented correctly, leading to discrepancies in the output.

To resolve the issue, the function needs to be revised to ensure that the cloning process accurately replicates the input field based on its attributes and properties. Additionally, the handling of sub-fields and key fields should be checked to ensure that the cloning process covers all relevant attributes and associated fields.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, ModelField, FieldInfo, BaseConfig
from typing import List

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=field.type_,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        schema=field.schema,
        allow_none=field.allow_none,
        validate_always=field.validate_always,
        sub_fields=[create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields] if field.sub_fields else None,
        key_field=create_cloned_field(field.key_field) if field.key_field else None,
        validators=field.validators,
        pre_validators=field.pre_validators if hasattr(field, 'pre_validators') else None,
        post_validators=field.post_validators if hasattr(field, 'post_validators') else None,
        populate_validators=field.populate_validators if hasattr(field, 'populate_validators') else None
    )
    
    return new_field
```

In the revised function, the cloning of `field` is correctly implemented to ensure that all relevant attributes and associated fields are accurately replicated to the new field. The handling of sub-fields and key fields is included to cover all possible scenarios.

This corrected approach should address the issues with the original function and ensure that the cloning process produces the expected output.
