1. The error message from the test function indicates that the response JSON is not as expected. The 'model_b' field contains a 'password' key, which is not expected according to the test. This suggests that the 'create_cloned_field' function is not producing the expected output.

2. The 'create_cloned_field' function is the potential location for the bug, as it is responsible for creating cloned fields based on the input 'field'.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect handling of the 'field' object during the cloning process, resulting in unexpected changes to the structure of the cloned fields.

4. To fix the bug, it may be necessary to review the logic within the 'create_cloned_field' function and ensure that the cloning process accurately replicates the structure and contents of the input 'field' object. Additionally, any unnecessary modifications to the cloned fields should be removed to prevent unintended changes.

5. Below is the corrected code for the 'create_cloned_field' function:

```python
def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    use_type = field.type_
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators=field.class_validators,
        default=field.default,
        required=field.required,
        model_config=field.model_config,
        schema=field.schema,
    )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    new_field.validators = field.validators
    new_field.allow_none = field.allow_none
    new_field.validate_always = field.validate_always
    new_field.sub_fields = [create_cloned_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields] if field.sub_fields else None
    new_field.key_field = create_cloned_field(field.key_field) if field.key_field else None
    new_field.populate_validators()
    return new_field
```

This corrected code streamlines the cloning process and ensures that the structure and contents of the input 'field' object are accurately replicated. Additionally, it removes unnecessary modifications to the cloned fields to prevent unintended changes.
