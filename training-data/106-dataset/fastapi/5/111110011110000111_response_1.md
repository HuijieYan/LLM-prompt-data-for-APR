The test function `test_filter_sub_model` expects the JSON response to be filtered to include only the fields defined in the `ModelA` response model. However, the actual response includes additional fields, indicating that the bug is within the `create_cloned_field` function, which is responsible for cloning a Pydantic model's field.

The bug occurs because the `create_cloned_field` function fails to handle nested Pydantic models properly, resulting in unfiltered additional data in the response. This happens due to the incorrect handling of sub-models and their fields during cloning.

To fix the bug, the `create_cloned_field` function needs to handle nested Pydantic models and their fields correctly during cloning. This includes ensuring that the sub-models and their fields are filtered according to the specified response model.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_cloned_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, BaseConfig

def create_cloned_field(field: ModelField) -> ModelField:
    original_type = field.type_
    use_type = original_type
    if issubclass(original_type, BaseModel):
        use_type = create_model(
            f"{original_type.__name__}_cloned",
            __config__=original_type.__config__,
            __base__=BaseModel,
        )
        use_type.__fields__ = original_type.__fields__
    new_field = ModelField(
        name=field.name,
        type_=use_type,
        class_validators={},
        default=None,
        required=False,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        field_info=field.field_info,  # Assuming 'field_info' refers to the source field info
    )
    new_field.has_alias = field.has_alias
    new_field.alias = field.alias
    # ... (other field assignments)
    return new_field
```

In this correction, we handle the cloning process in a more appropriate manner, including creating a new model with the required fields and incorporating the correct field data. This will ensure that the response data is properly filtered according to the specified response model, including for nested models.

It's important to note that the specific context and usage of the `create_cloned_field` function may require further adjustments, but the core changes provided should address the bug related to nested Pydantic models not being filtered according to the response model.
