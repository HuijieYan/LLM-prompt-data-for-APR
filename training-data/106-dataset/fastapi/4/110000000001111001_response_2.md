The bug in the `get_openapi_path` function arises from the function calling itself recursively within the `for` loop to handle `route.callbacks`. This recursive call should be replaced with some other mechanism to achieve the desired result.

The bug likely occurred because of an endless recursive call within the same function, leading to an infinite loop. This recursive approach could cause the program to run out of stack space and crash.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to `get_openapi_path` in the `for` loop should be eliminated and replaced with a different mechanism to process the callbacks. This could involve iterating through the `route.callbacks` and performing the required operations without using recursion.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    # existing code

    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            # existing code for parameters, security definitions, and route responses
            path[method.lower()] = operation

            # Process route.callbacks without recursion
            if route.callbacks:
                callbacks = {}
                for callback in route.callbacks:
                    callback_operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=callback, method=method)
                    cb_parameters = get_openapi_params(callback.dependant)
                    callback_operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(cb_parameters)
                    callback_operation['parameters'] = callback_operation_parameters
                    # Populate other fields in callback_operation as needed
                    callbacks[callback.name] = {callback.path: callback_operation}
                operation["callbacks"] = callbacks

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
``` 
In this corrected code, the recursion for `get_openapi_path` within the `for` loop has been replaced with a loop to process `route.callbacks` and their operations. This change ensures that the function does not enter into infinite recursive calls and properly handles the callbacks.
