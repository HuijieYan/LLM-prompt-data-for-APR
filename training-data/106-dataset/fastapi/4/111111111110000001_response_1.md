Potential Error Location:
The function `get_openapi_path` is not correctly implemented. It is missing a return statement to return the `path`, `security_schemes`, and `definitions`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The test case is failing because the function `get_openapi_path` is not returning the expected values. It seems to be missing a return statement to return the variables `path`, `security_schemes`, and `definitions`.

Possible Approaches:
1. Add a return statement at the end of the `get_openapi_path` function to return the variables `path`, `security_schemes`, and `definitions`.
2. Revise the logic of the function to ensure that the expected values are being assigned and returned correctly.
3. Check for any other potential issues or bugs within the function that might be interfering with the expected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    
    # ... (existing code) ...

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
