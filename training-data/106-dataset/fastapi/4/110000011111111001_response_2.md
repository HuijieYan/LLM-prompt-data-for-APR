The error occurs in the dictionary key `parameters` inside the `path` variable. There are two identical entries for `user_id` in the `parameters` list. These duplicated entries are causing the dictionary comparison in the test case to fail.

This issue arises because the `parameters` list is combined from two sources: `operation_parameters` and `all_route_params`. Both of these sources contain duplicate entries for the same parameter, leading to the issue.

To fix the bug, the duplicated entries need to be removed. One approach for fixing this bug is to concatenate the `operation_parameters` and `all_route_params` lists and then use a Python dictionary to remove duplicate entries based on the parameter names.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters = {param['name']: param for param in operation_parameters + all_route_params}.values()
            # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
``` 

By using the dictionary comprehension to remove duplicates from the combined `operation_parameters` and `all_route_params` lists, the bug causing the duplicate entries is addressed.
