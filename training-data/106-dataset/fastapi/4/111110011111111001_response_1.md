The bug seems to be related to the input parameter `response_class` and its associated `media_type` attribute. Based on the error message, it looks like the response structure in the `data` and `openapi_schema` is not matching. The expected path does not contain duplication: `name='user_id', in='path'`.

It seems that the code is trying to populate the `operationId`, `parameters`, and `responses` fields for the given API route. However, it appears that the `parameters` list is being populated twice for the same parameter, causing a duplication error.

This duplication issue could be due to a lack of proper validation to check if the parameters are being added multiple times. Therefore, it's important to ensure that there are no duplicate parameters in the `operation` object before returning it.

To fix this bug, the `parameters` array should be appended only once for each unique parameter. We can achieve this by maintaining a set to keep track of the added parameters. Before adding a new parameter to the `parameters` list, we can check if it already exists in the set. If it doesn't exist, we add it to the set and the `parameters` list. If it does exist, we skip adding it again.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            
            # Add unique parameters to the operation's parameters list
            added_params = set()
            for param in operation_parameters:
                param_name = param['name']
                if param_name not in added_params:
                    parameters.append(param)
                    added_params.add(param_name)

            # The remaining code stays the same
            # ...
            
            path[method.lower()] = operation
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```
