The bug in the `get_openapi_path` function is likely due to the duplication of parameter IDs when used with dependencies. This is causing the OpenAPI schema to contain duplicated parameters, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the parameters are not duplicated and that the OpenAPI schema is generated correctly. This can be achieved by carefully handling the route parameters and dependencies to avoid duplications.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            parameters.extend(operation_parameters)
            if parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = parameters

            # Rest of the code remains unchanged

            path[method.lower()] = operation
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

This corrected code should avoid the duplication of parameters in the OpenAPI schema. However, it's important to thoroughly test this code to ensure that it resolves the issue without introducing any new problems.
