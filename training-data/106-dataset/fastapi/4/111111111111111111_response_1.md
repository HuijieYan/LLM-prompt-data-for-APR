The test case creates a FastAPI application with a POST endpoint that accepts a user ID as a path parameter and has a dependency. When generating the OpenAPI schema, the user_id path parameter is duplicated, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

The error occurs due to the way dependencies are handled in the buggy `get_openapi_path` function. When a route has a dependency, the path parameters are being duplicated in the OpenAPI schema, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling dependencies and path parameters needs to be updated. The `get_openapi_path` function should handle dependencies and path parameters without duplicating them.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
# Also include necessary imports based on the existing code

def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            
            # Handle dependencies
            # Example: Skip the duplicate path parameter if it's a dependency
            if route.dependant.dependencies:
                dependant_param_names = {
                    param.alias
                    for dependency in route.dependant.dependencies
                    for param in dependency.call.params
                }
                all_route_params = [
                    param for param in get_openapi_params(route.dependant) if param.alias not in dependant_param_names
                ]
            else:
                all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            if operation_parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = operation_parameters
            
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

In this updated code, we have added the logic to handle dependencies and avoid duplicating path parameters. This should resolve the issue of duplicate parameters in the OpenAPI schema.

After making these changes, the test case should pass without any assertion errors, and the application should generate the correct OpenAPI schema.
