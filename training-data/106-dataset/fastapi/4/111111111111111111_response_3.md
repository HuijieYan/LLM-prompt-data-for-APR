The error presents itself as a duplication of parameters in the OpenAPI schema when using dependencies. This suggests a problem with how the parameters are being handled and generated in the OpenAPI schema.

Upon analyzing the code, the issue seems to stem from the loop where the parameters for the operation are being constructed. This loop should check for duplicates and handle them appropriately.

The error occurs because the for loop where parameters are being generated does not check for duplicates. Therefore, when a parameter is added to the parameters list, it doesn't check for its presence and ends up adding duplicate parameters.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to ensure that it checks for duplicate parameters before adding them to the list. We can use a set to keep track of parameter names and check against it before adding a new parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            if operation_security:
                operation.setdefault("security", []).extend(operation_security)
            if security_definitions:
                security_schemes.update(security_definitions)
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            
            # Check for duplicate parameters before adding
            param_names = set()
            for param in operation_parameters:
                if param['name'] not in param_names:
                    parameters.append(param)
                    param_names.add(param['name'])

            if parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = parameters
                # ... rest of the code ...
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

With this modification, the `get_openapi_path` function now checks for duplicate parameters before adding them to the list. This should prevent the duplication of parameters in the OpenAPI schema and resolve the issue reported in the test case and GitHub issue.
