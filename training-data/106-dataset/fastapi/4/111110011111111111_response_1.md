The bug seems to be located in the `get_openapi_path` function. The function is intended to generate an OpenAPI schema, but it is duplicating parameter IDs when used with dependencies.

The issue is likely due to duplicate parameter entries being created in the "parameters" list for the same "user_id" path parameter.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to modify the logic for adding parameters to the operation. Instead of directly adding each parameter to the list, we can maintain a set of parameter names and only add a parameter if it is not already present in the set.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type

    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            param_names = set()  # To store the names of parameters

            # Rest of the code remains the same up to the section where "parameters" are being processed

            # Modify the logic for adding parameters to avoid duplication
            if all_route_params:
                for param in all_route_params:
                    if param.name not in param_names:
                        parameters.append(get_openapi_operation_parameter(param))
                        param_names.add(param.name)

            # Rest of the code remains the same

    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

In this corrected version, a set `param_names` is used to keep track of the parameter names already added to the `parameters` list. Before adding a new parameter, the code checks if the name is already present in the set. If not, the parameter is added, and its name is added to the set to prevent duplicates.

This should resolve the issue of duplicate parameter IDs in the OpenAPI schema.
