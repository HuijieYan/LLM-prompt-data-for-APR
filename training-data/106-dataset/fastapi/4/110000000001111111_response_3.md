This bug occurs when the openapi schema is generated and duplicate parameter IDs are added when using dependencies.

The issue arises because the "parameters" list in the operation dictionary is being appended with the same parameters for each route method. This results in duplicated parameter IDs in the OpenAPI schema.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the "parameters" list is cleared before adding parameters for each route method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function:

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            # Clear the parameters list before adding new parameters
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            
            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

            if parameters:
                operation["parameters"] = parameters

            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

            path[method.lower()] = operation
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

With this correction, the "parameters" list will be cleared before adding new parameters for each route method, preventing the duplication of parameter IDs in the OpenAPI schema.
