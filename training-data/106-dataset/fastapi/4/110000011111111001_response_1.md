Potential Bug Location:
The bug is likely to be in the following section of the get_openapi_path function:
response.setdefault("content", {}).setdefault(route_response_media_type or "application/json", {})["schema"] = response_schema

Reason for Bug:
The bug is occurring due to the incorrect handling of response content in the get_openapi_path function. There seems to be a mismatch in the response schema construction that is causing the assertion error in the test case.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the construction of the response schema and ensure that it aligns with the expected structure.
2. Verify the use of setdefault function for constructing the response content to avoid any potential overriding of values.
3. Ensure that the response schema is constructed appropriately for the specific response status codes.

Corrected Code:

```python

    *, route: routing.APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:

    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}

    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"

    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)

                    field = route.response_fields.get(additional_status_code)
                    if field:

                        response.setdefault("content", {}).setdefault(

                        )["schema"] = response_schema

                    ) or http.client.responses.get(int(additional_status_code))
                    response.setdefault(
                        "description", status_text or "Additional Response"
                    )
                    status_code_key = str(additional_status_code).upper()
                    if status_code_key == "DEFAULT":
                        status_code_key = "default"
                    operation.setdefault("responses", {})[status_code_key] = response
            # remaining code ...
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
