The error seems to be caused by the duplication of the "user_id" parameter in the OpenAPI schema due to the dependency definition in the POST endpoint.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `get_openapi_path` function, specifically the part where the request parameters are processed. When the dependencies are included in a route, the request parameters from the dependencies should not be duplicated in the OpenAPI schema.

The corrected code for the `get_openapi_path` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Dict, Type, Any, List, Optional
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def get_openapi_path(
    *, route: APIRoute, model_name_map: Dict[Type, str]
) -> Tuple[Dict, Dict, Dict]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    assert route.response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = route.response_class.media_type
    if route.include_in_schema:
        for method in route.methods:
            operation = get_openapi_operation_metadata(route=route, method=method)
            parameters: List[Dict] = []
            flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(route.dependant, skip_repeats=True)
            security_definitions, operation_security = get_openapi_security_definitions(
                flat_dependant=flat_dependant
            )
            
            #... (other code remains unchanged)
            
            all_route_params = get_openapi_params(route.dependant)
            operation_parameters = get_openapi_operation_parameters(all_route_params)
            
            # Add check to avoid duplicating parameters if dependencies exist
            if not route.dependant.dependencies:
                parameters.extend(operation_parameters)
            
            #... (other code remains unchanged)
            
    return path, security_schemes, definitions
```

In this corrected code, we only add the operation parameters to the `parameters` list if the route does not have any dependencies. This change ensures that the dependent parameters are not duplicated in the OpenAPI schema.

By making this modification, the OpenAPI schema should no longer have duplicated parameter IDs when used with dependencies. This will resolve the bug, and the test case `test_reused_param` should now pass without any assertion errors.
