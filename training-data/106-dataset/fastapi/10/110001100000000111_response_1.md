The issue seems to be related to the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag not working as expected in the FastAPI framework. The `response_model_skip_defaults` flag is used to exclude default values when serializing the response model.

Looking at the code provided, the bug seems to be in the `serialize_response` function as it does not take into account the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag when serializing the response.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `serialize_response` function to consider the `skip_defaults` flag when using `jsonable_encoder` for response serialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, Field
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi.routing import Response

def serialize_response(
    response: Response,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = None,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if skip_defaults:
        return jsonable_encoder(response, include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias, skip_defaults=True)
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response, include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias, skip_defaults=False)
```

The `serialize_response` function now takes into account the `skip_defaults` flag and passes it to the `jsonable_encoder` function for proper serialization.

You can use this corrected function to ensure that the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag works as expected in the FastAPI framework.
