The bug appears to be in the `serialize_response` function. The purpose of the function is to take a `field` and a `response` and produce a serialized response based on the `field` and the `response`.

The bug causes the function to return the full model even when `skip_defaults` is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement checking for the existence of `field` should be removed. Instead, the function should always call `jsonable_encoder` with the `response` object and the provided parameters (`include`, `exclude`, `by_alias`, `skip_defaults`).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def serialize_response(
        *,
        response: Response,
        include: Set[str] = None,
        exclude: Set[str] = set(),
        by_alias: bool = True,
        skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    return jsonable_encoder(
        response,
        include=include,
        exclude=exclude,
        by_alias=by_alias,
        skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
    )
```

With this change, the `serialize_response` function will always use the `jsonable_encoder` on the `response` object, which should correctly honor the `skip_defaults` parameter, resulting in the expected outcome.

The bug should be fixed with this change, and the associated GitHub issue can be resolved with the explanation and the corrected code.
