The bug in the provided function is likely to be in the `field.validate()` method, as it returns an empty dictionary instead of raising a validation error when the 'sub' field is missing.

The reason for the bug is that the `field` parameter is not being used correctly to validate the `response` object. Instead, the code is manually trying to extract the value and then validate it, which is not the correct approach when using a `Field` object.

To fix the bug, you should use the `field.validate()` method correctly on the `response` object and handle the validation errors properly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError, jsonable_encoder

def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: Field = None,
    response: BaseModel,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = None,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        try:
            value = field.validate(response.dict())
        except ValidationError as e:
            raise e
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            skip_defaults=skip_defaults,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response)
```

In this corrected code:
1. The `Field` object `field` is used correctly with the `validate` method on the `response` object.
2. We catch any `ValidationError` raised by the validation and re-raise it to ensure it is handled correctly.
3. The `exclude` parameter is set to `None` by default as an empty set is unnecessary in the function signature.

These changes should fix the bug and ensure that the `Field` object is used correctly for validation.
