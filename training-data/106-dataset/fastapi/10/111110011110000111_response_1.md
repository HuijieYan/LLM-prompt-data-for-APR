The bug is occurring because the `response_model_skip_defaults` flag does not seem to be working as expected. The expected behavior is that when this flag is set to True, the default values for fields should be skipped when generating the response. However, the test case is showing that the full model is being returned instead of the expected response with skipped defaults.

It seems that the issue is related to serialization of the response, and the `serialize_response` function might be the source of the problem.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `serialize_response` function honors the `skip_defaults` flag. The corrected code for the `serialize_response` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Set, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel

def serialize_response(
    response: BaseModel,
    skip_defaults: bool = False,
    response_model_skip_defaults: bool = False
) -> Any:
    if response_model_skip_defaults and skip_defaults:
        return response.dict(skip_defaults=True)
    else:
        return response.dict()
```

This corrected function takes into account both the `skip_defaults` and `response_model_skip_defaults` flags to determine whether to skip the default values when serializing the response.

After implementing this fix, the `test_return_defaults` function should pass without any assertion errors.
