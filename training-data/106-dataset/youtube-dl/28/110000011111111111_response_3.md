The error occurs in the function `_htmlentity_transform` when processing the HTML entity `'#2013266066'`. The error is raised when trying to convert the number into a character using `compat_chr(int(numstr, base))`. The error message indicates that the argument is not in the valid range.

The issue is caused by attempting to convert a very large number into a character using the `chr` function, which is not supported.

To fix this issue, instead of directly attempting to convert the number into a character, we can handle this case separately. If the number is too large to be converted into a character, we can return the original entity representation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        try:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this modification, if the number is too large to be converted into a valid character, it will return the original entity representation, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
