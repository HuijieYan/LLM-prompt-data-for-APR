Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring when the function tries to convert the HTML entity '&#2013266066;' to a character using the `compat_chr` function. The issue is caused by providing an out-of-range argument to the `compat_chr` function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect transformation of the HTML entity to a character. The function incorrectly uses the `compat_chr` function, which expects an integer value within the range of Unicode characters. However, the code does not handle the case where the HTML entity represents a character outside the valid Unicode range.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the value obtained from 'int(numstr, base)' exceeds the valid Unicode range before calling the `compat_chr` function. If it exceeds the range, handle the case accordingly.
2. Modify the implementation to follow the HTML entity decoding standards and handle out-of-range characters appropriately, such as returning the original entity representation in case of an out-of-range character.

Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected function:

```python
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    try:
        # Known non-numeric HTML entity
        if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
            return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

        mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
        if mobj is not None:
            numstr = mobj.group(1)
            if numstr.startswith('x'):
                base = 16
                numstr = '0%s' % numstr
            else:
                base = 10
            char_code = int(numstr, base)
            if char_code <= 0x10FFFF:
                return compat_chr(char_code)
            else:
                return ('&%s;' % entity)

        # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
    except ValueError:
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
