The error is occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function within the `youtube_dl.utils` module. The `ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x110000)` indicates that the `compat_chr` function is trying to convert a value outside the Unicode range.

The bug occurs when the function tries to convert a numeric HTML entity to a character using the `compat_chr` function, which is likely causing the `ValueError`. This could happen due to an incorrect conversion of the HTML entity to its corresponding character representation.

To fix this bug, the code for handling numeric HTML entities need to be modified to ensure that the conversion to characters falls within the Unicode range.

Below is the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity.startswith('&#x') or entity.startswith('&#X'):
        return chr(int(entity[3:-1], 16))
    elif entity.startswith('&#'):
        return chr(int(entity[2:-1]))
    else:
        return entity
```

In the corrected code:
- We use the `chr` function to convert the numeric HTML entity directly to its corresponding character representation.
- We check for both hexadecimal and decimal numeric entities using the `startswith` function to parse the entity appropriately.
- If the entity doesn't match the numeric pattern, we return the original entity.
