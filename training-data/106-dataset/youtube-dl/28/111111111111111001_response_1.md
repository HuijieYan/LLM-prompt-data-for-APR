The error message indicates that there is a ValueError occurring in the `_htmlentity_transform` function when the input is `'#2013266066'`. The reason behind this error is that the provided number is too large to be represented as a character, causing the `chr()` function to throw a ValueError.

To fix this bug, a check should be added to ensure that the input number does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented as a character.

Here's the corrected code for the `_htmlentity_transform` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    # Known non-numeric HTML entity
    if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint:
        return compat_chr(compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity])

    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        if numstr.startswith('x'):
            base = 16
            numstr = '0%s' % numstr
        else:
            base = 10
        
        # Check if the number is within the valid range for a character
        if int(numstr, base) <= 0x10FFFF:
            return compat_chr(int(numstr, base))
        else:
            return ('&%s;' % entity)

    # Unknown entity in name, return its literal representation
    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

With this correction, the function will check if the number obtained from the HTML entity falls within the valid range of characters before converting it. If the number is too large, it will return the HTML entity representation instead.
