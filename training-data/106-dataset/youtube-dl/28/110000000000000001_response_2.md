Potential error location: The potential error location is in the `if entity in compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` section and also in the `return ('&%s;' % entity)` section. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The code is referencing `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint` without importing or defining `compat_html_entities`, so it will result in a NameError.
2. The return statement `'&%s;' % entity` is not properly formatted and should be returning the special character represented by the entity.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import or define `compat_html_entities` in the function to avoid the NameError.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the KeyError when trying to access `compat_html_entities.name2codepoint[entity]`.
3. Use a library or function to parse and decode HTML entities.

Corrected code:
```python
import html

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    try:
        return html.unescape(entity)
    except KeyError:
        return ('&%s;' % entity)
```
