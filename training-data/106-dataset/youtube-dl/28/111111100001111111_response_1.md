The bug occurs because the function `_htmlentity_transform()` is using the `compat_chr()` function to convert the integer value to a character. The issue is that this is causing a `ValueError` when the integer value is out of range for the `unichr()` function. This is likely due to the fact that the function is accepting large numbers as input, which exceeds the range of valid Unicode characters.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conversion method to handle large numbers. One possible approach is to use Python's `chr()` function, which has a higher limit for input values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_htmlentity_transform()`:

```python
import re
import html.entities

def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    """Transforms an HTML entity to a character."""
    if entity in html.entities.name2codepoint:
        return chr(html.entities.name2codepoint[entity])
    
    mobj = re.match(r'#(x[0-9a-fA-F]+|[0-9]+)', entity)
    if mobj is not None:
        numstr = mobj.group(1)
        base = 16 if numstr.startswith('x') else 10
        return chr(int(numstr, base))

    return ('&%s;' % entity)
```

In the corrected code, we first import the `html.entities` module to access the `name2codepoint` dictionary. Then, we replace the `compat_chr()` function with the standard `chr()` function, which can handle larger input values. With this modification, the function should be able to handle the large numeric values without causing a `ValueError`.
