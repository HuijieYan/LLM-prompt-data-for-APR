The error occurs because the function cli_bool_option assumes that the param value is always a bool, but it is not always the case. In the failing test case, the param value is None because it is not present in the params dictionary. This causes the assertion error when the function tries to check if param is a bool.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function to handle the case where the param value is not present in the params dictionary. Additionally, you can add a default value for the param variable in case it is not found in the params dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the cli_bool_option function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # default value if param is not found
    if param is not None:
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
    else:
        return []

```

With this modification, the function will handle the case when the param value is not present in the params dictionary, and it will not cause an assertion error.
