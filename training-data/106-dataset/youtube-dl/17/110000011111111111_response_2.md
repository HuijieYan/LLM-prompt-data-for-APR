The bug occurs in the `cli_bool_option` function. The issue is caused by the `isinstance(param, bool)` assertion, which assumes that the `param` variable will always be of type bool. However, this is not the case, as the `param` variable is retrieved from the `params` dictionary, and it could be of a different type.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `param` exists in the `params` dictionary, and then determine its type. If the `param` is not found in the `params` dictionary, the function should return an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    if param in params:
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if params[param] else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if params[param] else false_value]
    else:
        return []
```

With this update, the function will first check if the `param` exists in the `params` dictionary. If it does, it will perform the necessary operations based on the type of the value. If the `param` is not found in the dictionary, it will return an empty list.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the function works as expected for the provided test cases.
