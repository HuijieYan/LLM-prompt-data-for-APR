Potential error location: The error occurs at the line "param = params.get(param)" in the function "cli_bool_option" in the file "utils.py" as it is trying to get the value of the parameter "nocheckcertificate" from the dictionary "params" which is not defined properly.

Reason behind the bug: The function is trying to access the value of "nocheckcertificate" from the "params" dictionary, but the dictionary "params" is either empty or does not contain the key "nocheckcertificate".

Approach for fixing the bug: Before accessing the value of "nocheckcertificate" from the "params" dictionary, we need to check if the key exists in the dictionary or not. If it does not exist, we can assume the default value to be False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param, False)  # Get the value of the param with a default value of False if key does not exist
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator:
        return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```
In the corrected code, we added a default value of False for the "nocheckcertificate" key in the "params" dictionary using the "get" method, so that even if the key is not present in the dictionary, it'll return False. This modification ensures that the function works as expected and does not throw an AssertionError.
