Looking at the provided function and the test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the function `cli_bool_option` where the parameter `param` is expected to be of type `bool`, but it is actually a string in the input. The function also doesn't handle cases where the `param` value is False along with a separator being provided.

The possible reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The function expects the `param` value to be a boolean, but it's actually a string in the provided input.
2. The function does not handle cases where the `param` value is False along with a separator being provided.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `cli_bool_option` to handle both cases of string and boolean values for the `param`, and handle cases where a separator is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    if separator:
        if isinstance(param, bool):
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param else false_value)]
        else:
            return [command_option + separator + (param if param else false_value)]
    else:
        if isinstance(param, bool):
            return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
        else:
            return [command_option, param if param else false_value]
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle both string and boolean values for the `param`, as well as cases where a separator is provided.
