The buggy function `cli_bool_option` is supposed to take in several parameters and return a list of values based on the condition of the `param` variable. However, there are a few issues with the function:

1. The function assumes that the `param` variable will always be a boolean, but this is not necessarily true. It takes the value of `params.get(param)`, which could be any type.
2. The function also checks for the existence of a `separator`, but the logic for using the separator is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Remove the assertion `assert isinstance(param, bool)` as it restricts the function to only work with boolean values.
2. Modify the logic to construct the return value based on the presence of `separator`. If a `separator` is provided, the function should use it to construct the return value. If not, it should simply return the list of values.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param_value = params.get(param)
    if param_value is not None:
        if separator:
            return [command_option + separator + (true_value if param_value else false_value)]
        return [command_option, true_value if param_value else false_value]
    return []
```

With these changes, the function will handle different types of `param` values and construct the return value based on the presence of `separator`.
