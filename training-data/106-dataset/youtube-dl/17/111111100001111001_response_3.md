The buggy function `cli_bool_option` is supposed to return a list with the command option and the corresponding true/false value based on the input parameters. However, the current implementation does not handle the cases with separators correctly.

The potential error location is the if statement that checks if `separator` is not None. If the separator is provided, it appends the command option and the corresponding true/false value using the separator, otherwise it appends the command option and the true/false value as separate elements in a list.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the condition `param` is either true or false, but it does not handle the cases with separators properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the if statement to correctly handle the cases with separators by checking the value of the `param` and including the separator when building the output list.

Here's the corrected code for the `cli_bool_option` function:

```python
def cli_bool_option(params, command_option, param, true_value='true', false_value='false', separator=None):
    param = params.get(param)
    assert isinstance(param, bool)
    if separator is not None:
        return [f"{command_option}{separator}{true_value}" if param else f"{command_option}{separator}{false_value}"]
    return [command_option, true_value if param else false_value]
```

In the corrected code, we use an f-string to properly construct the output list based on the value of `param` and the provided separator. This will handle the cases with separators correctly.
