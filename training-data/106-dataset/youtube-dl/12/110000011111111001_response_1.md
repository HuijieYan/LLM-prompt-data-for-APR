The error occurs because the `_build_format_filter` function is not correctly processing the filter specification provided in the test cases. The function is not handling the different filter operators like '=' and '!=' correctly.

The bug occurs due to incorrect parsing and handling of filter specifications in the `_build_format_filter` function. The function fails to correctly identify and apply the filter operators, leading to incorrect format selection.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
1. The function should correctly parse the filter specification and identify the operator and comparison value.
2. For each filter operator (e.g., '=', '!=', '^=', '$=', '*='), the function should apply the corresponding comparison logic to filter the formats accordingly.
3. Additionally, the function should handle invalid filter specifications gracefully and raise appropriate errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    def _filter(f):
        return self._test_format_with_filter(f, filter_spec)
    return _filter

def _test_format_with_filter(self, f, filter_spec):
    operator, value = filter_spec.split('=')
    if operator == 'format_id':
        return f.get('format_id') == value
    elif operator == 'ext':
        return f.get('ext') == value
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification: %s' % filter_spec)
```

In the corrected code, the `_build_format_filter` function returns a filter based on the filter specification. The `_test_format_with_filter` function then tests the format against the filter specification based on the operator and value. If the operator is 'format_id' or 'ext', it applies the corresponding comparison logic and returns the result. Otherwise, it raises a ValueError for an invalid filter specification.
