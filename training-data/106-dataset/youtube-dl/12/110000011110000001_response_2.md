The error occurs when the `format_selector` function in the `process_video_result` method tries to select a format that is not available, resulting in the `ExtractorError` with the message "requested format not available."

The potential error location within the `_build_format_filter` function is the handling of the string operators (`^=`, `$=`, `*=`) which is not complete and is giving rise to potential undetected errors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the string operators in the `filter_spec` are not being parsed correctly, and as a result, the correct comparison function is not being assigned to the `op` variable.

To fix the bug, the `_build_format_filter` function needs to properly handle the string operators and assign the correct comparison function to the `op` variable for string comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    # ... (existing code)

    if not m:
        # ... (existing code)
        if m:
            comparison_value = m.group('value')
            str_op = STR_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
            if m.group('negation'):
                op = lambda attr, value: not str_op(attr, value)
            else:
                op = lambda attr, value: str_op(attr, value)

    if not m:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)

    def _filter(f):
        if m.group('key') in f:
            actual_value = f[m.group('key')]
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
        return m.group('none_inclusive')

    return _filter
```
This corrected code properly handles the string operators and assigns the correct comparison function to the `op` variable for string comparison.
