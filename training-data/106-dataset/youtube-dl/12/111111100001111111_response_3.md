The issue is with the function `_build_format_filter`, where it is not correctly identifying the comparison operator and value from the `filter_spec` input. The function is designed to handle different comparison operators and compare them with the format attributes, but it fails to do so in its current state. This can lead to incorrect format filtering when used in the context of YouTubeDL.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the comparison operator and value from the `filter_spec` input and applies the appropriate comparison operation when filtering the formats.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "
    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    m = re.match(r'(?P<key>\w+)(?P<op>[<>=!]=?)(?P<value>.*)', filter_spec)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        value = m.group('value')

        if op in OPERATORS:
            op_func = OPERATORS[op]

            def _filter(f):
                actual_value = f.get(key)
                if actual_value is None:
                    return False
                return op_func(actual_value, value)

            return _filter

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification: {}'.format(filter_spec))
```

In the corrected code, the `re.match` function is used to identify the key, operator, and value from the `filter_spec`. It then checks if the operator is valid and applies the corresponding comparison function to filter the formats.

This correction addresses the issues in the original function and ensures that the format filtering is performed correctly.
