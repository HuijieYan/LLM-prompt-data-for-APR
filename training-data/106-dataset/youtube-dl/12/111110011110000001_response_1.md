The test case is testing the format selection using string operators such as '=', '!=', '^=', '$=', and '*='. The error message indicates that the requested format is not available.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_filter` function returned by the `_build_format_filter` method. The format filtering logic inside the `_filter` function seems to be incorrect, causing the issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be an incorrect implementation of the format filtering logic within the `_build_format_filter` method. The format filtering is not accurately checking and matching the formats based on the specified filter_spec.

To fix the bug, the format filtering logic needs to be corrected so that it accurately filters the formats based on the filter_spec provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
        " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "
    
        # Existing code here...
    
        def _filter(f):
            if m:
                actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
                if actual_value is None:
                    return bool(m.group('none_inclusive'))
                return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
            elif str_operator_rex:
                actual_value = f.get(m.group('key'))
                if actual_value is None:
                    return bool(m.group('none_inclusive'))
                return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
            else:
                raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)

        # ... omitted code ...
```

In the corrected code, the if-elif-else conditions have been properly modified to handle the matching of filter specifications based on different cases. Additionally, the return statement has been updated to return the result of comparing the actual_value with the comparison_value.

This correction should address the bug in the `_build_format_filter` method and ensure that the format filtering works as intended.
