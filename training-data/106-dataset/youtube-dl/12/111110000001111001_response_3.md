The buggy function `_build_format_filter` is designed to return a filtering function based on the `filter_spec` passed to it. The function uses regular expressions to parse the `filter_spec` and set up corresponding comparison operations. However, the function is failing to handle cases where the filter specification includes negation or wildcard matching. This is leading to incorrect comparison operations being set up.

In the test case, the specified `filter_spec` strings include different types of comparisons like equality, inequality, starts with, ends with, and wildcard matching. The function is not dealing with these different comparison types properly, leading to incorrect comparison operations being set up for the filtering function.

To fix this, the regular expression handling for different types of comparison needs to be updated to correctly capture and differentiate between them. Additionally, the comparison operations based on the type of operator used in the `filter_spec` need to be handled properly to ensure the correct filtering function is generated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "
    
    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
        '^=': lambda attr, value: attr.startswith(value),
        '$=': lambda attr, value: attr.endswith(value),
        '*=': lambda attr, value: value in attr,
    }
    
    op = None
    comparison_value = None
    
    for operator in OPERATORS:
        if operator in filter_spec:
            key, value = filter_spec.split(operator)
            op = OPERATORS[operator]
            comparison_value = value
            break

    if op is None:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)
    
    def _filter(f):
        actual_value = f.get(key)
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
    return _filter
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over the available comparison operators and check if any of them are present in the `filter_spec`, and then split the specification to extract the key and comparison value. Based on the operator found, the corresponding comparison operation is set up. This approach ensures that different types of comparison operators are handled correctly and the filtering function is generated accurately.
