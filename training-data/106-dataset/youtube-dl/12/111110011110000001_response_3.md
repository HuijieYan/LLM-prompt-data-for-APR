The error message indicates that the requested format is not available, even though it should be based on the test case. The problematic function that needs to be fixed is the `_build_format_filter` method within the `YoutubeDL` class.

The reason behind the bug may be related to the implementation of the `_build_format_filter` method, which is responsible for filtering the formats according to the filter specification. It seems that the logic for format filtering is not functioning correctly, leading to the error in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic within the `_build_format_filter` method and ensure that it correctly filters the formats based on the given filter specifications. This may involve reorganizing the filtering conditions and enhancing the comparison and filtering process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` method:

```python
import re
import operator
from youtube_dl.utils import parse_filesize

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
        " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

        def _filter(f):
            def sanitize_value(value):
                try:
                    return int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    return parse_filesize(value)

            parts = re.findall(r'((?:[a-zA-Z_]+[=!<>]+)?\??[a-zA-Z_]+)', filter_spec)
            for part in parts:
                if part.endswith('?') and not f.get(part[:-1]):
                    return True
                elif part.endswith('='):
                    key, operator, value = re.findall(r'([a-zA-Z_]+)([=!<>]+)?(.*)', part)[0]
                    value = sanitize_value(value)
                    if operator == '=':
                        if f.get(key) != value:
                            return False
                    elif operator == '!=':
                        if f.get(key) == value:
                            return False
                    elif operator == '<':
                        if f.get(key) >= value:
                            return False
                    elif operator == '<=':
                        if f.get(key) > value:
                            return False
                    elif operator == '>':
                        if f.get(key) <= value:
                            return False
                    elif operator == '>=':
                        if f.get(key) < value:
                            return False
            return True

        return _filter
```

In this corrected code, the filter specifications are split into parts and then evaluated individually to check if they match the format attributes. The `sanitize_value` function is used to convert the comparison values to integers or parse them as file sizes. The filtering logic has been adjusted to correctly handle the comparison operators and conditions. This should help in resolving the bug and ensuring that the format filtering operates as expected.
