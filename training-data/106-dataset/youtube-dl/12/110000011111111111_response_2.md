The bug is occurring in the `_build_format_filter` function of the YoutubeDL class. The function is used to filter formats based on filter specifications. The error occurs when the format selection fails to find the requested format.

The reason for this bug could be incorrect filtering logic or issues with the comparison operators used to filter the formats based on the filter_spec input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the format selection logic correctly filters the formats based on the provided filter specification.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    # Comparison operators definition
    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
        '^=': lambda attr, value: attr.startswith(value),
        '$=': lambda attr, value: attr.endswith(value),
        '*=': lambda attr, value: value in attr,
    }
    
    def _filter(f):
        for op, fn in OPERATORS.items():
            if op in filter_spec:
                key, value = filter_spec.split(op)
                actual_value = f.get(key)
                if actual_value is not None:
                    if op in ('^=', '$=', '*='):
                        return fn(actual_value, value)
                    else:
                        try:
                            comparison_value = int(value)
                        except ValueError:
                            comparison_value = value
                        return fn(actual_value, comparison_value)
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification %r' % filter_spec)
    
    return _filter
```

In the corrected function, we have simplified the logic to filter formats based on the filter specification. The comparison operators are now implemented directly within the `_filter` function, ensuring that the correct comparison is made based on the filter specification.

Please note that the corrected code assumes the availability of certain values and keys in the input data structure, and it may need to be adapted based on the complete data structure and requirements.
