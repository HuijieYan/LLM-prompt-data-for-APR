The error message indicates that the "requested format not available" in the test_format_selection_string_ops test case. This suggests that the _build_format_filter function, responsible for filtering the formats, may be causing the issue.

The potential error in the function is that it does not properly handle the comparison and filtering of formats based on the specified criteria such as format_id, width, height, etc.

The reason behind the bug is that the filtering logic in the _build_format_filter function is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect filtering of the formats based on the provided filter specifications.

To fix the bug, the _build_format_filter function needs to be rewritten with proper handling of the comparison operators and filtering logic based on the filter_spec provided.

Here's the corrected code for the _build_format_filter function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    def _filter(f):
        key, op, value = re.match(r'(\w+)([<>=!]+)(.*)', filter_spec).groups()
        if op == '<':
            return f.get(key) < value
        elif op == '<=':
            return f.get(key) <= value
        elif op == '>':
            return f.get(key) > value
        elif op == '>=':
            return f.get(key) >= value
        elif op == '=':
            return f.get(key) == value
        elif op == '!=':
            return f.get(key) != value
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid comparison operator in format specification %r' % filter_spec)

    return _filter
```

This corrected function properly parses the filter_spec and compares the format attributes based on the specified operators.
