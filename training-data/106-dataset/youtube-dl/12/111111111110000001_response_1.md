The bug seems to be occurring in the `process_video_result` function. The error message indicates that the requested format is not available. This can be due to the incorrect implementation of format filtering in the `_build_format_filter` function.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect implementation of the `_build_format_filter` function that filters the formats according to the filter_spec. The function appears to have incorrectly implemented filtering logic, which is causing the wrong formats to be selected.

To fix the bug, the filtering logic in the `_build_format_filter` function needs to be corrected to ensure that the correct formats are selected based on the filter_spec provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

    OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    def _filter(f):
        if 'format_id' in filter_spec:
            return f.get('format_id', '') == filter_spec['format_id']
        elif 'ext' in filter_spec:
            return f.get('ext', '') == filter_spec['ext']
        elif 'url' in filter_spec:
            return f.get('url', '') == filter_spec['url']
        else:
            return True  # No filter, so return True for all formats

    return _filter
```

In this corrected implementation, the `_build_format_filter` function now correctly filters the formats based on the provided filter_spec. It checks for the presence of keys such as 'format_id', 'ext', and 'url' in the filter_spec and filters the formats accordingly. If no filter is specified, it returns all formats.
