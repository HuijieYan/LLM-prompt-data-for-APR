The test case `test_format_selection_string_ops` is trying to filter formats based on certain conditions like format_id, such as equals (`=`), does not equal (`!=`), starts with (`^=`), ends with (`$=`), and contains (`*=`). The test case is failing with the error message 'requested format not available'. This indicates that the function `_build_format_filter` is not correctly filtering the formats based on the conditions provided.

The potential error location within the `_build_format_filter` function is the implementation of filtering the formats based on different conditions specified in the test case.

The bug most likely occurs due to incorrect filtering conditions being set up within the function. This may be due to incorrect comparison values. Additionally, some filtering condition may not be correctly identified and applied based on the format specification.

To fix this bug, the function `_build_format_filter` should correctly parse the provided filter specification and apply the corresponding filtering conditions to the formats. By ensuring that the correct comparison values are used and identifying the filtering condition based on the format specification, the bug can be addressed.

Based on the analysis, the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function can be as follows:


```python
import operator
import re

class YoutubeDL:
    def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
        " Returns a function to filter the formats according to the filter_spec "

        def _filter(f):
            match = re.match(r'\[([\w_]+)(?P<op>[<>=!$*^]+)(?P<value>[\w-]+)\]', filter_spec)
            if match:
                key = match.group(1)
                op = match.group('op')
                value = match.group('value')

                actual_value = f.get(key)
                if actual_value is None:
                    return False

                if op == '=':
                    return actual_value == value
                elif op == '!=':
                    return actual_value != value
                elif op == '^=':
                    return actual_value.startswith(value)
                elif op == '$=':
                    return actual_value.endswith(value)
                elif op == '*=':
                    return value in actual_value
            return False

        return _filter

# Rest of the code for operator, re and other supporting utility functions if used are not included for brevity
```

In the corrected implementation, the function now correctly parses the filter specification provided and applies the corresponding filtering conditions to the formats. This should resolve the bug encountered in the test case.
