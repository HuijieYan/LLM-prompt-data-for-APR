The error occurs because the `_build_format_filter` function is not correctly processing the `filter_spec`. The function fails to build the format filter correctly based on the provided `filter_spec`, which leads to the error of the requested format not being available.

The potential error location within the code is in the parsing and application of the `filter_spec` to filter the formats.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Split the `filter_spec` string to extract the format filter components (e.g., format_id, operators).
- Implement separate logic for different operators, such as equals, not equals, starts with, ends with, etc.
- Handle the different operations on the format attributes properly according to the filter specifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` function:

```python
def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Split filter_spec string to extract format filter components
    filter_components = filter_spec.split('=')
    key = filter_components[0]
    value = filter_components[1]

    def _filter(f):
        actual_value = f.get(key)
        
        if '*' in value:
            # Implement logic for contains (*=)
            return value[:-2] in actual_value
        
        if '^' in value:
            # Implement logic for starts with (^=)
            return actual_value.startswith(value[2:])
        
        if '$' in value:
            # Implement logic for ends with ($=)
            return actual_value.endswith(value[2:])
        
        if '!=' in value:
            # Implement logic for not equals (!=)
            return actual_value != value[2:]
        
        # Implement logic for equals (=)
        return actual_value == value

    return _filter
```

This corrected function properly handles different filter specifications using operators like equals, not equals, starts with, ends with, and contains. This should address the issues observed in the test case and the error message.
