The error seems to be occurring in the `_build_format_filter` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. This method is responsible for building a filter function based on the `filter_spec` provided, which is used for filtering formats. The error message indicates that the requested format is not available.

The potential error location within the code is that the `format_selector` may not be correctly filtering the formats based on the `filter_spec`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the filter condition in the `_build_format_filter` method is not correctly handling the `filter_spec` provided, resulting in incorrect format selection.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the filter conditions for the different parts of the `filter_spec` are correctly implemented to accurately filter the formats.

Below is the corrected code for the `_build_format_filter` method:

```python
import operator
import re

class YoutubeDL:
    def _build_format_filter(self, filter_spec):
        OPERATORS = {
            '<': operator.lt,
            '<=': operator.le,
            '>': operator.gt,
            '>=': operator.ge,
            '=': operator.eq,
            '!=': operator.ne,
        }
        
        m = re.match(r'([a-zA-Z_]+)([<>=!]{1,2})([a-zA-Z0-9.-_]+)', filter_spec)
        
        if m:
            key = m.group(1)
            op = m.group(2)
            value = m.group(3)
            op_func = OPERATORS.get(op)
            
            if op_func:
                def _filter(f):
                    actual_value = f.get(key)
                    if actual_value is None:
                        return False
                    return op_func(actual_value, value)
                return _filter
            else:
                raise ValueError('Invalid operator: %s' % op)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid filter specification: %s' % filter_spec)
```

In the corrected code:
- The regex pattern is used to match the `filter_spec` and extract the key, operator, and value.
- The matched parts are then used to build the filter function, which checks if the actual value in the format dictionary satisfies the condition specified in the `filter_spec`.

This should fix the bug in the `_build_format_filter` method.
