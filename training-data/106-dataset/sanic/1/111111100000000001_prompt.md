Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python

# relative function's signature in this file
def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
