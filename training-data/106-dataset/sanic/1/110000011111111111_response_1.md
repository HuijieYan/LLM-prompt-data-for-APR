The bug is likely in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the part where middleware is being added to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary.

The bug causes the named response middleware to be added in the wrong order, resulting in the incorrect execution order when handling the response.

The bug can be fixed by using `appendleft()` to add the middleware to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary, which will ensure that the middleware is added in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
from collections import deque

def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

With this correction, the named response middleware should now be executed in the correct order based on their addition to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary. This should resolve the issue and the test case should now pass successfully.
