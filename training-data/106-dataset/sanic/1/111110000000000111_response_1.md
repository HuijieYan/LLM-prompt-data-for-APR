The issue mentioned is related to the usage of "named response middleware" in the Sanic framework. The bug is located in the `register_named_middleware` function of the `Sanic` class.

The bug occurs because when registering a "response" middleware, the middleware should be added to the left in reverse, but the code incorrectly uses `append` instead of `appendleft`, which is causing the named response middleware to execute in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when attaching the middleware to the named response middleware.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

By using `appendleft` instead of `append`, the named response middleware will be added in reverse order, as expected.
