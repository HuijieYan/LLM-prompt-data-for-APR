The bug in the provided function is that it does not check if the route is already in the middleware deque before adding it. This can cause unnecessary duplication of the same middleware function in the deque. 

The potential error location is the code block where the middleware is appended to the deque without checking if it already exists. This occurs in both the "request" and "response" branches of the conditional statement.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the middleware is not already in the deque before adding it. If it already exists, then there is no need to add it again.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
