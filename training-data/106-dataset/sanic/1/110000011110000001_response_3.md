The test case "test_bp_middleware_order" is designed to test the ordering and execution of middleware functions within a Sanic blueprint. The error message indicates that the order in which the middleware functions are executed does not match the expected order.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the "register_named_middleware" method, particularly in the logic that processes middleware registration for request and response routes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the "register_named_middleware" method does not properly handle the registration and execution order of middleware functions for request and response routes. This results in the incorrect ordering of middleware execution observed in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Separate the logic for registering and executing middleware functions for request and response routes.
2. Ensure that middleware functions are registered in the correct order and executed based on their association with request or response routes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Update to maintain the correct order for request middleware
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Update to maintain the correct order for response middleware
```

In the corrected code:
- We use "appendleft" instead of "append" to add middleware in reverse order for request and response routes, ensuring the correct order of execution.
