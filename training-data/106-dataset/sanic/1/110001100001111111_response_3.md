The bug occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the part where middleware is added to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary. The bug causes the middleware to be added using `append()` instead of `appendleft()`, which results in the middleware being executed in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `appendleft()` method to add the middleware to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary. This will ensure that the middleware is added to the left and in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

Using `appendleft()` in the `register_named_middleware` function will ensure that the named response middleware is added to the left in reverse order, fixing the bug and ensuring the correct execution order of middleware.
