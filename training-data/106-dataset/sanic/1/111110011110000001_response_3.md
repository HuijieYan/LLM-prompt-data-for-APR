The error message indicates that the order in which the middleware functions are being appended to the `order` list is incorrect, leading to a mismatch with the expected order.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue lies within the `register_named_middleware` function in the `Sanic` class. The issue stems from how the middleware is being appended to the respective lists based on the `attach_to` parameter.

The bug occurs because the middleware is being appended in the wrong order based on the given `attach_to`. For "attach_to" equal to "response", the order should be reversed while appending the middleware to the list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `register_named_middleware` function by reversing the order of appending middleware when `attach_to` is "response".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # the corrected function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):

        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":  # Use elif to explicitly differentiate between the two conditions
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Reversing the order of appending middleware for "response"
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this modification, the middleware will now be correctly appended to the respective lists based on the `attach_to` parameter, ensuring the correct order of execution when it is subsequently accessed during the middleware processing.
