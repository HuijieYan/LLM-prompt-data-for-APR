The error message is indicating that the order of execution for the "response" middleware is not correct. The expected order is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but the actual order is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4].

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block for attaching middleware to the "response" in the **register_named_middleware** method of the **Sanic** class. The issue seems to be with the use of the **append** method instead of **appendleft** to add middleware to the named response middleware.

The bug occurred because in the original implementation, the **register_named_middleware** function adds "response" middleware using the **append** method, which results in adding the new middleware to the right end of the deque. This causes the "response" middleware to execute in the wrong order.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the **appendleft** method to add "response" middleware, which will add the new middleware to the left end of the deque, maintaining the correct order of middleware execution.

Here's the corrected code for the **register_named_middleware** method of the **Sanic** class:

```python
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this corrected implementation, the "response" middleware will be added to the left end of the deque, ensuring that it is executed in the correct order.
