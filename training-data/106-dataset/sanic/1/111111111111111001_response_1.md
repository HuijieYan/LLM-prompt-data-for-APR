The error occurs because the order of appending the middleware functions to the named response middleware is not maintained. The functions are added in an arbitrary order instead of the order in which they are defined, causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this issue, the middleware functions should be appended to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary in the order they are defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            # Corrected code: Append the middleware at the first index (position 0) of the deque.
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`, we can ensure that the middleware functions are added to the deque in the correct order, maintaining the expected response order when the middleware is processed.
