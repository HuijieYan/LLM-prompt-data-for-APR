The error occurs when the test_bp_middleware_order function runs, and it fails with the AssertionError:
```
>       assert order == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
E       assert [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4] == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
E         At index 3 diff: 6 != 4
```
This indicates that the response middlewares are being executed in the wrong order.

The potential error location is in the register_named_middleware function, specifically in the part where "response" middleware is being added to the deque. The code currently appends the middleware, which is supposed to be added to the left in reverse order.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect use of append instead of appendleft. Instead of adding the middleware to the left of the deque, it adds it to the right.

To fix the bug, we need to use the appendleft method when attaching the "response" middleware, to ensure it is added to the left of the deque in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using the appendleft method instead of append, the response middlewares will be added to the deque in the correct reverse order.
