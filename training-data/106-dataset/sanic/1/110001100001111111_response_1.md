The buggy function `register_named_middleware` is responsible for registering named middleware in the `self.named_request_middleware` and `self.named_response_middleware` dictionaries. However, there is a bug in the code where the `append` method is used instead of the `appendleft` method when attaching middleware to the "response" context. This results in the named response middleware being executed in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to use the `appendleft` method when attaching middleware to the "response" context, ensuring that the named response middleware is added to the left in reverse order.

Here is the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this modification, the named response middleware will be added to the left in reverse order and will be executed in the correct sequence, resolving the issue with the middleware execution order.
