The bug in the provided function causes the ordering of the middleware to be incorrect when attaching middleware to the "response" phase. This results in the assertion error in the test function.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect mapping of middleware functions to the respective route names and attach_to values. The bug seems to be related to the code that handles attaching middleware to the "response" phase.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling the "response" phase should correctly update the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary with the assigned middleware functions for the given route names.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

By making the necessary changes in the conditional check for the "response" phase, the bug should be resolved. The corrected code ensures that the middleware functions are correctly added to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary for the specified route names.
