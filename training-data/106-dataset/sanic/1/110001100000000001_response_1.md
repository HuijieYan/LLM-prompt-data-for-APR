Potential error location: 

The error might be in the logic of the if-else conditions. The code checks for `attach_to` being "request" or "response," but does not handle other cases.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug could occur if `attach_to` variable does not have the value of "request" or "response." In such cases, the code does not handle it and simply does nothing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Add a condition to handle cases where `attach_to` is not "request" or "response."
2. Throw an error or log a warning for invalid values of `attach_to`.

Corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for attach_to: {}".format(attach_to))
