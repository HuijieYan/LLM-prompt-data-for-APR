The error in the `register_named_middleware` function occurs because the middleware addition logic is reversed for response middleware. The method appends new middleware to the right instead of the left when `attach_to` is "response". This results in the wrong order of execution of middleware.

To fix the bug, the code should use `appendleft` instead of `append` when `attach_to` is "response".

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this correction, the response middleware will be added to the left of the deque, ensuring the correct order of execution. This should fix the issue with the wrong order of execution of named response middleware.

After applying this correction, the test case `test_bp_middleware_order` should pass without any assertion errors.
