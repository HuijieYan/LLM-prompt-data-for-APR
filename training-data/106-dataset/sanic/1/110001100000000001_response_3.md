The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement for "attach_to".

The bug occurred because the code does not have proper indentation, making it difficult to understand its structure. Another issue is the use of the "self" parameter without it being the first parameter in the function definition.

To fix the bug, we need to properly indent the code within the function and make sure the "self" parameter is the first parameter in the function definition.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/sanic_1/sanic/app.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
