Potential error location: The error could occur within the two if statements because they are not properly nested. Both if statements are independent and could potentially execute, which contradicts the logic of attaching middleware to either the request or the response.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the logic of attaching middleware to either the request or the response. As a result, the middleware may be attached to both the request and the response, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use an if-else structure instead of two independent if statements to ensure that only one attachment (request or response) occurs.
2. Restructure the function to separate the logic for attaching middleware to the request and response, ensuring mutual exclusivity between them.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    for _rn in route_names:
        if attach_to == "request":
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
