The error occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function. The issue is that when registering a "response" middleware, the code uses `append()` instead of `appendleft()`, which results in the middleware being added to the right instead of the left in reverse.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to use `appendleft()` when registering "response" middleware in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
