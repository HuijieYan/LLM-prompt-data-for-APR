The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected `order` list and the actual `order` list, specifically at index 3.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the `register_named_middleware` method. In its current form, it is not correctly handling the insertion of middleware functions based on the `attach_to` value, which results in the incorrect order of middleware execution.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `register_named_middleware` method is not correctly differentiating between request and response middleware when adding them to the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to separate the logic for registering request and response middleware, ensuring that each middleware type is added to the correct dictionary based on the `attach_to` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    for _rn in route_names:
        if attach_to == "request":
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for registering request and response middleware has been separated, and the condition based on the `attach_to` value is used to determine which dictionary to add the middleware to. This should resolve the issue with middleware execution order.
