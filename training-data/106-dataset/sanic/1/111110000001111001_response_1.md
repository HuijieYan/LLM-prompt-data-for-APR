The bug in the provided function is that if the 'attach_to' parameter is 'response', the function only adds the middleware to the 'named_response_middleware' dictionary and does not consider the 'named_request_middleware' dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle both 'request' and 'response' cases by adding the middleware to the appropriate dictionary based on the value of 'attach_to'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # Change made here
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
