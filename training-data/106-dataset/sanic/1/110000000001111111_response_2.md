The problematic function `register_named_middleware` is not correctly adding the `middleware` to the named request and response middleware dictionaries. Additionally, for response middleware, it should be added to the left in reverse using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`.

The bug occurs because when the function is registering named request and response middleware, it is not correctly adding the middleware to the dictionaries, and for response middleware, it is not adding them in reverse order.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Add the middleware to the dictionaries for named request and response middleware.
2. For response middleware, use `appendleft()` to add the middleware to the left in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from collections import deque

def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

This corrected code should resolve the bug and ensure that named response middleware is added in the correct order.
