The error message indicates that the order of execution of the response middlewares is not as expected. This indicates that the middleware registration process is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the function is the 'if attach_to == "response"' block, where the middleware should be added to the named response middleware if it's not already present.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the middlewares for the response are not being correctly added to the named_response_middleware.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the named_response_middleware is being correctly populated with the middlewares for the response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":  # change to elif
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

The change made in the corrected code is switching the second 'if' statement to an 'elif' statement, ensuring that only one of the blocks (request or response) is executed.
