The error in the code can be located in the `register_named_middleware` function. The issue is that when registering a "response" middleware, it should be added to the left in reverse. This means that `appendleft()` should be used instead of `append()` for the named response middleware. This bug leads to the wrong order of execution for the named response middleware.

To fix the bug, simply replace `append()` with `appendleft()` in the code. This ensures that the named response middleware is added to the left in reverse order.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
from collections import deque

class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this change, the named response middleware will now be added to the left in reverse order, ensuring that it is executed in the correct sequence.
