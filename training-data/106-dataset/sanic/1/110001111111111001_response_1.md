The test case is checking the order of execution of middleware functions in a Sanic blueprint. The error message indicates that the order in which the middleware functions were executed is not as expected.

The issue seems to be with the `register_named_middleware` function, where the middleware functions are added to the `named_request_middleware` or `named_response_middleware` dictionaries based on the `attach_to` parameter.

It appears that the issue lies in the order of appending the middleware functions to the deque and in the condition checking for the presence of the middleware in the deque.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the middleware functions are added to the deque in the correct order based on the `route_names` parameter. Additionally, we need to correctly check if the middleware function is already present in the deque before appending it.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
            else:
                # Reorder the middleware by removing and re-adding
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].remove(middleware)
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
            else:
                # Reorder the middleware by removing and re-adding
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].remove(middleware)
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, after checking if the middleware is not present in the deque, an else block has been added to reorder the middleware if it is already present. This ensures that the middleware functions are added in the correct order and are not duplicated.
