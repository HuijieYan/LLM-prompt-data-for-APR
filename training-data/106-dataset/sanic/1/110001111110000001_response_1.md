The error occurs in the `test_bp_middleware_order` test function where it asserts that the `order` list should be equal to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. However, the actual order after the request is sent is different - it's `[1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]`. This indicates that the order of the middleware functions for the response is incorrect.

The potential error location is in the `register_named_middleware` method within the `Blueprint` class. The middleware functions for the response are being registered in the wrong order, causing the issue with the test case.

The reason for the bug is that when registering middleware for the response, the `register_named_middleware` function appends the middleware in the wrong order to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary. This causes them to be processed in the wrong sequence, leading to the incorrect order of execution.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `register_named_middleware` function to correctly register the middleware for both request and response.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` are appended using `appendleft` method of the `deque` class to ensure that the middleware is added to the beginning of the deque, preserving the order of execution.
