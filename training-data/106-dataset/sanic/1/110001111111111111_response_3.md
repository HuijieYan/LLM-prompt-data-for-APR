The test case `test_bp_middleware_order` sets up a Sanic application with a blueprint containing several middleware functions for both request and response. The expected order of execution for the middleware functions is specified, but the actual order does not match the expected order, resulting in a failing assertion.

The error message indicates that the response middleware functions are being executed in the wrong order, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function `register_named_middleware` lies in the logic for adding middleware to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary. The `append` method is used to add the middleware, causing the incorrect ordering.

The bug occurs because when adding middlewares to the `named_response_middleware`, the `append` method is used, which adds new middleware to the end of the deque. This causes the middleware to be executed in the wrong order when the response is processed.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be replaced with the `appendleft` method to add the middleware to the left end of the deque, thus preserving the correct order in which the middleware functions should be executed.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By making this change, the middleware will be added to the left end of the deque, ensuring that it is executed in the correct order when processing the response.
