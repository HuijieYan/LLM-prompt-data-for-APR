The error occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where middleware is added to the `named_response_middleware`. The issue is that when registering a "response" middleware, they are supposed to be added to the left in reverse, but the function currently uses `append()` instead of `appendleft()`.

To fix this bug, the `append()` method should be replaced with `appendleft()` when checking if the middleware is not already in the named_response_middleware and then adding it to the deque.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
