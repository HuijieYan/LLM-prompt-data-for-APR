The buggy function `register_named_middleware` is responsible for adding middleware to either the request or response middleware deque based on the `attach_to` parameter. The issue is with the logic for adding middleware to the respective deques.

The bug occurs due to the if-else statements not being mutually exclusive. This means that when `attach_to` is "request", it still executes the code under `attach_to == "response"` as well. This causes middleware to be added to both request and response deques, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic should be adjusted to ensure that only the relevant block of code is executed based on the value of `attach_to`.

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    for _rn in route_names:
        if attach_to == "request":
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

By reorganizing the if-else statements and removing the redundant conditional checks, the corrected function ensures that middleware is only added to the relevant deque based on the value of `attach_to`.
