The error message indicates that the named response middleware is being executed in the wrong order. This implies that there is an issue with the order in which the middleware is being appended to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary.

The potential error location within the `register_named_middleware` function is at the point where middleware is appended to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary. The bug occurs because the middleware is being appended using the `append()` method, which adds the item to the end of the list, instead of `appendleft()` method, which adds the item to the beginning of the list.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to use the `appendleft()` method to add the middleware to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code with the fix:

```python
# corrected register_named_middleware function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

The corrected code uses `appendleft()` instead of `append()` when adding middleware to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary, ensuring that the named response middleware is executed in the correct order.
