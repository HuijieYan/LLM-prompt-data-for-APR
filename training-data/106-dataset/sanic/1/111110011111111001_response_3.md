The error message from the test function indicates that the order of execution for the response middleware functions is not as expected. This suggests that the `register_named_middleware` function, which handles the registration of middleware, might have an issue in maintaining the order of registered middleware or handling them incorrectly.

The potential error location within the `register_named_middleware` function is in the logic for registering middleware for both "request" and "response" types. The middlewares are appended to a deque for each route name, but the ordering might not be guaranteed or consistently maintained.

The bug occurs because the logic for registering middleware does not consider maintaining the order of middleware properly, especially for response middleware.

To fix the bug in the `register_named_middleware` function, the function should maintain the order of middleware by inserting the new middleware at the appropriate position in the deque.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
class Sanic():
    def __init__(self):
        self.named_request_middleware = {}
        self.named_response_middleware = {}

    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    # Insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

In the corrected code, the `appendleft` method of `deque` is used to insert the new middleware at the beginning of the deque, effectively maintaining the order of execution for the middlewares.
