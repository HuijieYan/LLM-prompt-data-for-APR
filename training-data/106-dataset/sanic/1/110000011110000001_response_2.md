The error message indicates that the order of middleware execution is not as expected. The bug is likely located in the `register_named_middleware` function, where the middleware is not being attached to the correct route or request type.

The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly attaching the middleware to the respective request and response routes. As a result, the order in which the middleware functions are called is incorrect, leading to the failed test case.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function needs to correctly attach the middleware to the specified route names and request types.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Change .append to .appendleft to maintain the correct order of middleware
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Change .append to .appendleft to maintain the correct order of middleware
```

With these changes, the middleware will be attached to the request and response routes in the correct order, leading to the successful execution of the test case.
