The bug occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function. When registering a "response" middleware, the `append()` method is used to add the middleware, but it should be `appendleft()` to ensure that the middleware is added in reverse.

The bug causes the named response middleware to be executed in the wrong order, leading to the test failure. Instead of the desired order of execution [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the actual execution order is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4].

To fix the bug, the `append()` method should be replaced with `appendleft()` when attaching middleware to the "response" context.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Fixed: Use appendleft() instead of append()
```

By making this change, the named response middleware will be added in reverse order, ensuring that they are executed in the correct sequence.
