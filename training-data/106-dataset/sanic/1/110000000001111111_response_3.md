The issue is with the `register_named_middleware` function, where the `append` method is used instead of `appendleft` when attaching middleware to the named response middleware. This causes the middleware to be added in the wrong order, resulting in the incorrect execution sequence.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when `attach_to` is "response".

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

This corrected code ensures that when attaching named response middleware, the middleware will be added to the left in reverse order, as intended.
