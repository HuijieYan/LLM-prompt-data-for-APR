The bug in the `register_named_middleware` function is that when registering a "response" middleware, the middleware should be added to the left in reverse order using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`.

The reason for this bug is that the incorrect method (`append()`) is used to add middleware to the deque, resulting in the middleware being added to the right instead of the left in reverse order.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `append()` with `appendleft()` when adding middleware to the deque for "response" middleware.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft() for "response" middleware
```
