Potential Error:
The issue with the current `register_named_middleware` function is that it does not handle the case when `attach_to` is neither "request" nor "response".

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function only considers two specific cases for the `attach_to` parameter ("request" and "response"), leading to incorrect behavior when a different value is provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can add a condition to handle the case when `attach_to` is neither "request" nor "response". This can be done by raising a ValueError or implementing a default behavior for such cases.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid value for attach_to: {}".format(attach_to))
```
