Potential error location:
The error might occur when trying to access the dictionary `self.named_request_middleware` and `self.named_response_middleware` because they have not been initialized before using them.

Reasons behind the bug:
The dictionary `self.named_request_middleware` and `self.named_response_middleware` are not initialized before being accessed. This can lead to a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the dictionaries `self.named_request_middleware` and `self.named_response_middleware` before using them.
2. Check if the key exists in the dictionary before using it to avoid KeyError.

Corrected code:
```python
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if not hasattr(self, 'named_request_middleware'):
            self.named_request_middleware = {}
        if not hasattr(self, 'named_response_middleware'):
            self.named_response_middleware = {}

        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
