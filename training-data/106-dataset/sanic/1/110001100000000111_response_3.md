Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the use of `append` instead of `appendleft` when registering "response" middleware. This causes the named response middleware to be executed in the wrong order.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the wrong method is used to add the middleware to the deque. The named response middleware should be added to the left in reverse, which requires using `appendleft` instead of `append`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The fix involves replacing `append` with `appendleft` when adding named response middleware to the deque. This ensures that the middleware is executed in the correct order.

Corrected code:
```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Fixed to use appendleft instead of append
```
