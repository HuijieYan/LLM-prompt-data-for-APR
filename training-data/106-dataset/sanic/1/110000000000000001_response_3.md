Potential error location: The error may occur in the if statements that check if the route name is not already in the middleware dictionary before adding the middleware.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not checking for the existence of the named_request_middleware and named_response_middleware dictionaries before trying to access them.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if the named_request_middleware and named_response_middleware dictionaries exist and create them if they don't.
2. Use defaultdict from the collections module to automatically create a deque when a key does not exist in the dictionary.

Corrected code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        if not hasattr(self, 'named_request_middleware'):
            self.named_request_middleware = defaultdict(deque)
        for _rn in route_names:
            self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        if not hasattr(self, 'named_response_middleware'):
            self.named_response_middleware = defaultdict(deque)
        for _rn in route_names:
            self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
