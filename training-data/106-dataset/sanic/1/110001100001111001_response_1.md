Potential error location: The if-else conditions for `attach_to` in the `register_named_middleware` function are not mutually exclusive, meaning that both conditions can be true at the same time. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `if` and `if-else` conditions do not account for the possibility of both `attach_to` values being true at the same time. This results in the middleware being added to both `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` simultaneously, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the `if-else` conditions to `if-elif-else` so that only one block of code executes based on the value of `attach_to`.
2. Use separate `if` conditions for `attach_to == "request"` and `attach_to == "response"` to ensure that each block of code is mutually exclusive.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        elif attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
