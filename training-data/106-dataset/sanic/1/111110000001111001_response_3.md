The potential error in the provided function is that the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries are not being initialized before they are being accessed. This will result in a `KeyError` when trying to access the dictionary keys for the first time.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize the `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` dictionaries at the beginning of the `register_named_middleware` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            if not hasattr(self, 'named_request_middleware'):
                self.named_request_middleware = {}
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            if not hasattr(self, 'named_response_middleware'):
                self.named_response_middleware = {}
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
