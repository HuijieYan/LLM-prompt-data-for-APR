The bug is occurring in the `register_named_middleware` function within the `Sanic` class. When registering a "response" middleware, the middleware is being added using `append()` instead of `appendleft()`. This means that the order of execution for the middleware is incorrect, resulting in the second snippet printing "1 2 3 4 5 6" instead of "1 2 3 6 5 4".

To fix the bug, we need to replace `append()` with `appendleft()` when attaching to "response" in the `register_named_middleware` function.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Changed from append to appendleft
```
