The error occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function in the `app.py` file. When registering a "response" middleware, the code adds the middleware to the right using `append()` instead of adding it to the left in reverse using `appendleft()`.

The `register_named_middleware` function should be updated to use `appendleft()` when attaching middleware to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft()` instead of `append()` when attaching the middleware to the response, the named response middleware will be executed in the correct order, resolving the bug.
