The bug in the provided code is that the function `register_named_middleware` should be adding middleware to the request or response middleware lists, but it only does so for the first middleware provided. For any subsequent middleware, it doesn't get added.

To fix this, we can create a separate function to handle the addition of middleware to the named request or response middleware lists. This function should be called whenever a middleware needs to be added.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    # Function to handle the addition of middleware
    def add_middleware(route_names_key, middleware_key, attach_to_key):
        if attach_to_key == "request":
            if route_names_key not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[route_names_key] = deque()
            if middleware_key not in self.named_request_middleware[route_names_key]:
                self.named_request_middleware[route_names_key].append(middleware_key)
        if attach_to_key == "response":
            if route_names_key not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[route_names_key] = deque()
            if middleware_key not in self.named_response_middleware[route_names_key]:
                self.named_response_middleware[route_names_key].append(middleware_key)

    for rn in route_names:
        add_middleware(rn, middleware, attach_to)
```

In this corrected code, we have extracted the addition logic into a separate function `add_middleware` and then called it for each item in the `route_names` list. This ensures that all middlewares are added properly.
