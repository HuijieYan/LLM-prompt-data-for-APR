The test case `test_bp_middleware_order` is trying to test the order of execution of middleware functions in a Sanic blueprint. The expected order is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but the actual order is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]. This indicates that there's an issue with the execution order of the named response middleware.

The potential error location is within the `register_named_middleware` method of the `Sanic` class. Specifically, the issue lies in the conditional checks and the append logic for response middleware. This is causing them to be added in the incorrect order.

The bug occurs because when attaching middleware to responses, the `register_named_middleware` method is using `append` instead of `appendleft` for the named response middleware. This leads to the middleware being added in the wrong order.

To fix this bug, the `append` method should be replaced with `appendleft` when attaching middleware to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` method:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)  # Use appendleft instead of append
```

With this correction, the named response middleware will be added in the correct order when attaching them to the response, and the test case should pass as expected.
