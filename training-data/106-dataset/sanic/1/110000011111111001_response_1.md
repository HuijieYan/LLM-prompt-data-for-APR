The bug is likely in the `register_named_middleware` function where middleware is being added to the `named_response_middleware` regardless of whether the `attach_to` parameter is "response" or "request".

The error message from the test function indicates that the middleware execution order is incorrect. This indicates that the issue is likely with how the middleware is being registered and executed.

The potential error location is in the conditional statements related to 'attach_to' within the `register_named_middleware` function.

The bug occurs because the middleware is being added to both `named_request_middleware` and `named_response_middleware` regardless of whether the 'attach_to' parameter is "request" or "response".

To fix the bug, the conditional statements related to 'attach_to' should be separated so that middleware is added to the appropriate middleware dictionary based on the 'attach_to' parameter.

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```

With this change, the middleware will only be added to the appropriate middleware dictionary based on the value of the 'attach_to' parameter.
