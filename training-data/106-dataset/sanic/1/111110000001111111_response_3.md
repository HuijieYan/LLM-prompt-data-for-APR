The bug occurs in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the `if attach_to == "response"` block. The bug is caused by using `append` instead of `appendleft`, which results in the middleware being added in the wrong order for `response` middleware.

To fix this bug, the `append` function should be replaced with `appendleft` within the `if attach_to == "response"` block.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

With this correction, the `register_named_middleware` function will correctly add the `response` middleware in reverse order using `appendleft`. This should resolve the issue with named response middleware being executed in the wrong order.
