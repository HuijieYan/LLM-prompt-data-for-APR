The bug is related to the `register_named_middleware` function in the `Sanic` class. The bug causes the named response middleware to be executed in the wrong order when added to `self.named_response_middleware[_rn]`. The issue is that the `append()` method is used instead of `appendleft()` for adding middleware to the deque.

The reason behind the bug is that the `append()` method adds the middleware to the right of the deque, causing the middleware to be executed in the opposite order of what is expected. This results in the incorrect execution order of named response middleware.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `appendleft()` method instead of `append()` when adding named response middleware to the deque.

Here's the corrected code for the `register_named_middleware` function:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    if attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By using `appendleft()` for adding named response middleware, the bug causing the middleware to be executed in the wrong order is fixed. This updated code ensures that the named response middleware is added to the left of the deque, maintaining the correct execution order.
