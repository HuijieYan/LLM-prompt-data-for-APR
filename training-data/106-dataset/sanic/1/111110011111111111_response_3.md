The bug appears to be located in the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where middleware is added to the `self.named_response_middleware` dictionary. When `attach_to` is "response", the new middleware should be added to the left in reverse order, using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`. This is causing the middleware to be executed in the wrong order, as seen in the test failure.

The bug occurs because the `register_named_middleware` function is not correctly handling the case when `attach_to` is "response". As a result, the named response middleware is being added in the wrong order, resulting in incorrect execution order.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `register_named_middleware` function to use `appendleft()` instead of `append()` when `attach_to` is "response". This will ensure that the named response middleware is added to the left in reverse order, as expected.

The corrected `register_named_middleware` function is as follows:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
    self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
):
    if attach_to == "request":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
    elif attach_to == "response":
        for _rn in route_names:
            if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
            if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```

By making this change, the named response middleware will be added in the correct order and the test case should pass without errors.
