This buggy function is intended to register middleware based on the `attach_to` parameter. When `attach_to` is "request", the middleware should be added to the `named_request_middleware` dictionary, and when it is "response", the middleware should be added to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary.

The bug occurs because the incorrect dictionary is being updated for the given `attach_to` value. In the original code, both `if` conditions are independent of each other, so the response middleware will be updated even when `attach_to` is "request".

To fix this, we can use an `if-else` condition so that only one dictionary gets updated based on the value of `attach_to`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        else:  # Use else instead of another if condition
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
```
