The error message indicates that the order in which the response middleware functions are executed is incorrect. This suggests that the issue lies within the `register_named_middleware` function, specifically in the section where response middleware is added to the `named_response_middleware` dictionary.

The bug occurs because when middleware is attached to the response, it should be added to the left of the deque using `appendleft()` instead of `append()`.

To fix the bug, the `register_named_middleware` function needs to be updated to use `appendleft()` when attaching middleware to the response.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def middleware(self, middleware_or_request):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the fixed function
    def register_named_middleware(
        self, middleware, route_names, attach_to="request"
    ):
        if attach_to == "request":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_request_middleware:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_request_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_request_middleware[_rn].append(middleware)
        if attach_to == "response":
            for _rn in route_names:
                if _rn not in self.named_response_middleware:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn] = deque()
                if middleware not in self.named_response_middleware[_rn]:
                    self.named_response_middleware[_rn].appendleft(middleware)
```
This correction ensures that response middlewares are added to the left of the deque, preserving the correct execution order.
