The bug occurs because the `_recache` method sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the value of the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the method `is_filled` to return `True` when it should not.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should be hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the `is_filled` method will return the correct value.

This should resolve the issue and the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass without any assertion errors.
