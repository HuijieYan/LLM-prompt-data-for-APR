The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not properly working due to issues within the `_recache` method. As a result, the `is_filled` method is returning an incorrect value, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` method properly updates the `filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class. This attribute is used by the `is_filled` method to determine if the marker is filled or not.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set default filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the default filled attribute to `False` in the `_recache` method, we ensure that it gets correctly updated when the `_marker_function` is called, which will fix the bug.
