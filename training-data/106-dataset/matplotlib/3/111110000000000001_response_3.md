Potential error location: The function is not properly handling the case when `_marker_function` is None.

Reasons behind the bug: The function attempts to call `_marker_function` without checking if it is None, which can result in a AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
