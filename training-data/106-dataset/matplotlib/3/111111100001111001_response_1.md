The bug appears to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set to the correct value within the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class.

The `_recache` function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, including `_filled`, which determines whether the marker is filled. However, the function currently always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the input parameter `_fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the value of `_fillstyle`. If `_fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the value of `_fillstyle`, as intended.
