The bug in the provided function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the input value for `self._fillstyle`. This means that the function doesn't take into account the `self._fillstyle` attribute and always sets `_filled` to True.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to consider the value of `self._fillstyle` before setting `self._filled`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle != 'none':  # Consider self._fillstyle value
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional statement to set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is not equal to 'none', then `self._filled` is set to True, otherwise it is set to False. This change will ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.
