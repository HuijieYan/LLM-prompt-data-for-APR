The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' when the `MarkerStyle` is called with `ax.scatter()`. This is leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # set fillstyle to 'none' to create hollow markers
        self._filled = False
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```
