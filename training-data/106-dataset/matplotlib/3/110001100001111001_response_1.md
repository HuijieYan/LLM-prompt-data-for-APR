Potential error location: 
The function is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally. This may not be the intended behavior and is likely causing the bug.

Reason for the bug:
The bug likely occurs because the `_filled` attribute is being unconditionally set to `True`, regardless of its initial value or any other conditions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the initial value of `self._filled` and only change it if necessary.
2. Introduce a condition to check whether `_filled` should be changed and only proceed if the condition is met.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled is None:  # Check if _filled is None and set it to False
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
