Potential error location: The function is trying to access a property `_marker_function` without first checking if it exists, which may result in an AttributeError if the property does not exist.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not check if the `_marker_function` property exists before attempting to call it. This can lead to an AttributeError if the property is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if the `_marker_function` property is not None before calling it.
2. Handle the case where `_marker_function` is not defined to avoid the AttributeError.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None: # Check if _marker_function is not None before calling
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
