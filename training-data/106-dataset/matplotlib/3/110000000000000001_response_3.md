Potential error location:
The error could occur if the `_marker_function` is not defined or if it is not a callable function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function does not check whether the `_marker_function` is defined or callable before calling it. This can lead to an AttributeError or TypeError if `_marker_function` is not properly defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before calling it.
2. Check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it.

Corrected code:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. This will prevent any AttributeError or TypeError that may occur if `_marker_function` is not properly defined.
