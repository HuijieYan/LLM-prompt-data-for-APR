The error message from the test function indicates that the `is_filled` method is not behaving as expected. The issue is likely related to the `_recache` method, which is called when setting `fillstyle` to 'none'. The `_recache` method then calls the `_marker_function`, which may not be setting the fillstyle correctly.

The `is_filled` method should return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but it is currently returning `True`.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. The `MarkerStyle` should be aware of its fillstyle and return the correct value when `is_filled` is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and initialize the `filled` attribute based on the fillstyle.

We should also ensure that the `filled` attribute is correctly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class to return the correct value when `is_filled` is called.
