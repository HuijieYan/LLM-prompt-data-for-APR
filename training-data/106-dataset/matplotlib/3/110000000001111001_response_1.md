The bug in the _recache function is that the _filled attribute is being set to True unconditionally, regardless of its previous value. This is causing the incorrect behavior in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to set the _filled attribute based on the value of the input parameter self._fillstyle.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the _filled attribute will be set based on the value of self._fillstyle, as expected.
