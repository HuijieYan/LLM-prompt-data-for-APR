The error message from the test function indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, but it should be returning `False` based on the test case. The problem seems to be in the buggy function `_recache`.

Upon analyzing the `_recache` function, it seems that the issue is with the `self._filled` assignment. It's always set to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This doesn't seem to be correct since the expected behavior from the test function is that the marker should not be filled when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`; otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_recache` function will correctly update the value of `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, and the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass without errors.
