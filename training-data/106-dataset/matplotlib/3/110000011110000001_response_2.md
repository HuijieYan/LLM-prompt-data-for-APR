The test_marker_fillstyle function is testing the behavior of a marker style object. It creates a MarkerStyle object with marker='o' and fillstyle='none', and then asserts that get_fillstyle() returns 'none' and is_filled() returns False. The error occurs in the assertion for is_filled(), where it finds that the method always returns True.

The potential error location within the _recache function is the variable self._filled being set to True. This could cause the is_filled() method to always return True, regardless of the fillstyle specified.

The bug occurs because the _recache function sets self._filled to True unconditionally, meaning that the is_filled() method will always return True, regardless of the fillstyle specified. This contradicts the expected behavior where fillstyle='none' should result in is_filled() returning False.

To fix this bug, the _filled attribute should be set based on the specified fillstyle. If the fillstyle is 'none', then _filled should be set to False. Otherwise, it should be set to True.

Here's the corrected _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
