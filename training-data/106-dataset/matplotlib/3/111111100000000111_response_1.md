Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_marker_function` is called without being defined or assigned in the class, which is causing the problem.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `_marker_function` is not defined within the class, so calling it results in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `_marker_function` needs to be defined or assigned within the class before it can be called in the `_recache` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_3/lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        # assuming _marker_function is defined elsewhere and should be called here
        self._marker_function()

```
