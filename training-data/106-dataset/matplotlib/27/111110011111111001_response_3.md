The error occurs when assigning None to the label of the colorbar, as it is not being handled properly in the code. 
The bug is in the `set_label` method of the ColorbarBase class. When the label is set to None, it is not handled correctly resulting in a label with the value 'None' instead of an empty string.

To fix this bug, the None value should be handled explicitly, and if the label is None it should be set to an empty string.

Here is the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
With this correction, when setting the label to None, it will be correctly handled as an empty string, and the assertion error in the test function should be resolved.
