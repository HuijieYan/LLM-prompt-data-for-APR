The bug in the `set_label` function is that when `label` is passed as `None`, the assertion `cbar.ax.get_ylabel() == ''` fails because the `get_ylabel()` method returns the string 'None' instead of an empty string.

The reason for this bug is that when `label` is set to `None`, it is not handled properly in the `set_label` function, and as a result, the `_label` attribute is set to the string representation of `None`, which is 'None'.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `label` is `None` in the `set_label` function and set the `_label` attribute to an empty string in this case.

Here's the corrected `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By adding the conditional check for `label` being `None` and setting `_label` to an empty string in that case, the bug will be fixed, and the assertion in the test function will pass as expected.
