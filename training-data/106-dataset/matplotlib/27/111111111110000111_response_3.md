The issue is that when the label is set to None, the colorbar still displays the text "None" instead of not displaying any label.

The bug is located in the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. In this method, when the label is set to None, it is not handled properly, resulting in the label being displayed as "None" instead of not displaying any label.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label is None. If the label is None, we should not set the `_label` attribute and should not call the `_set_label` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    if label is not None:
        self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when the label is set to None, the `_label` attribute will not be set, and the `_set_label` method will not be called, resulting in no label being displayed on the colorbar when the label is set to None.
