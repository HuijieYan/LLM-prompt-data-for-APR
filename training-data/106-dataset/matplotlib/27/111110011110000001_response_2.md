The error message is asserting that the label is not being set to an empty string when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called. This suggests that the `set_label` function is not properly handling the case when `label` is set to `None`.

The potential error location is within the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class.

The bug is likely occurring because the `set_label()` function does not handle the case when the `label` parameter is set to `None`. It only sets the label when a non-None value is passed, and doesn't clear the label when `None` is passed. 

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a check in the `set_label()` function to handle the case when the `label` parameter is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label()` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, the `_label` attribute is set to `None` when the `label` parameter is `None`, effectively clearing the label in such cases.
