The potential error location is within the `set_label` function in the `ColorbarBase` class. 

The bug occurs because when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, it sets the label to a string "None" instead of clearing the label completely.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label is set to `None`, and clear the label in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:  # Check if label is not None
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''  # Set the label to an empty string
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this corrected `set_label` method, the label will be set to an empty string when the `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, and the assertion in the test function should pass.
