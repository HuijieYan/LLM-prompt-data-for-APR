The potential error location within the problematic function is the set_label method, where cbar.ax.get_ylabel() is not returning the expected value after calling cbar.set_label(None).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the set_label method is not updating the label of the color bar properly, causing the assert statement in the test function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the set_label method to properly update the label of the color bar.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_27/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _set_label(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected set_label method
def set_label(self, label):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = label
    self._set_label()
```

With this corrected method, the label of the color bar will be properly updated when calling set_label.
