The test function `test_colorbar_label` is checking the label of the color bar and asserting its value. The error message indicates that the assertion failed as it expected an empty string but received the value 'None' instead.

The potential error location is the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class, which sets the label of the color bar. In the test case, `cbar.set_label(None)` is expected to remove the label, but it is not working as intended.

The bug occurs because the `set_label` method sets the label to `'None'` when the value passed is `None`, instead of removing the label. This behavior is not intended and causes the incorrect display of the label.

To fix this bug, the `set_label` method should conditionally handle the case when the label value is `None` and ensure that it removes the label instead of setting it to the string `'None'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label) if label is not None else None
    self._labelkw = kw
    if self._label is not None:
        self._set_label()
    else:
        self.ax.set_xlabel('') if self.orientation == 'horizontal' else self.ax.set_ylabel('')
```

With this modification, the `set_label` method now properly handles the case when the label is `None` and ensures that the label is removed in that scenario. This should resolve the bug where the label was being displayed as "None" instead of being removed when `label=None`.
