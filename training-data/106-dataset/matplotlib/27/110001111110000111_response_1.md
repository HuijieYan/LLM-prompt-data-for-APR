The issue seems to be occurring in the `set_label` method of the colorbar class. The error message indicates that when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the label is not being set to an empty string, but instead still showing as "None".

The reason for this bug is that the `set_label` method is not correctly handling the case when the label argument is set to None. Instead of setting the label to an empty string, it is converting None to a string and setting it as the label.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label argument is None and set the label to an empty string in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
``` 

With this modification, when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the label will be set to an empty string, and the assertion in the test function should pass without any errors.
