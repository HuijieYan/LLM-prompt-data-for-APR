The bug is likely occurring within the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. When `label` is set to `None`, the variable `self._label` is assigned the string representation of `None`, which is "None". This is why the label appears as "None" instead of not appearing at all.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `set_label` method to check if the `label` is `None`, and if so, set `self._label` to an empty string instead.

Here's the corrected `set_label` method:
```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, when `label` is set to `None`, the label will not be displayed instead of displaying "None".
