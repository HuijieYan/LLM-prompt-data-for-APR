The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the label is None. When the label is set to None, the function still sets the _label attribute to the string 'None' instead of None itself. This results in the incorrect label being displayed as "None".

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the label is None and set the _label attribute to the None type instead of the string 'None'. This will ensure that the label is not displayed when it is set to None.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this fix, when the label is set to None, the _label attribute will be set to None, and the label will not be displayed.
