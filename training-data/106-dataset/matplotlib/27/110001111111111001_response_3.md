The buggy function is `set_label` and the error seems to be happening when it sets the label to None for the color bar. 

The buggy function is trying to set a label on the color bar, but it fails to remove an existing label. When `set_label` is called with `None`, it fails to remove the label, and hence the assertion fails. 

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the code so that when `None` is passed, it removes any existing label. 

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this fix, when `None` is passed as the label, it will remove any existing label from the color bar, and the error should be resolved.
