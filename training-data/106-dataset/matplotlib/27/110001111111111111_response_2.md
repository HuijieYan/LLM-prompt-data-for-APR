The bug seems to be occurring in the `set_label` method of the `Colorbar` class. When `None` is passed as the label parameter, the label still appears, with the text "None", as if being given `label="None"`.

The potential error location is in the `set_label` method, where it sets `self._label = str(label)`. When `None` is passed as the label, it is being converted to the string "None" and then being set as the label.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the label is None, and if so, set `self._label` to an empty string instead of converting it to a string.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this change, when `None` is passed as the label, the `self._label` will be set to an empty string, and the label will not appear for `None` input.
