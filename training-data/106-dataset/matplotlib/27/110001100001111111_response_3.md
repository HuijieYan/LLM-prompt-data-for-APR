The issue here seems to be with the set_label function in the colorbar.py file. The bug occurs when the label parameter is set to None, resulting in the label appearing as "None" instead of not appearing at all.

To fix this issue, you can modify the set_label function to handle the case where the label is None and avoid setting self._label to the string representation of None.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By adding a conditional check for the label parameter and only setting self._label if label is not None, we can prevent the "None" label from appearing when label is set to None.

This fix addresses the issue where the colorbar label prints "None" when label=None, as reported in the GitHub issue.
