The issue is that when the label argument is set to None in the colorbar function, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of not appearing at all. This is likely due to the _set_label method not handling the None value properly.

To fix this, we can modify the set_label method to check if the label is None, and if so, set the _label attribute to an empty string instead of "None".

Here's the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ""
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
