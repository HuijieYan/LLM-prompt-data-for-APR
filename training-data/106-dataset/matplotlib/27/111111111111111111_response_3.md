The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with the argument `None`. The bug is in the way the `_set_label` method is called within the `set_label` method. When the `label` argument is `None`, it should not call the `_set_label` method and should instead set the `_label` to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to check if the `label` is `None` and handle it appropriately. If the `label` is not `None`, then it should proceed with setting the `_label` and `_labelkw` attributes as before and calling the `_set_label` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
    else:
        self._label = None
        self._labelkw = {}
```

This modification checks if the `label` is not `None` before setting the `_label` and `_labelkw` attributes and calling the `_set_label` method. If the `label` is `None`, then it sets `_label` to `None` and `_labelkw` to an empty dictionary. This will fix the bug and ensure that the label is not displayed as "None" when the `label` is `None`.
