The bug occurs in the set_label method of the ColorbarBase class. The issue is that when the label argument is None, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of being empty.

To fix the bug, we can modify the set_label method to check if the label is None and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, if the label is None, the _label attribute will be set to an empty string, and the text "None" will not appear on the colorbar. This fixes the bug where `label=None` would still display the text "None".
