The error occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when `label` is None. The bug causes the label to display the string "None" instead of displaying no label at all.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when `label` is None. We can do this by checking if the `label` is None, and if so, setting the label to an empty string.

Here's the corrected `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, when the `set_label` method is called with `label=None`, the label will be set to an empty string, and the test case should now pass without any assertion errors.
