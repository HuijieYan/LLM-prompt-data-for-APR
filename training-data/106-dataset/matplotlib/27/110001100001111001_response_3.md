The issue with the provided function is that it is calling another function `_set_label` without the appropriate class qualifier, leading to a NameError. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with handling `kw` as it is not being used.

A possible fix for this function would be to use the appropriate class qualifiers to call `_set_label`, and to incorporate the `kw` dictionary into the label.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()

def _set_label(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```

By using the appropriate class qualifier, the `_set_label` function can now be called without raising a NameError. Additionally, it's important to use the `kw` dictionary to modify the label, if needed.
