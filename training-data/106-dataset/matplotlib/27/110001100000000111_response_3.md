Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be occurring in the set_label method of the colorbar.py file in the matplotlib library.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because when the label argument is set to None, the code still sets self._label to str(label), which results in the string "None" being assigned to self._label.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the label is None and if so, don't assign it to self._label.
2. Modify the code to handle the case when label is None separately.

Corrected Code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
