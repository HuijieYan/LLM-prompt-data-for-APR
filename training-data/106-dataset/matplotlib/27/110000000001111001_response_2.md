The bug in the provided function is that it's trying to update the instance variables `self._label` and `self._labelkw` directly from the `set_label` method without initializing them properly. This can cause inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug:
1. Initialize the instance variables `self._label` and `self._labelkw` in the constructor method of the class.
2. Update the `set_label` method to directly update the initialized instance variables.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self._label = ''
    self._labelkw = {}

def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

In this corrected code, the `__init__` method initializes the instance variables `self._label` and `self._labelkw` to an empty string and an empty dictionary, respectively. Then, the `set_label` method directly updates these initialized instance variables with the provided `label` and `kw` values.
