Potential error location: The buggy code is in the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. The method calls another method `_set_label` which isn't defined in the provided class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_set_label` method is called from the `set_label` method, but it is not defined within the class. This causes an AttributeError, as there is no implementation for this method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `_set_label` method inside the `ColorbarBase` class.
2. Remove the redundant call to `_set_label` and assign the label value directly in the `set_label` method.
3. Ensure that the `label` parameter is correctly assigned to the colorbar's axis label property.

Corrected code for the `ColorbarBase` class:

```python
class ColorbarBase(_ColorbarMappableDummy):
    """
    ...   (existing class documentation)
    """
    
    def set_label(self, label, **kw):
        """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
        self._label = str(label)
        self.ax.set_ylabel(str(label), **kw)
```
