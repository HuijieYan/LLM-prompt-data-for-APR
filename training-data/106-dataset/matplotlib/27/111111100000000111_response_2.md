The bug occurs because the `set_label` method assigns the string "None" to the label attribute if the input label is None. This causes the label to display as "None" instead of being blank.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `set_label` method to check if the input label is None, and if so, set the label attribute to an empty string instead of the string "None".

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = ''
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By making this change, the label attribute will be set to an empty string if the input label is None, resolving the issue where the text "None" is displayed as the label when label=None.
