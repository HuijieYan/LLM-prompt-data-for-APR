Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. When the `cbar.set_label(None)` is called in the test function, it is expected that the `cbar.ax.get_ylabel()` should be an empty string, but it is not.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug seems to be in the `set_label` method where it is not properly handling the case when the label is set to `None`.

Approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when the label is set to `None`. If the label is `None`, the ylabel or xlabel of the axes should be set to an empty string.

```python
class ColorbarBase(_ColorbarMappableDummy):
    # ... other methods ...

    def set_label(self, label, **kw):
        """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
        self._label = str(label) if label is not None else ''  # set label to empty string if label is None
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
```

With this modification, the `set_label` method will handle the case when the label parameter is set to `None` and set the ylabel or xlabel of the axes accordingly.
