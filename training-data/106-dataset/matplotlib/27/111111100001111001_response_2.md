The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._set_label()`.

The bug occurs because the `_set_label` method is not defined within the `ColorbarBase` class, so calling `self._set_label()` will result in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, you can define the `_set_label` method within the `ColorbarBase` class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
```

By removing the call to the undefined `_set_label` method, the function should work correctly without raising an AttributeError.
