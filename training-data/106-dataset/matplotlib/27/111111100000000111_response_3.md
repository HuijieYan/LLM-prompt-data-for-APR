The issue seems to be that when the label argument is set to None in the set_label method, the label still appears with the text "None" instead of not appearing at all.

The potential error location is in the set_label method where the label is set directly to str(label) without checking if the label is None. This causes the string "None" to be assigned to the label.

The bug occurs because the set_label method does not handle the case where the label is set to None.

To fix this bug, the set_label method should be modified to check if the label is None and not assign any value to the label in that case.

Here is the corrected code for the set_label method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

By adding a check for None in the set_label method, the label will only be assigned a value if it is not None. This will prevent the label from appearing as "None" when the label argument is set to None.
