The potential error in the set_label function is related to the call to the _set_label() method within the ColorbarBase class. The _set_label() method is defined as a relative function in the class and should be called using the self keyword.

The bug occurred because the _set_label() method is being called without the self keyword, which is essential to reference the method within the class.

To fix this bug, we need to call the _set_label() method using the self keyword to ensure it is properly referenced within the ColorbarBase class.

Here is the corrected code for the set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
