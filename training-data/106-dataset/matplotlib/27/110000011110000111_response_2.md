Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the set_label function of the colorbar, where the label parameter is not being handled properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: When the label parameter is set to None, it is not being handled correctly and is still being assigned as a string "None" instead of being interpreted as no label.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The set_label function needs to be modified to handle the case when the label parameter is None, and in that case, it should not set any label for the colorbar.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this correction, when the label parameter is set to None, the label for the colorbar will not be set, and the error should be resolved.
