The error occurs because the `set_label` method in the `ColorbarBase` class sets the `self._label` attribute to the exact string value of the `label` argument, even if it is `None`. This results in the literal string "None" being set as the label.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` method to handle the case when `label` is `None` and set `self._label` to `None` in that case. This way, when the label is set to `None`, it will not appear in the colorbar.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is None:
        self._label = None
    else:
        self._label = str(label)
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this change, when the `label` parameter is `None` the `self._label` attribute will also be set to `None`, and the label will not appear on the colorbar.

This fix will address the bug and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report.
