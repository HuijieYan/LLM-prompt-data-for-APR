Potential error location:
The issue might be within the set_label method, specifically in the line "self._label = str(label)" where the label value is converted to a string without checking if it is None.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the set_label method does not check if the label parameter is None before converting it to a string. This results in the _label attribute being set to the string "None" instead of being set to None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the set_label method to check if the label parameter is None before converting it to a string. If the label is not None, then it should be converted to a string and assigned to the _label attribute. If the label is None, then the _label attribute should be set to None directly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
