The error occurs when the `set_label` method is called with `None` as the label argument. The function currently sets `self._label` to the string representation of the label argument, regardless of its value. This results in the string "None" being set as the label when the input is `None`.

To fix the bug, we should check if the label is `None` and handle it appropriately. We can modify the `set_label` method to address this issue.

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when the label is `None`, we set `self._label` to `None` instead of the string representation of `None`.

This change will ensure that when the label is `None`, it will not be displayed as "None" in the colorbar.
