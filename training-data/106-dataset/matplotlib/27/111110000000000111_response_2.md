Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be in the `set_label` function, where the label is not handled correctly when it is given as None.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `set_label` method does not handle the case when the label is given as None. As a result, when the label is set to None, it is converted to a string "None" and displayed as the label.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `set_label` method to explicitly check if the label is None and handle it accordingly.
2. Update the logic in the `set_label` method to not set the label if it is None.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
        self._labelkw = kw
        self._set_label()
    else:
        # Handle case when label is None
        self._label = None
```
