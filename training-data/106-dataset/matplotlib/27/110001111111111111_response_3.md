The bug is occurring in the `set_label` function, where when `label` is set to `None`, the assertion in the test function fails because the `cbar.ax.get_ylabel()` is returning `'None'` instead of an empty string.

The bug occurs because in the `set_label` function, the label is being set to `str(label)`, which includes the conversion of `None` to the string `'None'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `set_label` function to handle the case where `label` is `None` separately to ensure that it does not get converted to the string `'None'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:  # check if label is not None
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when `label` is set to `None`, the `_label` attribute will be set to `None` as well, preventing the conversion of `None` to the string `'None'`.

This change will ensure that the label of the colorbar will be an empty string when `label` is `None`, as expected.
