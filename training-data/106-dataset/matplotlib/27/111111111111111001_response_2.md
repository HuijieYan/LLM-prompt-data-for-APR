The bug occurs in the `set_label` method of the `ColorbarBase` class. The bug is related to how the label is set and updated, as evidenced by the test case failing with the error message AssertionError: assert 'None' == ''. 

The bug occurs because when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, it does not reset the label to an empty string as expected. This indicates that the label is not being properly updated or handled when set to `None`.

To fix the bug, the `set_label` method should be modified to handle the case where the label is set to `None` and correctly update the label displayed on the colorbar. Here's the corrected code for the `set_label` method:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = ''  # Set to empty string if label is None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```

With this modification, when `cbar.set_label(None)` is called, the label will be correctly updated to an empty string, and the test case should pass without errors.
