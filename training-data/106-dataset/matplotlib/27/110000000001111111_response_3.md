The bug occurs because the set_label function does not handle the case when the label is set to None. As a result, when the label is None, the _label attribute is set to the string 'None' instead of being set to None.

To fix this bug, we can modify the set_label function to handle the case when the label is None. We can set the _label attribute to None in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the set_label function:

```python
def set_label(self, label, **kw):
    """Label the long axis of the colorbar."""
    if label is not None:
        self._label = str(label)
    else:
        self._label = None
    self._labelkw = kw
    self._set_label()
```
