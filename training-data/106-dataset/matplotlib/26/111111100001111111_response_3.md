The issue seems to be related to the `getter` and `setter` functions inside the `_make_getset_interval` function. The `getter` function is trying to access attributes using `getattr` but it is encountering an error. The `setter` function also seems to be recursively calling itself in a way that is not intended.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `getter` and `setter` functions are not correctly implemented and are causing errors when trying to access and set attributes.

To fix the bug, the `getter` and `setter` functions need to be re-implemented to correctly access and set the attributes. Additionally, the recursive call in the `setter` function needs to be replaced with a call to the correct function. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
