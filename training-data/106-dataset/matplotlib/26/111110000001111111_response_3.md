Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `setter` function, where `oldmin` and `oldmax` are being assigned the value of `getter(self)`. Subsequently, on the lines following the assignment of `oldmin` and `oldmax`, the `getter` function is being called again recursively. This is likely leading to an infinite loop and causing the function to fail.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `setter` function is calling itself recursively with the `getter` function. This is causing an infinite loop and the function is not able to execute properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of calling the `getter` function again in the `setter` function, we can directly access the `vmin` and `vmax` values from the function arguments.
2. We can create a new function to calculate `oldmin` and `oldmax` values and use that function instead of calling `getter` recursively.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = calculate_old_values(vmin, vmax)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
        
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter

def calculate_old_values(vmin, vmax):
    oldmin, oldmax = vmin, vmax
    if oldmin < oldmax:
        oldmin, oldmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
    else:
        oldmin, oldmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
    
    return oldmin, oldmax
```
