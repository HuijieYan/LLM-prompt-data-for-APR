The issue appears to be related to the `_make_getset_interval` function, which is used to generate `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations. The issue seems to be with the `setter` function, where it is trying to recursively call itself instead of the outer `setter` function.

The potential error location is within the `setter` function, where it recursively calls itself instead of calling the parent `setter` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `setter` function is calling itself recursively instead of calling the outer `setter` function, which leads to unexpected behavior and likely causes the heatmaps to be truncated.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should be modified to call the outer `setter` function instead of calling itself recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
