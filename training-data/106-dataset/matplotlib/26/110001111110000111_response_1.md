The bug is likely located in the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the setter method. The issue seems to be with the logic for handling the ignore parameter and updating the vmin and vmax values.

The bug occurs because the `min` and `max` functions are incorrectly used in the setter method. It should check if vmin is less than vmax, and update the values accordingly. Additionally, the use of recursion with the `setter` method may create an infinite loop and should be avoided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the setter method to correctly update the vmin and vmax values based on the ignore parameter. We should remove the recursion and instead directly set the vmin and vmax values to the respective attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)
            setter_name = f"set_{method_name}_interval"
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these corrections, the issue with the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` test case should be resolved. Additionally, the bug related to the truncated heatmaps in the GitHub issue should also be addressed.
