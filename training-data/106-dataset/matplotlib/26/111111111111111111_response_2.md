The test function `test_set_ticks_inverted` creates a plot and inverts the x-axis then sets the x-ticks to 0.3 and 0.7. The following assertion checks that the x-axis limits are correctly inverted and is expected to pass. However, due to a bug in the `_make_getset_interval` function, the assertion fails, and the x-axis limits are not correctly inverted.

The bug occurs in the `_make_getset_interval` function where the `getter` and `setter` functions are defined. The problem is with the recursive calls to `setter` within itself, causing an infinite loop and incorrect computations.

To fix the bug, the recursive calls to `setter` should be replaced by calls to `getattr` and `setattr` functions to properly set the interval values. Additionally, the conditional check `if oldmin < oldmax` within the `setter` method needs to be changed to ensure the correct order of the min and max values.

Here is the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
