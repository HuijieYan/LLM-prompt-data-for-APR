The issue seems to be related to the `getter` and `setter` functions in the `_make_getset_interval` method. The `setter` function is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect behavior when setting the ticks for the x-axis.

The bug occurs because the `setter` function does not handle the input values correctly and fails to set the limits for the x-axis accordingly. This results in the assertion error when checking the x-axis limits.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should be modified to correctly handle the input values and set the x-axis limits accordingly. This can be accomplished by adjusting the logic for setting the minimum and maximum values for the x-axis limits.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` method:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the x-axis limits are properly set when using the `setter` function.
