Potential Error Location:
The potential error location lies in the setter function. The recursive calls to the setter function are causing an infinite loop, which is likely the reason for the bug.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the infinite recursion in the setter function. When the condition `if oldmin < oldmax` is met, the recursive calls to `setter` function are made without making any progress, leading to an infinite loop.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. We can update the logic to avoid the infinite recursion in the setter function by using a while loop instead of recursive calls.
2. We can also add a base case to the recursive calls to exit the recursion when certain conditions are met.
3. Another approach is to reevaluate the logic in the setter function to avoid the need for recursion altogether.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                vmin = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                vmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
