The error message from the test function `test_set_ticks_inverted` indicates that the `ax.get_xlim()` is returning an inverted result compared to the expected value. This suggests that the issue may be within the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the logic for setting the limits based on `ignore` flag.

The bug is occurring because the logic for setting the limits in the `setter` function is incorrect. When `ignore` is False, the logic to update the limits is also flawed, resulting in the inverted values and causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the limits in the `setter` function needs to be corrected. Instead of recursively calling the `setter` function, the logic should directly update the limits based on the conditions specified.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            new_min = min(vmin, vmax) if vmin < vmax else max(vmin, vmax)
            new_max = max(vmin, vmax) if vmin < vmax else min(vmin, vmax)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this correction, the bug related to inverted limits should be resolved, and the test case should pass successfully.
