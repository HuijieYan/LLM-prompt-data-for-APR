The error occurs when the `assert` statement is comparing the result of `ax.get_xlim()` with the expected value `(1, 0)`. The error message indicates that the result is `(0.7, 0.3)` instead of the expected `(1, 0)`. This suggests that there is a problem with the `get_xlim` method.

Upon reviewing the provided function `_make_getset_interval`, it appears that there are recursive calls to the `getter` and `setter` functions inside the `setter` function. This is causing an infinite recursion and incorrect results, leading to the failure of the `assert` statement in the test case.

To fix this issue, the recursive calls to `getter` and `setter` within the `setter` function should be replaced with direct calls to `getattr` and `setattr` respectively.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_make_getset_interval`:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

By making these changes, the infinite recursion is resolved and the `assert` statement in the test case should now pass as expected. This should also fix the issue of truncated heatmaps when using seaborn, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description.
