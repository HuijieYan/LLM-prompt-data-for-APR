The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` creates a new plot and inverts the x-axis. Then, it sets the x-ticks to be at 0.3 and 0.7, and finally checks if the x-axis limits are correctly set. However, the assertion fails, stating that `(0.7, 0.3) == (1, 0)`, meaning that the x-axis limits are not as expected.

The bug is likely located in the `setter` part of the `_make_getset_interval` function, where it attempts to set the new limits. The issue likely arises from the process used to determine the new limits, which is causing the inversion and incorrect setting of the limits.

The buggy code is trying to update the limits but in a confusing and incorrect way. It incorrectly swaps the `vmin` and `vmax` values based on a condition which is leading to the inversion of the axis limits.

To fix this bug, a simpler and more straightforward approach should be used to set the axis limits without inverting them or swapping values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessarily complex logic and unnecessary swapping of vmin and vmax. It simply sets the axis limits based on the provided vmin and vmax without trying to adjust the values based on conditions. This should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
