The error is occurring in the `setter` function of the `_make_getset_interval` method. The issue seems to be with comparing `oldmin` and `oldmax` values before performing the inversion operations.

The `setter` function is trying to handle the case where `oldmin` and `oldmax` might not be in ascending order. However, the implementation is incorrect and is causing the wrong results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `setter` function to directly handle the inversion of the values without comparing and swapping them.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected `setter` function, we directly set the attribute with the min and max values of `vmin` and `vmax`. This approach simplifies the inversion handling and ensures that the correct intervals are set.
