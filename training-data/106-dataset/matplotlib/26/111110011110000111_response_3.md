The error message indicates that the `ax.get_xlim()` is returning `(0.7, 0.3)` instead of `(1, 0)`, which is causing the test case to fail. This suggests that there is a problem with the implementation of the `get_{method_name}_interval` and `set_{method_name}_interval` functions.

Upon reviewing the provided function `_make_getset_interval`, it seems that the issue lies in the `setter` function. The recursive calls to `setter` within the `if` and `else` blocks are incorrect, which leads to an infinite loop and incorrect results.

The issue occurs because of incorrect logic when handling the old minimum and maximum values and the new values for vmin and vmax. The incorrect recursive calls cause the values to be swapped, leading to incorrect results.

The bug can be fixed by removing the recursive calls and instead directly setting the attributes using `getattr` and `setattr`. Additionally, the logic for comparing oldmin and oldmax needs to be corrected to ensure the correct assignment of vmin and vmax.

Here is the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            new_vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            new_vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmin, new_vmax))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

The corrected `setter` function now correctly handles the old minimum and maximum values and sets the new vmin and vmax directly without the need for recursive calls. This should resolve the issue with the test case failing and the heatmaps being truncated.
