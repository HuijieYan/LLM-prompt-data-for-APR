The error occurs when the test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` tries to assert that `ax.get_xlim()` returns (1, 0), but it actually returns (0.7, 0.3). This indicates that there is a bug in the `getter` and `setter` functions that are generated by the `_make_getset_interval` function.

The potential error location within the `_make_getset_interval` function is the setter function. It seems that the `setter` function is calling itself recursively, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the recursive call to the `setter` function is incorrect and may lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results due to the mismatch in the call arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the recursive call from the `setter` function and replace it with a call to the `getter` function to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """
    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
``` 

With this change, the `setter` function no longer calls itself recursively. Instead, it calls the `getter` function to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values, then sets the attribute based on those values. This should resolve the bug and correct the behavior of the `getter` and `setter` functions.
