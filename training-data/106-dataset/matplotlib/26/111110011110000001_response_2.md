The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` is trying to verify that when the x-axis is inverted and ticks are set at 0.3 and 0.7, the resulting xlim should be (1, 0). However, the test is failing with an assertion error because the actual xlim is (0.7, 0.3) instead of (1, 0).

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `setter` method. It appears that there is an issue with the logic for handling the inverted axis.

The bug occurs because the code is treating the inverted axis in a way that is not consistent with how it should be handled. When the axis is inverted, the minimum and maximum values are flipped, so the logic for handling the bounds needs to take this inversion into account.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the `setter` method to correctly handle the inverted axes by swapping the values of vmin and vmax when the axes are inverted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if self.axes.get_xscale() == 'linear' or self.axes.get_yscale() == 'linear':
            if ignore:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            else:
                oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
                if oldmin < oldmax:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
                else:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True
        else:  # For inverted axis
            if ignore:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
            else:
                oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
                if oldmin < oldmax:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmax, vmin, oldmin), min(vmax, vmin, oldmax)))
                else:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmax, vmin, oldmax), max(vmax, vmin, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the inverted axis is explicitly added within the `setter` method. Depending on whether the axis is linear or inverted, the correct logic for handling vmin and vmax is applied.
