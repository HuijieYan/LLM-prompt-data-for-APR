The potential error in the function `_make_getset_interval` is that it is defining the `getter` and `setter` functions inside the helper function, but it is not returning them as a tuple. This means that when the function is called, it is not returning the `getter` and `setter` functions as expected.

The reason for this bug is that the `getter` and `setter` functions are defined inside the helper function, but they need to be returned as a tuple in order to be used as a getter and setter pair.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_make_getset_interval` function to return the `getter` and `setter` functions as a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                       ignore=True)
            else:
                setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                       ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This corrected code will return the `getter` and `setter` functions as a tuple, allowing them to be used as intended.
