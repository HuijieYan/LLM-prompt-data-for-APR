The issue seems to be related to the generation of getter and setter functions for data intervals in Matplotlib. The bug is likely causing the heatmaps to be truncated.

The issue is occurring in the `setter` function. The function is calling itself recursively, but it is never exiting the recursion because there is no base case to stop the recursion. This results in a stack overflow error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `setter` function to include a base case and remove the recursion. We can achieve this by directly setting the values for the data intervals in the `setter` function without calling itself recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected code, the recursion issue in the `setter` function has been addressed, and the stack overflow error should no longer occur. This should prevent the heatmaps from being truncated as well.
