The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` sets ticks on the x-axis and then inverts the x-axis. It then checks if the x-axis limits are correctly updated with respect to the inverted axis. However, as per the error message, the assertion fails because the limits returned are not as expected after inverting the x-axis and setting the ticks.

The issue lies in the `_make_getset_interval` function which is used to generate `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations. When the x-axis is inverted, the old limit values are not correctly handled, resulting in the incorrect values being returned by `get_xlim`.

The bug occurs because when oldmin is greater than oldmax (due to inverting), the logic for updating the limits is incorrect in the setter function.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the correct logic is used to handle the cases where oldmin is greater than oldmax.
2. Use the correct comparison and assignment operations when updating the limits.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
