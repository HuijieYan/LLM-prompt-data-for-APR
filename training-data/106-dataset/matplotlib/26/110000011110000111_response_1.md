The error is occurring in the `setter` function of the `_make_getset_interval` method. The logic inside the `setter` function seems to be incorrect, and it leads to the incorrect behavior when setting the x-axis ticks in the test case.

The reason for the bug is that the `setter` function does not handle the inversion of x-axis properly, resulting in the incorrect assignment of the x-axis limits. This leads to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function needs to be modified to properly handle the inversion of the x-axis. Also, the way the `getter` and `setter` functions work together needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these corrections, the bug causing the assertion error in the test case should be resolved.
