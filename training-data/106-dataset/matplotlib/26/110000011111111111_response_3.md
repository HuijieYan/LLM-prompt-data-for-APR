The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `setter` function within the `_make_getset_interval` method. The error message from the test function suggests that the `get_xlim` method is returning the incorrect value.

The reason behind this bug is that the `setter` function is not correctly handling the inversion of the axes. It should be considering the inverted state of the axis when setting the limits.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should first check if the axis is inverted, and if so, handle the minimum and maximum values accordingly. Also, the recursive calls to the `setter` function should be replaced by direct assignments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            ax = self.axes
            inverted = ax.xaxis_inverted() if 'x' in lim_name else ax.yaxis_inverted()
            if inverted:
                vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            setattr(getattr(ax, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this change, the `setter` function now correctly handles the inversion of the axes and sets the limits accordingly. This should resolve the issue with the heatmap being truncated.
