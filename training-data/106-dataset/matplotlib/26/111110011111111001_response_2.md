The error message from the test function indicates that the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` is failing and returning `(0.7, 0.3)` instead of the expected `(1, 0)`. This suggests that there is a problem with setting the limits using the `set_xticks` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` function where the limits are being set.

The bug occurs because in the `setter` function, when there is no `ignore`, the `oldmin` and `oldmax` are retrieved using the `getter` function, but it is attempting to call the `setter` function inside itself recursively, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the recursive calls to `setter` inside the `setter` function should be replaced by calls to `getter` and `setter` methods.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In this corrected code, the recursive calls to `setter` have been replaced with correct assignments to `new_min` and `new_max`, followed by setting the updated limits using `setattr`. This should resolve the issue with the buggy function.
