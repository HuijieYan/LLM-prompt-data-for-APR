Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `setter` function. It seems to be recursively calling the `setter` function without proper termination condition, leading to a potential infinite loop.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `setter` function is not properly terminating when it recursively calls itself. This can lead to an infinite loop and potentially cause the heatmap truncation issue reported in the GitHub issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the recursive call in the `setter` function needs to be replaced with a loop or a different implementation that does not lead to potential infinite recursion. Additionally, proper termination conditions should be added to prevent the function from entering an infinite loop.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                vmin = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                vmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
