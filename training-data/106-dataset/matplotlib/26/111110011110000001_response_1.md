The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` is checking if the x-axis limits are correct after inverting the x-axis and setting specific x-ticks. The error message indicates that the `get_xlim` method is returning values (0.7, 0.3) instead of the expected (1, 0).

The potential error in the `_make_getset_interval` function lies in the `setter` method. The method is trying to compare the oldmin and oldmax values to determine the new limits, but it uses recursive calls to the `setter` method instead of using the `getter` method to retrieve the old limits.

The bug occurs because the recursive calls to `setter` are not updating the `vmin` and `vmax` values as intended. Additionally, the comparison logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect limits being set.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `setter` method to correctly use the `getter` method to retrieve the old limits and then compare them to calculate the new limits.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            if oldmin >= oldmax:
                vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `setter` method properly uses the `getter` method to retrieve the old limits and then compares them to calculate and set the new limits based on the conditions.
