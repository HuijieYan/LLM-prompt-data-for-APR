The potential error location within the problematic function is in the setter method. The current implementation of the setter method has a recursive function call `setter(self, ...)` which ends up causing an infinite loop, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially causing the heatmaps to be truncated.

The reason behind the bug is that the recursive call to `setter(self, ...)` should be calling the `setter` function that is returned by the `_make_getset_interval` function, rather than recursively calling itself.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to `setter(self, ...)` should be replaced with a call to the actual `setter` function returned by `_make_getset_interval`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                # Use the actual setter function returned by _make_getset_interval
                _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name)[1](self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), ignore=True)
            else:
                # Use the actual setter function returned by _make_getset_interval
                _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name)[1](self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this correction, the recursive function call in the setter method has been replaced with a call to the actual setter function returned by `_make_getset_interval`, which should resolve the issue of heatmaps being truncated.
