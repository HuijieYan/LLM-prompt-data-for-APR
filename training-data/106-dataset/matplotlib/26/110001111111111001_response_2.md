The error message from the test function suggests that there is an issue with the `get_xlim()` method in the `axes` class. The values returned by this method are not as expected after calling `ax.invert_xaxis()` and `ax.set_xticks([.3, .7])`.

The potential error location is within the `_make_getset_interval` function where the `setter` is not updating the limits correctly when the data is inverted (e.g., with `ax.invert_xaxis()`).

The bug occurs because when the data is inverted, the minimum and maximum values are reversed, leading to incorrect representation of the limits. The current logic in the `setter` function does not account for this inversion, leading to the wrong limits being set.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `setter` function to correctly handle the inverted data by swapping the `vmin` and `vmax` values if the data is inverted. Additionally, we should update the logic to handle the `ignore` parameter properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                if self.axes.get_xscale() == 'linear':
                    setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), ignore=True)
                else:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
            else:
                if self.axes.get_xscale() == 'linear':
                    setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), ignore=True)
                else:
                    setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected implementation, we've added logic to check the x-axis scale and appropriately handle the inversion of data. This should address the issue with the incorrect limits being set, and the test case should pass without errors.
