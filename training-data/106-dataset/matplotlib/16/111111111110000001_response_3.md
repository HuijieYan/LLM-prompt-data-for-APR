The error indicates that there is an "overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "overflow encountered in scalar absolute" within the `nonsingular` function. This suggests that the subtraction and absolute value operations are resulting in values that are outside the valid range, leading to overflow.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue` using the `max` and `abs` functions. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the calculation of `maxabsvalue` is resulting in values that exceed the valid range, leading to overflow warnings.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the potential overflow scenarios where the absolute value and the calculated maximum absolute value could exceed the valid range.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = np.maximum(np.abs(vmin), np.abs(vmax))
    if not np.isfinite(maxabsvalue) or maxabsvalue > 1e-6:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we use `np.maximum` instead of the built-in `max` function to avoid overflow. We also added a check for the validity of `maxabsvalue`. Finally, we use `np.abs` for absolute value calculation to handle any potential overflow issues.
