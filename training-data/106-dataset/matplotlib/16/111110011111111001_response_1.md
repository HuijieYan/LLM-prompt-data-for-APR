The error message indicates that an overflow error was encountered in the function `nonsingular` when the parameters `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0` were passed. This overflow error occurs when calculating the absolute value of these parameters, as seen in the error message.

The error occurs due to the extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` causing the calculation of `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)` to overflow.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function `nonsingular` to handle extreme values and prevent overflow errors from occurring. One approach is to check for these extreme values and handle them separately to avoid arithmetic overflow. Additionally, we can ensure that the data types of the variables are appropriate to handle such large values without causing overflow errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ...  (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    ...  (same as before)
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue == np.inf:  # check for extreme values
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * np.abs(vmin)  # use numpy's abs to handle extreme values
            vmax += expander * np.abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```

With this modification, we explicitly check for extreme values and handle them separately to avoid arithmetic overflow. Additionally, using `np.abs` from the numpy library helps handle extreme values more effectively.
