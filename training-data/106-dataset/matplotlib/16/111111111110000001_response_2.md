The error message indicates that an overflow error is encountered, specifically in the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax`, resulting in a RuntimeWarning.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the calculation of the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` when determining `maxabsvalue`. This calculation could lead to an overflow error, especially when dealing with large numbers.

The overflow error occurs because the code attempts to calculate the absolute value of very large numbers, which exceeds the range that the data type can represent.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use a different method to calculate the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` that avoids potential overflow errors. This can be achieved by directly comparing the values to 0 and taking the absolute value only if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    elif not increasing and vmax > vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Calculate the range of the values
    range = vmax - vmin

    if range < max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        # Range is too small, expand vmin and vmax
        if vmin == vmax:
            vmin = vmin - expander
            vmax = vmax + expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

With this corrected code, it should prevent the overflow error encountered in the original implementation.
