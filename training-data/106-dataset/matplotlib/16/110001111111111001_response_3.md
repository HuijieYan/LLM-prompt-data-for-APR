The error occurs in the `nonsingular` function, specifically in the line `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` where a RuntimeWarning about overflow is raised.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to calculate the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` using the `max` function, which can lead to overflow if the values are very large, as encountered in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we can use a conditional check to handle the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` when they are very large.

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np  # Make sure to import numpy at the beginning of the file

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    
    if abs_vmin < tiny and abs_vmax < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)
        if maxabsvalue > tiny:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax
        else:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    
    return vmin, vmax
```
In this corrected function, we explicitly calculate the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` and use conditional checks to handle cases where these absolute values are very large. This should prevent the overflow error encountered in the test cases.
