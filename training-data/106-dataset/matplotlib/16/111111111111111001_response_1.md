The error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute". These warnings suggest that the subtraction and absolute value operations are resulting in overflow due to the large integer values being used as input parameters (`vmin`, `vmax`).

The `nonsingular` function is encountering overflow issues when handling large integer values as inputs. This is because the function is intended for handling floating point numbers, but it is being provided with integers instead.

To fix this issue, the `nonsingular` function should handle situations where large integer values are passed as input parameters. This can be achieved by casting the input parameters to float before performing any calculations. 

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np  # Import the numpy module

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    # Cast input parameters to float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    
    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly casting `vmin` and `vmax` to float at the beginning of the function, the overflow issues caused by handling large integer values are mitigated. The adjusted function can now handle both integer and floating point inputs appropriately.
