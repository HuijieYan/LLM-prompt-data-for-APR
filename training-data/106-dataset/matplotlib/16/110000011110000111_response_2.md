## The issue

The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered when taking the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` within the `nonsingular` function. This implies that the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are larger than what can be represented by the data type being used, which is `int16` in this case. It also suggests that the function `nonsingular` may not be handling edge cases properly when dealing with very large or very small input values.

## Potential bug location

The potential bug may be located in the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. Since the error message specifically mentions an overflow encountered in scalar absolute, this line might be the cause of the problem.

## Reason behind the bug

The `nonsingular` function is intended to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities, but it assumes that the input values are within a certain range. When dealing with very large or very small input values, the function might not handle them properly and result in overflow errors.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug

1. **Cast vmin and vmax to floats**: Before performing any calculations or comparisons on `vmin` and `vmax`, it might be helpful to cast them to float to ensure that the calculations are not limited by the data type (int16 in this case) being used.

2. **Handle edge cases**: Specifically check for edge cases where the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are very large or very small. These cases should be handled with care to avoid overflow errors.

3. **Adjust the calculation**: If the calculation of `maxabsvalue` is causing overflow errors, consider alternative ways of calculating it to avoid overflow.

## Corrected code

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ...  # (same as original)

    Returns
    -------
    ...  # (same as original)
    """

    # Cast vmin and vmax to floats
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, `vmin` and `vmax` are cast to float early on to ensure that they are not limited by the data type being used. This should help prevent overflow errors when dealing with large or small input values.
