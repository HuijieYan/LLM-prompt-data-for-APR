The potential error location within the problematic function is where it checks if the magnitude of the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than `maxabsvalue * tiny` and then adjusts `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `vmax` and `vmin` are very small or close to zero, and the check for `vmax == 0 and vmin == 0` alone is not sufficient to cover all edge cases.

To fix this bug, we can add an additional check to ensure that the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than a certain threshold rather than only checking the difference against `maxabsvalue * tiny`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
  
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= tiny:  # Additional check for the absolute difference
        if abs(vmax) < tiny and abs(vmin) < tiny:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we added an additional check for the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`, and adjusted the condition inside the `elif` block to cover all edge cases where `vmax` and `vmin` are very small or close to zero.
