Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the error is occurring in the `nonsingular` method within the `matplotlib.transforms` module. The error is likely due to an overflow encountered in scalar subtraction or scalar absolute operation.

The reason for the overflow error could be that the given input values are out of the acceptable range, causing the overflow when performing arithmetic operations.

To fix this, one approach could be to ensure that the input values are within an acceptable range before performing any operations that might result in an overflow. This can be done by validating the input values and potentially scaling them to an appropriate range if necessary.

The corrected code for the `nonsingular` method would be as follows:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    # Check if the values exceed the acceptable range
    if maxabsvalue > 1e6:
        scale_factor = 1e-6 / maxabsvalue
        vmin *= scale_factor
        vmax *= scale_factor
        expander *= scale_factor

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the input values are checked to determine if they exceed the acceptable range, and if so, they are scaled down to ensure that the subsequent arithmetic operations do not result in an overflow.
