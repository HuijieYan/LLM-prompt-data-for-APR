The error message indicates that an overflow error was encountered when taking the absolute value of a variable. This is likely due to the variable being of type int16 and reaching its maximum value, causing an overflow when taking its absolute value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all calculations are done using floating-point arithmetic rather than integer arithmetic. This can be achieved by casting the input values to floating-point numbers early in the function before performing any calculations.

In the original function, the following line should be added at the beginning of the `nonsingular` function to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are properly converted to floats:

```python
vmin = float(vmin)
vmax = float(vmax)
```

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
