The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect use of the `np.finfo(float).tiny` value, which is being used to check if an interval is smaller than a certain threshold.

The bug occurs because the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is ineffective. The intention of this comparison is to check if the interval is smaller than a certain threshold, but due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, it might fail to give the correct result.

To fix this bug, we can change the comparison criterion to use a relative comparison with a small value rather than directly comparing the difference of `vmax` and `vmin` with the product of `maxabsvalue` and `tiny`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif (vmax - vmin) / maxabsvalue <= tiny:  # Use a relative comparison
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if (vmax < vmin) and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
