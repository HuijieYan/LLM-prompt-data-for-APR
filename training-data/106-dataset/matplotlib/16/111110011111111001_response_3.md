The error is occurring in the `nonsingular` function, specifically in the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line. The error message indicates that an overflow is encountered in the scalar absolute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that for large integer values, the absolute function is generating overflow errors when converting from int16 to float64.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input is converted to an appropriate type before performing the absolute operation. This can be achieved by explicitly casting the input to float before taking the absolute value.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    # Explicitly cast to float before taking absolute value
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By explicitly casting the input to float before performing the absolute operation, we ensure that there are no overflow errors when dealing with large integer values.
