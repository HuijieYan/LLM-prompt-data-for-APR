The error in the given code is occurring due to a potential division by zero error because the value of `tiny` is set to 1e-15, which can lead to numerical instability. This is causing the RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract or RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

To fix this issue, the value of `tiny` should be set to a larger value, such as 1e-10, to avoid numerical instability and potential division by zero error. Additionally, the `increasing` parameter is not being used in the function and should be removed to avoid confusion.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-10):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-10
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
