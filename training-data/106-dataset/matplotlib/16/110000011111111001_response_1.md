The error message indicates that an overflow occurred when taking the absolute value of a large number in the `nonsingular` function. This suggests that the bug is related to handling very large integer values, likely due to the explicit use of integer types that are susceptible to overflow.

The `nonsingular` function is using `np.int16` to map the input values which are later processed within the function. However, numpy int16 datatype has the range between -32768 to 32767. This is causing an overflow in the function when calculating the absolute value for values outside this range.

To fix this issue, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Use explicit type casting to convert the input variables to float before processing them in the `nonsingular` function to avoid overflow issues.
2. Instead of using the `np.int16` type, use a more suitable type or generic representation that can accommodate a wider range of value without overflowing.
3. Modify the function to handle integer values within a safe range without causing overflow.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function taking into account the above approach:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

    # Convert input to float
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
