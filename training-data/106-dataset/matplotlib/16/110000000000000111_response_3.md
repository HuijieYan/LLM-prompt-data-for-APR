Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the calculation of the expanded vmin and vmax due to the use of non-float values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the function is not explicitly casting the endpoints `vmin` and `vmax` to float values before performing calculations on them.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Cast `vmin` and `vmax` to `float` at the beginning of the function to ensure consistent data types are used throughout the calculations.
2. Check for any division operations and ensure that the numerator and denominator are both explicitly cast to `float` if necessary.
3. Handle cases where the input `vmin` or `vmax` are not numeric (e.g., if they are None) to prevent errors during the casting process.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    ... (rest of docstring remains the same) ...

    """

    # Cast vmin and vmax to float
    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
