The error messages indicate that there are overflow warnings encountered due to scalar subtraction and absolute operations when processing the values using the `nonsingular` function. This is likely caused by incorrect handling of extreme values such as -20000, 20000, -32768, and 0.

The issue occurs when the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` becomes too large, causing overflow warnings. This can be observed from the part of the code where `maxabsvalue` is calculated using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. When the input values are extreme, such as when dealing with int16 range (-32768, 32767) or (-32768, 0), the absolute value calculations may result in overflow warnings.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle extreme values differently. We can modify the function to bypass the absolute value calculation for certain input ranges and directly handle the required manipulations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    # Ensure vmin is not greater than vmax if increasing is True
    if increasing and vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    # Handle special cases
    if vmax == vmin == 0 or (vmax - vmin) < tiny:
        return -expander, expander
    if vmax == vmin:
        return vmin - expander, vmax + expander

    # Process other cases
    diff = vmax - vmin
    if diff > 0:
        expander = max(expander, diff * tiny)  # Set expander value based on the difference
    else:
        expander = -expander  # Adjust expander for negative difference

    return vmin - expander, vmax + expander
```
