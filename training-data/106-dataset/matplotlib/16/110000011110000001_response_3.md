The error occurs when the function `nonsingular` is called to process values for the color bar. The error message indicates that there is an overflow encountered in scalar absolute, which is likely due to large values being processed.

The issue within the `nonsingular` function is that it does not handle large input values properly, leading to overflow and runtime warnings.

The excessive use of float type checks needs to be avoided. Also, `tiny` should be frequently used in the condition checks, and it should be replaced with the interval size.

To fix the bug in the `nonsingular` function, the following parts need to be updated:
1. Remove the use of np.isfinite check because it can lead to an excessive number of float type checks.
2. Modify the condition checks to use the interval size instead of `tiny`.
3. Verify the behavior of the input values when they are large, and handle them appropriately to avoid overflow errors.

Here's the corrected `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.isinf(vmin) or np.isinf(vmax) or np.isclose(vmin, 0) and np.isclose(vmax, 0):
        return -expander, expander

    interval_size = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval_size <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)
    else:
        max_thresh = (1e6 / interval_size) * np.finfo(float).tiny
        if maxabsvalue < max_thresh:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
