The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract," and an "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" within the `nonsingular` function. This means that there is an overflow issue during the calculation.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is the area where arithmetic operations are performed, specifically when checking the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin`.

The overflow problem occurs because the function does not handle extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` properly.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax` gracefully. One approach to address this issue is to use the `np.nextafter` function to find the next representable value in the floating-point number line. This will ensure that any arithmetic operations involving extremely large or small values will not cause an overflow.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin = np.nextafter(vmin, vmax)
            vmax = np.nextafter(vmax, vmin)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = (vmax, vmin) if vmax < vmin else (vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function addresses the overflow issue by using `np.nextafter` to find the next representable value in the floating-point number line when handling extreme values of `vmin` and `vmax`.
