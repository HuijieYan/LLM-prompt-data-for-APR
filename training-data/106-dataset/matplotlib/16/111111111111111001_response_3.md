The error message in the test function indicates that an overflow was encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute operations. This suggests that the problematic function `nonsingular` has some arithmetic operations that are causing overflow errors.

The potential error location is identified in the following lines of the `nonsingular` function:
```python
elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
    if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    else:
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the arithmetic operations in the `nonsingular` function are not handling very large or very small values properly, leading to overflow errors.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check for potential overflow before performing arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by using conditional statements to handle extreme value cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            if abs(vmin) < abs(vmax) and abs(vmax) + expander > 0:
                vmin = vmin - expander * abs(vmin)
                vmax = vmax + expander * abs(vmax)
            else:
                vmin = vmin * (1 - expander)
                vmax = vmax * (1 + expander)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```
