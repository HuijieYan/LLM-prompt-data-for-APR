Potential Error Location: The potential error lies in the if condition `if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` and the subsequent elif condition `elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`. These conditions seem to be incorrectly checking for the size of the interval and expanding it if it is too small.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the conditions for checking if the interval is too small and needs to be expanded are not correctly implemented. The logic for expanding the interval is not appropriate.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The conditions to check if the interval is too small need to be revised. The logic for expanding the interval should be updated to correctly handle different scenarios of input values.

```python
# Corrected function
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    if np.isclose(vmin, vmax, atol=tiny):
        if abs(vmin) < tiny and abs(vmax) < tiny:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```
The corrected function includes changes to appropriately handle the interval expansion and swapping logic, as well as utilize np.isclose for better comparison of floating point numbers.
