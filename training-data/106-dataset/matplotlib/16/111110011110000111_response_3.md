Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and absolute calculation. This indicates that the values for `vmin` and `vmax` are reaching the limit of their data type, which is likely because the values are not casted to floats early enough.

The potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is when it calculates the `maxabsvalue` using `max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. If `vmin` and `vmax` are of a data type with a small range, such as int16, then the absolute function and the max function may lead to overflow issues.

To fix this bug, the values for `vmin` and `vmax` should be casted to floats early in the `nonsingular` function. This will ensure that the subsequent calculations involving these values are performed using floating-point arithmetic, avoiding overflow issues with small data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, optional, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, optional, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, optional, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
