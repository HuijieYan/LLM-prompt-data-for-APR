This issue arises when attempting to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges in the hist function of matplotlib. While using date objects directly as bins (e.g., plt.hist(dates, bins=date_edges)) should ideally work, it results in a TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The root cause of this issue is the type promotion error when operating between datetime objects and floats. It occurs because the code does not handle datetime objects correctly when used as bin edges.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be updated to handle datetime objects properly as bin edges. This may involve converting datetime objects to a numeric representation before passing them as bins.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
             cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
             orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
             color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    if isinstance(bins, (list, np.ndarray)) and isinstance(bins[0], mdates.DateConverter):
        bins = mdates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bins to numeric representation

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged.

```

In this corrected code, a check is added to identify if the bins passed as input are of type datetime. If so, the datetime bins are converted to a numeric representation using mdates.date2num before being used. This approach ensures that datetime bins can be used without causing a type promotion error.
