This bug appears to be related to the handling of datetime objects as bin edges in the `hist` function of matplotlib. The error is raised due to a type mismatch between float and datetime objects, specifically when attempting to pass a list of datetime objects as `bins` to the `hist` function.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where bins are being processed for the `hist` function. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of datetime objects, resulting in a type promotion error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the bins are correctly processed and converted to a format that is compatible with the input data. This could involve explicitly converting the datetime bin edges to a numerical format to avoid type mismatches, and handling datetime objects appropriately to ensure seamless compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `hist` in the Axes class of matplotlib:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if bins is None:
        bins = len(x)  # Determine the default number of bins

    if isinstance(bins, list) and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # Convert datetime bins to numerical format

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ... omitted code ...

    return tops, bins, cbook.silent_list('Lists of Patches', patches)
```

This corrected code checks if the provided `bins` are a list of datetime objects, and if so, converts them to a numeric format using `mpl.dates.date2num` before proceeding with the histogram computation. This approach addresses the type promotion error associated with datetime bins in the `hist` function.
