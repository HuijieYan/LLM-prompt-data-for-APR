The test case provided calls the `hist` function of the `ax` object, with `bins` parameter being preprocessed before being passed to the `hist` function. The preprocessing functions used are `mpl.dates.date2num`, a lambda function that returns the input as is, and a lambda function that converts the input to a `datetime64` array.

The error occurs within the `hist` function while calling `np.histogram()`. The error message indicates that the comparison operator `<` is not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The issue arises because the `np.histogram()` function internally calls `_search_sorted_inclusive()` method, which tries to compare the input array with the preprocessed `bin_edges`. Since the preprocessing of `bin_edges` has not been handled consistently, it leads to the comparison mismatch between the array and the preprocessed `bin_edges`.

To fix the issue, the preprocessing of `bin_edges` should be handled consistently across all cases in the `hist` function. Specifically, if the `bins` parameter is preprocessed before passing it to the `np.histogram()` function, it should be done consistently for all inputs.

The `hist` function should be modified to preprocess the `bin_edges` consistently before calling `np.histogram()` to avoid the type mismatch.

Below is the corrected code for the `hist` function:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):

    # Preprocess the bins if required
    if bins is not None and callable(bins):
        bins = bins(range)  # Assuming `range` is passed as an argument to the bins preprocess function

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

By handling the preprocessing of `bin_edges` consistently within the `hist` function, it would resolve the type mismatch issue and prevent the error from occurring.
