The error occurs when attempting to use a list of datetimes as bin edges in the `hist` method of the `Axes` class. The error message indicates that there is a type promotion issue, specifically mentioning a comparison between a float and a datetime object.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of bins and weights in the `hist` method, specifically in the line:
```python
m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, weights=w[i], **hist_kwargs)
```
This line involves the calculation of the histogram using `np.histogram`, which appears to lead to the type promotion error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `hist` method does not handle datetime bin edges correctly, leading to type mismatch issues during the histogram calculation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle datetime bin edges properly in the `hist` method. This might involve converting datetime bin edges to a format compatible with the histogram calculation.

Here's the corrected `hist` method:

```python
# other imports and code here

def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    if bins is not None and isinstance(bins, list) and isinstance(bins[0], datetime):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)  # convert datetime bins to a format compatible with histogram

    # ... existing code ...

    m, bins = np.histogram(x[i], bins, weights=w[i], **hist_kwargs)

    # ... existing code ...
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if `bins` is a list of datetime objects and then convert it to a format compatible with the histogram calculation using `mpl.dates.date2num` before calling `np.histogram`. This approach ensures that the bin edges are handled correctly and the type promotion issue is resolved, allowing the `hist` method to work with datetime bin edges.
