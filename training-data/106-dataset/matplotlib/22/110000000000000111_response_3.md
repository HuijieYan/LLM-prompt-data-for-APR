The error occurs when using a list of date or datetime objects as bin edges in the `plt.hist()` function. The error message indicates a TypeError related to not being able to compare instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'. This suggests that there is an issue with the type conversion or comparison within the function, leading to the error.

The potential error location within the function is where the bin edges (`bins`) are being processed and used, specifically in the handling of datetime objects and their conversion to float values for comparison and computation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling datetime bin edges correctly, leading to type promotion errors when trying to compare datetime objects with float values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Ensuring that datetime bin edges are handled consistently and converted to float values where necessary for comparisons.
- Checking for the type of bin edges and handling datetime objects appropriately to avoid type promotion errors.
- Implementing stricter type checking and conversion for datetime bin edges to ensure compatibility with the histogram computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, addressing the issue with datetime bin edges:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import itertools
from numbers import Number

# this is the corrected function
def hist(self, x, bins='auto', range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(bins, (list, np.ndarray)) and all(isinstance(b, (datetime, np.datetime64)) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # ... (remaining code for the function)
```
In the corrected code, the function now checks if the `bins` are a list or numpy array of datetime objects and converts them to float values using `mpl.dates.date2num` if necessary. This ensures that datetime bin edges are handled correctly and should resolve the type promotion error encountered in the issue description.
