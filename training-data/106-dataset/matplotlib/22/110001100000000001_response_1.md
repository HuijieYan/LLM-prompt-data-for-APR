The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for processing the input data for creating histograms.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect data processing or handling within the function, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to review how the input data is being processed, perform proper validation, and ensure that the logic for creating histograms is implemented correctly.

```python
# Corrected function with fixes
def hist(self, x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None,
         cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid',
         orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False,
         color=None, label=None, stacked=False, **kwargs):
    if np.isscalar(x):
        x = [x]
    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function
    # ...
```
