The error is triggered when trying to use a list of datetime objects as bin edges in the `plt.hist` function, resulting in a TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'datetime.datetime'.

The potential error location is in the `hist` method of the Axes class, specifically when it calls `_search_sorted_inclusive` to calculate the histogram of the datetime data with the given bins.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function doesn't handle the comparison between datetime objects and floats correctly, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_search_sorted_inclusive` function to ensure it handles datetime objects and floats correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `hist` method:

```python
def hist(self, x, bins=None, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if bins is not None and all(isinstance(b, datetime) for b in bins):
        bins = mpl.dates.date2num(bins)

    # Calculate the histogram
    m, bins = np.histogram(x, bins, **kwargs)

    return m, bins
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the bins are a list of datetime objects and convert them to floats using `mpl.dates.date2num` if necessary. Then, we calculate the histogram using the converted bins.

This fix ensures that the `hist` method can handle lists of datetime objects as bin edges without triggering a TypeError.
