The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" in the function `nonsingular()` at line 961 in `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`. Similarly, there is another warning "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" at line 2794.

The potential error location is within the section of the code where the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is being calculated. The warning message indicates that there might be an overflow during this calculation.

The reason behind this bug is that the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is leading to an overflow when it exceeds the capacity of the data type being used for the calculation. This is a common issue when dealing with very small or very large numbers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to change the way the expansion of the interval is calculated to avoid potential overflows. This can be achieved by using a safer and more robust method for expanding the interval without risking overflow.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular()` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif abs(vmax - vmin) <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking the absolute difference between `vmax` and `vmin` has been modified to prevent the overflow issue. Now, the `abs()` function is used directly when calculating the difference, and this should help avoid the overflow problem.
