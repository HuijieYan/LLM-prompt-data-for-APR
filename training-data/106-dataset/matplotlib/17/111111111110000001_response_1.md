The error messages indicate that there are potential overflow issues in the `nonsingular` function. This is likely due to the way the function expands the range of values by a small amount, which may lead to numerical overflow for certain input values. Additionally, the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` and `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute` indicate that the overflow occurs during arithmetic operations.

To fix the potential overflow issues in the `nonsingular` function, it is important to consider the specific cases where overflow might occur and handle them appropriately. One possible approach is to check for potential overflow before performing arithmetic operations and adjust the calculations accordingly. It may also be necessary to consider using numerical data types with larger ranges to avoid overflow.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if maxabsvalue * (1 + tiny) > maxabsvalue:
        # Avoid potential overflow by adjusting expander according to the range of input values
        expander = max(expander, (maxabsvalue * tiny) / (1 + tiny))
        vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander*abs(vmax)
    else:
        # If the range is too large, simply return the inputs
        return vmin, vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code includes a check to prevent potential overflow in the calculation of the expanded range. By adjusting the expander value based on the range of input values, we can ensure that the calculations do not lead to overflow.
