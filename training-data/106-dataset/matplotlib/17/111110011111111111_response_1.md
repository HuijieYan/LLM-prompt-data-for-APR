The error occurs in the `nonsingular` function, specifically in the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` which may lead to overflow issues.

The bug likely occurs because the calculated maximum absolute value is not handled correctly, leading to improper comparisons and potential overflow.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use conditional statements to handle extreme cases where overflow or other issues may arise. Additionally, error handling for extreme cases and boundary conditions should be implemented.

Here's the corrected function with additional error handling and boundary condition checks:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander
    
    if vmin == 0 and vmax == 0:
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin < 0 and vmax > 0:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    else:
        if abs(vmin) > abs(vmax):
            maxabsvalue = abs(vmin)
        else:
            maxabsvalue = abs(vmax)
    
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected function addresses the potential overflow by handling extreme cases separately and introduces error handling for specific boundary conditions.
