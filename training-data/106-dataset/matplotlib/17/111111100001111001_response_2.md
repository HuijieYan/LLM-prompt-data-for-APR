The buggy function `nonsingular` has several issues:

1. The function is missing the necessary import for `numpy`.
2. In the first condition, if either `vmin` or `vmax` is infinite, the function should return `-expander` and `expander`, but the code currently returns `expander` and `-expander`.
3. The condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` is problematic because it doesn't handle the case where both `vmax` and `vmin` are negative. The formula `vmax - vmin` could be negative in this case, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. The condition to handle cases where both inputs are 0 or very close to zero is incorrect. It should handle the case where both inputs are very close to zero, not just exactly zero.
5. The comparison `(1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` should be `1e6 * np.finfo(float).tiny / tiny` to avoid potential rounding errors.

To fix these issues, the following corrected code can be used for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin > vmax and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    if (vmax - vmin) <= max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)) * tiny:
        if abs(vmax) < 1e-15 and abs(vmin) < 1e-15:
            return -expander, expander
        else:
            return vmin - expander * abs(vmin), vmax + expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code addresses the issues mentioned earlier, including ensuring the correct return values when the conditions are met. It also includes the necessary import for `numpy`.
