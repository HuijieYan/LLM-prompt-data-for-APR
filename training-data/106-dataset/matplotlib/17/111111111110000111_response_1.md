The error message indicates that there is a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" within the `nonsingular` function in the "transforms.py" file.

Upon analyzing the function, the potential error location is the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This calculation might result in an overflow error when the difference between `vmin` and `vmax` is large or when the absolute value of `vmin` or `vmax` is very large.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `maxabsvalue` calculation is not handling the potential overflow or large absolute values properly.

To fix the bug, we can handle the potential overflow and large absolute values by using a try-except block to catch the overflow error and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import math

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    try:
        maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    except OverflowError:
        # Handle potential overflow error
        maxabsvalue = math.inf

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we use a try-except block to catch the potential overflow error when calculating `maxabsvalue`. If an overflow error occurs, we set `maxabsvalue` to `math.inf` to handle the situation. This approach prevents the overflow error and ensures the proper handling of large absolute values.
