The potential error location within the 'apply_aspect' function is in the following line:
```
        if aspect == 'equal':
            aspect = 1
```
Here, the code is trying to compare the aspect to the string 'equal' and assign it the value 1 if it matches, which would cause a comparison error.

The reason behind the bug is that the aspect should be compared to a numerical value, not a string. The code should be checking if the aspect is None or not, and if it's not None, it should proceed with the calculations using the numerical value of aspect.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to check if the aspect is None or not, and then proceed with the required calculations accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code for the 'apply_aspect' function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.

    if position is None:

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect != None:

        fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

        if self._adjustable == 'box':
            if self in self._twinned_axes:
