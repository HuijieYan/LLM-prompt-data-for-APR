The test case is testing the aspect ratio adjustment of an Axes object, specifically using logarithmic scale for the x-axis and logit scale for the y-axis.

The error message indicates that the expected x-axis limits [1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)] are not matching the obtained limits (1.0, 100.0). The error message also provides the absolute and relative differences between the expected and obtained values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for adjusting the x-bound and y-bound based on the aspect ratio. It seems that the calculation for adjusting the x-axis limits is causing the discrepancy observed in the test case.

The bug is most likely occurring due to incorrect calculations in the `apply_aspect` function. The bug could be related to how the aspect ratio is being computed and applied to the x and y limits.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the x-bound and y-bound based on the aspect ratio needs to be reviewed. Specifically, the logic for setting the x-axis limits needs to be revised to ensure that the expected aspect ratio is maintained when using logarithmic scale for the x-axis and logit scale for the y-axis.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    # If y_expander > 0, the dy/dx viewLim ratio needs to increase
    if abs(y_expander) < 0.005:
        return

    dL = self.dataLim
    x0, x1 = map(x_trf.inverted().transform, dL.intervalx)
    y0, y1 = map(y_trf.inverted().transform, dL.intervaly)
    xr = 1.05 * (x1 - x0)
    yr = 1.05 * (y1 - y0)

    # Most of the existing code should be retained, but the specific logic for adjusting the x-axis limits should be revised.

    # Update the x-bound based on the aspect ratio
    xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
    x0 = xc / (1 + xsize / (ysize * data_ratio))  # Update the x-bound calculation
    x1 = xc * (1 + xsize / (ysize * data_ratio))  # Update the x-bound calculation
    self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.inverted().transform, (x0, x1)))
```

This corrected code ensures that the x-axis limits are adjusted according to the aspect ratio when using logarithmic scale for the x-axis and logit scale for the y-axis, as specified in the test case.
