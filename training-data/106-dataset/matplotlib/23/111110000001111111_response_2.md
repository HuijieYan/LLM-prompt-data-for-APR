The bug is caused by the incorrect transformation of x and y limits when the aspect is set and adjustable='datalim'. The code uses x_trf.inverted().transform instead of x_trf.transform, which causes the failure in the test case. 

To fix the bug, the correct transformation method (x_trf.transform) should be used to transform the x and y limits. Additionally, the code for choosing to always expand one of the axes when aspect is set and adjustable='datalim' needs to be simplified, as the old complex conditions were causing unexpected behavior. 

Here's the corrected code for the apply_aspect function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    # Correct transformation of x and y limits
    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

By making these corrections, the apply_aspect function should now correctly handle the aspect and adjustable='datalim' cases and pass the test case.
