The error in the test case is due to the incorrect handling of the aspect ratio for the datalim-adjustable axes. When applying the aspect to the axes, the x-axis limits and y-axis limits are not being adjusted properly, leading to the failed assertion in the test case.

The potential error location within the function is identified as the section where the x and y limits are determined and adjusted based on the aspect ratio. The incorrect handling of the transform operations and the logic for adjusting the limits seems to be the cause of the bug.

The bug occurred because the code did not properly handle the aspect ratio adjustment for datalim-adjustable axes. When determining the x and y limits, the transform operations were not applied correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments of the limits.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the transform operations are applied properly to the x and y limits to account for the aspect ratio. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the limits based on the aspect ratio needs to be revised to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xlim())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ylim())

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

    if data_ratio > 1:
        ysize = xmax - xmin
        xsize = ysize * data_ratio
    else:
        xsize = ymax - ymin
        ysize = xsize / data_ratio

    xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
    yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)

    x0 = xc - 0.5 * xsize
    x1 = xc + 0.5 * xsize
    y0 = yc - 0.5 * ysize
    y1 = yc + 0.5 * ysize

    self.set_xlim(x0, x1)
    self.set_ylim(y0, y1)
```

This corrected code ensures that the aspect ratio is properly handled for datalim-adjustable axes, adjusting the x and y limits based on the calculated aspect ratio.
