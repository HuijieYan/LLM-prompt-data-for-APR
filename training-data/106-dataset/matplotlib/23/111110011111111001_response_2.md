The error originates from the 'apply_aspect' function in the '_AxesBase' class. It seems that the aspect ratio adjustment logic inside the 'apply_aspect' function does not produce the expected results. The error is likely to be with the aspect ratio calculation and the adjustability in this function.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the aspect handling logic within the 'apply_aspect' function. The aspect handling logic tries to adjust the aspect ratio of the Axes in a non-linear adjustable scenario but appears to produce inaccurate aspect ratio calculations. Additionally, the adjustability parameter may not be functioning as expected, leading to wrong aspect ratio adjustments.

To fix the bug, the 'apply_aspect' function's aspect ratio calculation and adjustability logic should be reviewed. Ensure that the expected aspect ratio adjustments are made correctly based on the given parameters such as 'aspect', 'adjustable', and 'position'. Additionally, the condition checks and switch between datalim and other adjustable cases should be carefully reviewed and rectified if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the 'apply_aspect' function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'datalim':
        x0, x1 = map(self.xaxis.get_transform().inverted().transform, self.dataLim.intervalx)
        y0, y1 = map(self.yaxis.get_transform().inverted().transform, self.dataLim.intervaly)

        xc = 0.5 * (x0 + x1)
        yc = 0.5 * (y0 + y1)

        xsize = max(abs(x1 - x0), 1e-30)
        ysize = max(abs(y1 - y0), 1e-30)

        box_aspect = fig_aspect * (ysize / xsize)
        data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect

        Ysize = data_ratio * xsize
        Xsize = ysize / data_ratio

        xm = 0
        ym = 0

        adjy = Ysize > ysize
        if (adjy and Ysize > ysize + ym) or (Xsize > xsize + xm):
            if adjy:
                y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
                y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
                self.set_ybound(*map(self.yaxis.get_transform().transform, (y0, y1)))
            else:
                x0 = xc - Xsize / 2.0
                x1 = xc + Xsize / 2.0
                self.set_xbound(*map(self.xaxis.get_transform().transform, (x0, x1)))
    else:
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
```

In the corrected function, a more appropriate aspect ratio calculation and adjustability logic is implemented based on the input parameters and scenarios.
