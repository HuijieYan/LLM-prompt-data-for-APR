Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the axis limits when the aspect ratio is set and adjustable="datalim". The original code uses complex conditions to determine whether to expand or shrink the x or y limits, and this has resulted in unexpected behavior and caused failures in test cases.

Error Location:
The potential error location is within the apply_aspect() function, specifically in the section where the code determines which axis (x or y) to adjust based on the aspect ratio.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the original code uses complex conditions to determine how to adjust the axis limits based on the aspect ratio, leading to unexpected behavior and test failures.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Simplify the logic for determining which axis to adjust based on the aspect ratio.
2. Choose a consistent approach for adjusting the axis limits when the aspect ratio is set and adjustable="datalim".

Corrected Code:
```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())
    xsize = max(abs(xmax - xmin), 1e-30)
    ysize = max(abs(ymax - ymin), 1e-30)

    l, b, w, h = position.bounds
    box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
    data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect
    
    # Choose to always expand one of the axises to avoid sending artists out-of-bounds
    adjust_y = data_ratio > 1
    if adjust_y:
        yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
        y0 = yc - ysize / 2.0
        y1 = yc + ysize / 2.0
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
    else:
        xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
        x0 = xc - xsize / 2.0
        x1 = xc + xsize / 2.0
        self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.inverted().transform, (x0, x1)))
