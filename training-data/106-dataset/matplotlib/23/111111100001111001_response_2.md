The `RuntimeError` is being raised due to the value of `adjust_y` being `False` when it is expected to be `True` in the buggy function.

The bug is occurring because the conditions for setting `adjust_y` to `False` are not appropriate. This is leading to the incorrect setting of `adjust_y` as `False`.

To fix the bug, the conditions for setting the value of `adjust_y` need to be corrected. Based on the expected behavior, `adjust_y` should be set to `True` when the conditions indicate it, and the same should be reflected in the `expected` values.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
    
    if shared_y:
        adjust_y = True
    else:
        if xmarg > xm and ymarg > ym:
            adjy = ((Ymarg > 0 and y_expander < 0) or
                    (Xmarg < 0 and y_expander > 0))
        else:
            adjy = y_expander > 0
    
        adjust_y = shared_x or adjy
    
    # ... (remaining code is unchanged) ...
```
