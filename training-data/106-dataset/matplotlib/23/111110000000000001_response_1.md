The potential error location in the problematic function is in the line `pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)` where `shrunk_to_aspect` method is not a valid method for the variable `pb`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `shrunk_to_aspect` method is not a valid method for the variable `pb`. It seems like the intention is to calculate a new position based on the aspect ratio and the original position, but the method being used is incorrect.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use valid methods to calculate the new position based on the aspect ratio and the original position. This may involve using calculations to adjust the position based on the aspect ratio, rather than relying on a method that does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
