The bug is caused by a logic error in the `apply_aspect` function. Specifically, the calculation for adjusting the y-axis limits when the aspect ratio is set and `adjustable="datalim"` is causing unexpected behavior and failing the test.

The reason for the bug is that the code is using complex conditions to determine whether to expand or shrink the x or y limits to achieve the correct aspect ratio. This complexity is causing unexpected behavior and failing the test.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for adjusting the limits based on the aspect ratio. Instead of using complex conditions to determine whether to expand or shrink the x or y limits, we can simply choose to always expand one of the axes to avoid sending artists out-of-bounds.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
