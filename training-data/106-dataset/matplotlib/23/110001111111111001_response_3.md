The `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test case sets an aspect for the `Axes` and then applies the aspect using the `apply_aspect` method. The test expects certain `xlim` and `ylim` values after applying the aspect.

Based on the error message, the test fails when comparing the actual `ax.get_xlim()` value to the expected value. The issue seems to be related to how the aspect is being applied, specifically the calculation of the `xlim` and `ylim` values.

The potential error in the `apply_aspect` function might be related to the `adjust_y` and `yc` calculations.

The bug occurs because the `apply_aspect` method fails to properly adjust the ylim values when the `adjustable` parameter is set to `"datalim"`. This causes the `get_xlim()` and `get_ylim()` assertions in the test case to fail.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to revise the section of the code in the `apply_aspect` function that handles the adjustment of y-values when `adjust_y` is `False`. The code should properly recalculate the y-values based on the aspect ratio.

The corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function is as follows:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    if adjust_y:
        yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
        y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
        y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
    else:
        yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
        y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
        y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
        self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
```

This corrected code should correctly adjust the y-values based on the aspect ratio when `adjust_y` is `False`, ensuring the correct behavior when applying the aspect.
