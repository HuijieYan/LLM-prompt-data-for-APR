The bug in the `apply_aspect` function appears to be related to the transformation of data limits. The code uses `x_trf.inverted().transform` to transform the data limits, but it should use `x_trf.transform` instead. This is likely causing issues with how the axes are being adjusted when the aspect is set and `adjustable="datalim"`.

The reason for the bug is that the code is using the inverted transformation to transform the data limits, which results in incorrect adjustments to the axes when the aspect is set.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to use `x_trf.transform` instead of `x_trf.inverted().transform` to transform the data limits. Additionally, the logic for choosing which axis to expand or shrink should be revisited, as described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
