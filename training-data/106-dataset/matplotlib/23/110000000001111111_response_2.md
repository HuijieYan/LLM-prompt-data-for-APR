The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the x and y limits in the `apply_aspect` function. It is also mentioned that the code for choosing which axis to expand or shrink is complex and difficult to understand. 

The potential error location seems to be in the calculation of the x and y limits using `x_trf.inverted().transform` instead of `x_trf.transform`. This seems to be the reason behind the incorrect aspect and axis selection when zooming datalim-adjustable fixed-aspect axes.

To fix the bug, the code for calculating x0, x1, y0, and y1 should be updated to use `x_trf.transform` instead of `x_trf.inverted().transform`. Additionally, the complex conditions for choosing the axis to expand or shrink can be replaced with a simpler condition to always expand one of the axes.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # Existing code...

    if self._adjustable == 'datalim':
        # Previous calculations...
        
        x0, x1 = map(x_trf.transform, dL.intervalx)
        y0, y1 = map(y_trf.transform, dL.intervaly)
        
        # Other calculations...
        
        # Simplifying the condition for choosing which axis to expand
        adjust_y = True  # Always expand the y-axis
        
        if adjust_y:
            yc = 0.5 * (ymin + ymax)
            y0 = yc - Ysize / 2.0
            y1 = yc + Ysize / 2.0
            self.set_ybound(*map(y_trf.inverted().transform, (y0, y1)))
        else:
            xc = 0.5 * (xmin + xmax)
            x0 = xc - Xsize / 2.0
            x1 = xc + Xsize / 2.0
            self.set_xbound(*map(x_trf.inverted().transform, (x0, x1)))

    # Existing code...
```

This should address the issues mentioned and provide the expected behavior for the `apply_aspect` function.
