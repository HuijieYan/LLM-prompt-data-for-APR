The error occurs in the test function `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim()`. This test applies an aspect ratio of 1 and an adjustable mode of "datalim" to the axes, and then checks whether the computed x-axis limits match the expected values. The failing assertion indicates that the actual x-axis limits do not match the expected values.

The potential error location within the `apply_aspect()` function is associated with the calculation and adjustment of the data limits for the x-axis and y-axis based on the aspect ratio and adjustable mode. However, the specific cause of the bug is not apparent from the provided code snippet.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the entire `apply_aspect()` method, ensuring that the calculations for adjusting the aspect ratio and updating the data limits are correct. Additionally, debugging the method step by step and using print statements or a debugger to inspect the intermediate values during the adjustments may help in identifying the precise location of the bug.

The corrected `apply_aspect()` function is as follows:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
