The error message from the test function suggests that there is a mismatch in the calculated x-axis limits compared to the expected values. This indicates a potential issue in the `apply_aspect` function, especially in the calculation of the x-axis limits.

The bug occurs when trying to calculate the x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and the adjustable parameters. The choice of whether to change the x or y limits to achieve the correct aspect ratio is complex and not fully understood, causing unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for determining which axis to expand (x or y) to achieve the correct aspect ratio. Additionally, the calculation of x-axis limits based on aspect ratio and adjustable parameters needs to be reviewed.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    if aspect != 'auto' and aspect is not None:
        xmin, xmax = self.get_xbound()
        xsize = xmax - xmin
        ysize = xsize / aspect

        if self.get_adjustable() == 'datalim':
            self.set_xbound(xmin, xmax)
            ymin = self.get_ybound()[0]
            self.set_ybound(ymin, ymin+ysize)
```
This corrected code simplifies the logic for adjusting the aspect ratio and fixes the calculation of the x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and the datalim adjustable parameters.
