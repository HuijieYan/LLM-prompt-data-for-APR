The issue seems to be occurring within the `apply_aspect` function, specifically when it checks the shared_x and shared_y axes. The bug seems to be raised because the function incorrectly sets `adjust_y` to `False` when it should be set to `True` based on the input values.

The reason for this issue could be a logical error in the conditions used to determine the value of `adjust_y`.

To fix this issue, the conditions for setting the value of `adjust_y` should be reviewed and adjusted. It seems that the condition `(xmarg > xm and ymarg > ym)` should ensure that `adjust_y` is set to `True`. The existing code sets it to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # existing code ...
    # <...>
    if shared_y:
        adjust_y = True
    else:
        if xmarg > xm and ymarg > ym:
            adjy = ((Ymarg > 0 and y_expander < 0) or
                    (Xmarg < 0 and y_expander > 0))
        else:
            adjy = y_expander > 0
        adjust_y = shared_x or adjy  # (Ymarg > xmarg)
    # <...>
    # existing code ...
```
