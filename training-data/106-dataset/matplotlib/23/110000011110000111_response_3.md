The error is occurring when the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test function is run. The `assert` statement is failing because the obtained values are not approximately equal to the expected values.

The potential error in the function is located in the section where the x and y limits are calculated: 
```python
x0, x1 = map(x_trf.inverted().transform, dL.intervalx)
y0, y1 = map(y_trf.inverted().transform, dL.intervaly)
```
The bug is caused by using `x_trf.inverted().transform` instead of `x_trf.transform` to calculate the x and y limits.

To fix the bug, we should update the above section to use `x_trf.transform` instead of `x_trf.inverted().transform`.

Here's the corrected function incorporating the fix:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # rest of the code

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()

    # Corrected code
    x0, x1 = map(x_trf.transform, dL.intervalx)
    y0, y1 = map(y_trf.transform, dL.intervaly)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making the above change, the bug should be fixed and the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test function should pass without any assertion errors.
