The error in the test case is due to the buggy behavior of the `apply_aspect` function. When the aspect is set and adjustable="datalim", the function should change the x or y limits to get the correct aspect, but the old code used complex conditions to determine whether to expand or shrink one of the axes. This complexity led to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug in the `apply_aspect` function, we need to simplify the logic for choosing which axis to resize to get the correct aspect. Instead of using complex conditions, we can choose to always expand one of the axes to avoid sending artists out-of-bounds, except in the case of shared axes, which should not be modified.

Here's the corrected `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    shared_x = self in self._shared_x_axes
    shared_y = self in self._shared_y_axes

    # Choose which axis to resize to get the correct aspect
    if not (shared_x and shared_y):
        if fig_aspect * (position.height / position.width) < aspect:
            y0, y1 = position.y0, position.y1
            yc = 0.5 * (y0 + y1)
            ysize = (y1 - y0) / fig_height * fig_width
            y0 = yc - ysize / 2
            y1 = yc + ysize / 2
            self.set_ybound(*(self.transData.inverted().transform((0, ysize))))
        else:
            x0, x1 = position.x0, position.x1
            xc = 0.5 * (x0 + x1)
            xsize = (x1 - x0) / fig_width * fig_height
            x0 = xc - xsize / 2
            x1 = xc + xsize / 2
            self.set_xbound(*(self.transData.inverted().transform((0, xsize))))
```

With this corrected code, the `apply_aspect` function should now choose the appropriate axis to resize to get the correct aspect when adjustable="datalim", and the test case `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` should pass successfully.
