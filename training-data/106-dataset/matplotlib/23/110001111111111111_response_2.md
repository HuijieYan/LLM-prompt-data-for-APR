The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where the function is checking whether to expand the x limits or the y limits to get the correct aspect. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected x limits and actual x limits are not matching.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect logic for choosing which axis to resize to get the correct aspect ratio. The old code used complex conditions to either expand or shrink one of the axes based on certain conditions. However, the new approach could be to always choose to expand one of the axes rather than shrink, which may avoid sending artists out of bounds. 

To fix the bug, the logic for choosing which axis to resize should be revisited and simplified as per the new approach mentioned above. Additionally, the appropriate transformation methods should be used to calculate x0, x1, y0, and y1.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
