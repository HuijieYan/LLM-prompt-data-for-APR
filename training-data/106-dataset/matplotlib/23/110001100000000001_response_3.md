Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the portion of code that calculates the new aspect ratio and adjusts the view limits based on the aspect ratio.

Reason for the bug: The bug could be caused by incorrect calculations of the aspect ratio and the subsequent adjustments to the view limits.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the calculations related to the aspect ratio and the adjustments to the view limits to ensure they are accurate.
2. Check the conditional statements and logic for applying the aspect ratio to identify any potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
        if position is None:
            position = self.get_position(original=True)
    
        aspect = self.get_aspect()
    
        if aspect == 'auto':
            self._set_position(position, which='active')
            return
    
        if aspect == 'equal':
            aspect = 1
    
        fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
        fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width
    
        if self._adjustable == 'box':
            if self in self._twinned_axes:
                raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                                   "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
            box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
            pb = position.frozen()
            pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
            self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
            return
    
        # self._adjustable == 'datalim'
    
        self._set_position(position, which='active')

        if self.get_xscale() != 'linear' or self.get_yscale() != 'linear':
            raise RuntimeError("Non-linear axes are not currently supported by apply_aspect.")

        x0, x1 = self.get_xbound()
        y0, y1 = self.get_ybound()
        xsize = max(abs(x1 - x0), 1e-30)
        ysize = max(abs(y1 - y0), 1e-30)
    
        l, b, w, h = position.bounds
        box_aspect = fig_aspect * (h / w)
        data_ratio = box_aspect / aspect
    
        target_aspect = xsize / ysize * data_ratio
    
        if target_aspect > 1:
            self.set_xlim((x0 + x1 - ysize * target_aspect) / 2, (x0 + x1 + ysize * target_aspect) / 2)
        else:
            self.set_ylim((y0 + y1 - xsize / target_aspect) / 2, (y0 + y1 + xsize / target_aspect) / 2)
```
