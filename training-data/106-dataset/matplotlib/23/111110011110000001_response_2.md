The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is failing because the obtained values for the x-limits do not match the expected values specified by `pytest.approx([1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)])`. The obtained values are (1.0, 100.0), which are significantly different from the expected values.

The potential error in the `apply_aspect` function is likely related to the aspect ratio calculation and adjustment of the x-limits and y-limits based on the specified aspect.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect aspect ratio calculations and adjustments, leading to the wrong x-limits and y-limits being set.

To fix the bug, the aspect ratio calculations and adjustment of x-limits and y-limits should be carefully evaluated. The conditional statements involving the aspect ratio, as well as the manipulations of xsize, ysize, l, b, w, h, and other variables, may need to be revised to ensure the correct aspect ratio adjustments are made.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    """
    Adjust the Axes for a specified data aspect ratio.

    Depending on `.get_adjustable` this will modify either the Axes box
    (position) or the view limits. In the former case, `.get_anchor`
    will affect the position.

    Notes
    -----
    This is called automatically when each Axes is drawn.  You may need
    to call it yourself if you need to update the Axes position and/or
    view limits before the Figure is drawn.
