The test case is asserting the x-axis limits of the plot created using the buggy function. The error message indicates that the obtained x-axis limits are not equal to the expected x-axis limits.

The potential error location lies in the `apply_aspect` function within the `matplotlib.axes.Axes` class. There seems to be a miscalculation regarding setting the x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and data ratio.

The bug seems to occur due to incorrect calculation of the x-axis limits after applying the aspect ratio. The formula for adjusting the x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and data ratio may be incorrect, leading to the mismatch in the obtained and expected results.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the x-axis limits based on the aspect ratio and data ratio in the `apply_aspect` function needs to be revised.

The following is the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_width / fig_height

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    def xlim_gen():
        yield self.get_xbound()
        yield self.get_ybound()

    if self.get_data_ratio() < 1:
        self.apply_aspect()
    else:
        xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, xlim_gen())
        aspect_ratio = (ymaxt - ymint) / (xmax - xmin)
        xr = 1.05 * (xmax - xmin)
        yr = xr / aspect_ratio
        ymid = 0.5 * (ymaxt + ymint)
        self.set_ybound(ymid - yr / 2, ymid + yr / 2)
```
