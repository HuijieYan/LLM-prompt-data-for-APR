The error is occurring in the `test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim` test case due to the incorrect behavior of the `apply_aspect` function. The assertion `assert ax.get_xlim() == pytest.approx([1*10**(1/2), 100/10**(1/2)])` fails, indicating that the function is not performing as expected.

The potential error location within the `apply_aspect` function is likely in the logic related to adjusting the x-limits and y-limits based on the aspect ratio.

The bug is occurring because the function is incorrectly adjusting the x-limits and y-limits based on the specified aspect ratio and adjustable mode. It fails to properly update the limits in accordance with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `apply_aspect` function needs to be modified to correctly calculate and set the x-limits and y-limits based on the aspect ratio and the adjustable mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:

```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()

    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())

    dx = xmax - xmin
    dy = ymax - ymin

    # Adjust limits to account for aspect ratio
    if dx / dy > aspect:  # x-dimension is too large
        new_dx = dy * aspect
        new_xmin = (xmin + xmax - new_dx) / 2
        new_xmax = new_xmin + new_dx
        self.set_xbound(x_trf.inverted().transform(new_xmin), x_trf.inverted().transform(new_xmax))
    else:  # y-dimension is too large
        new_dy = dx / aspect
        new_ymin = (ymin + ymax - new_dy) / 2
        new_ymax = new_ymin + new_dy
        self.set_ybound(y_trf.inverted().transform(new_ymin), y_trf.inverted().transform(new_ymax))
```

This corrected code should address the issues with adjusting the limits based on the aspect ratio and the adjustable mode. After applying this fix, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
