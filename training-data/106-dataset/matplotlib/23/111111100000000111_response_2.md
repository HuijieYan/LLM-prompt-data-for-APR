1. The test case mentioned in the detailed issue description includes "test_aspect_nonlinear_adjustable_datalim", which tests the behavior of the aspect ratio when the adjustable property is set to "datalim" for axes with a fixed aspect ratio.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the section where the transformation is applied to the data limits (datalims). Specifically, the use of `x_trf.inverted().transform` and `y_trf.inverted().transform` may be incorrect.

3. The bug occurs because the transformation applied to the data limits (datalims) in the `apply_aspect` function of the `_AxesBase` class is incorrect. This leads to unexpected behavior when setting the aspect ratio for axes with the adjustable property set to "datalim."

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the transformation applied to the data limits to ensure correct aspect ratio handling, especially when the adjustable property is set to "datalim."
   - Ensure that the x and y limits are adjusted appropriately based on the aspect ratio requirements.
   - Consider the impact of shared axes and handle them correctly when adjusting the limits to maintain the aspect ratio.

5. Corrected code for the `apply_aspect` function:
```python
def apply_aspect(self, position=None):
    if position is None:
        position = self.get_position(original=True)

    aspect = self.get_aspect()

    if aspect == 'auto':
        self._set_position(position, which='active')
        return

    if aspect == 'equal':
        aspect = 1

    fig_width, fig_height = self.get_figure().get_size_inches()
    fig_aspect = fig_height / fig_width

    if self._adjustable == 'box':
        if self in self._twinned_axes:
            raise RuntimeError("Adjustable 'box' is not allowed in a "
                               "twinned Axes; use 'datalim' instead")
        box_aspect = aspect * self.get_data_ratio()
        pb = position.frozen()
        pb1 = pb.shrunk_to_aspect(box_aspect, pb, fig_aspect)
        self._set_position(pb1.anchored(self.get_anchor(), pb), 'active')
        return

    # self._adjustable == 'datalim'

    # reset active to original in case it had been changed by prior use
    # of 'box'
    self._set_position(position, which='active')

    x_trf = self.xaxis.get_transform()
    y_trf = self.yaxis.get_transform()
    xmin, xmax = map(x_trf.transform, self.get_xbound())  # Update the transformation here
    ymin, ymax = map(y_trf.transform, self.get_ybound())  # Update the transformation here

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
This corrected code includes the updated transformation for `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, and `ymax` to ensure that the correct aspect ratio is applied when the adjustable property is set to "datalim."
