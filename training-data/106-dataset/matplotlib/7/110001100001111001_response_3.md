Error location: The error is likely occurring in the `shade_rgb` function, specifically in the conditional block checking for the `blend_mode` in the `lookup` dictionary. 

Reasons for the bug:
1. The function does not handle the case where the blend_mode is not found in the lookup dictionary.
2. Additionally, in the case where the intensity has a mask attribute, the function does not properly handle this situation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to handle the case where the blend_mode is not found in the lookup dictionary.
2. If the intensity has a mask attribute, the function should handle masked arrays properly to avoid errors.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }

    blend = None
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        if callable(blend_mode):
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {lookup.keys()}')

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the above corrected code, the condition has been modified to properly handle the case where blend_mode is not found in the lookup dictionary. Additionally, it checks if the blend_mode is callable and raises a ValueError if it is not. Finally, the function also handles the intensity mask attribute to avoid errors.
