The potential error in the problematic function is in the line `raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}' .format(lookup.keys)) from err`. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is attempting to call the `keys` attribute of the `lookup` dictionary, but it should instead call the `keys()` method.

To fix the bug, the correct syntax to call the `keys()` method is to include parentheses. Additionally, we should check if `blend_mode` is callable before trying to call it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
                  vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
        """
        Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
        give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        ...
        """
        # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
        
        if callable(blend_mode):
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        elif blend_mode in lookup:
            blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys()))

        # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
        if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
            mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
            for i in range(3):
                blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
    
        return blend
```
