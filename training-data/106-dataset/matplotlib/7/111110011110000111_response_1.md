Issue Analysis:
The error occurs when attempting to access the 'mask' attribute of the 'intensity' variable. The error message indicates an "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable," which suggests that 'intensity' is a scalar instead of an array.

Reasons for Bug Occurrence:
The bug occurs because 'intensity' is being computed from the 'hillshade' function but is not properly handled as an array in the 'shade_rgb' function, leading to the 'mask' attribute issue. This could be due to an incorrect assignment or return value from the 'hillshade' function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the 'hillshade' function to ensure it returns an array instead of a scalar.
2. Modify the 'shade_rgb' function to handle both scalar and array inputs for 'intensity' appropriately.
3. Improve error handling in the 'shade_rgb' function to handle different types of input for 'intensity'.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)

    # Ensure intensity is an array
    if np.isscalar(intensity):
        intensity = np.full_like(rgb, intensity)

    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
