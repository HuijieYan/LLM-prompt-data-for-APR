The bug occurs in the shade_rgb function at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. This line is trying to access the mask attribute of the intensity variable, assuming it is a 2D array with a mask. However, the intensity variable is resulting from the np.clip operation, which returns a masked array with an attribute mask=False, causing the IndexError when trying to access intensity.mask.

To fix this bug, the intensity variable should be handled differently so that it does not create a masked array with an incorrect mask attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the shade_rgb function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv', vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = np.clip(intensity, 0, 1)

    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }

    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, the np.clip operation is applied directly to the intensity variable, and the handling of masked arrays with the mask attribute is removed. This should prevent the IndexError issue related to masked arrays and fix the bug with shade_rgb producing incorrect results for masked arrays.
