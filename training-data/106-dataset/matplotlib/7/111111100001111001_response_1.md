The potential error location within the `shade_rgb` function is in the section where it attempts to check if the `intensity` variable has a `mask` attribute. This shows that the variable is expected to be a MaskedArray. However, depending on the input, the `intensity` variable might not be a MaskedArray, which causes the function to throw an error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to avoid accessing the `mask` attribute if the `intensity` variable is not a MaskedArray. We can also explicitly check if `intensity` is a MaskedArray before accessing its `mask` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.ma import MaskedArray

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
    
    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, MaskedArray) and hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
    
    return blend
```

In this corrected code, we use the `isinstance` function to first check if `intensity` is a MaskedArray before attempting to access its `mask` attribute. This ensures that the code will work for both cases where `intensity` is a regular ndarray or a MaskedArray, preventing any potential errors.
