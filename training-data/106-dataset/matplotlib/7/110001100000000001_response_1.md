Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the line `raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}' .format(lookup.keys)) from err` where the `lookup.keys` is used without calling the `keys()` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `keys` function is not being called correctly when formatting the error message.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `keys` function should be called to obtain the keys of the dictionary, and the correct usage of `keys()` function should be used.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same) ...

    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys())) from err  # call keys() function
```
