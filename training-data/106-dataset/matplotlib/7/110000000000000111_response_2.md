The error is occurring at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the `shade_rgb` function. This line is trying to access a 2D mask attribute of the intensity variable, but intensity is a 3D array with a mask attribute in a different format than expected.

The reason for the bug is that the `intensity` array is being created with a shape that includes a trailing ellipsis, which replaces one or more dimensions. This is leading to the unexpected shape of the mask attribute and causing the `IndexError` when trying to access it.

To fix the bug, the intensity array should be reshaped explicitly to ensure that the mask attribute is 2D.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
# corrected function
import numpy as np

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Reshape the intensity mask to 2D
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and intensity.mask is not np.ma.nomask:
        intensity.mask = np.broadcast_to(intensity.mask, intensity.shape[:-1])

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and intensity.mask is not np.ma.nomask:
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
