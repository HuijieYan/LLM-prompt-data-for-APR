The error seems to occur in the `shade_rgb` function when trying to access the `mask` attribute of the `intensity` variable. The error message indicates an "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable," which suggests that the `mask` attribute is being accessed incorrectly as a scalar instead of an array.

The bug occurs because the mask attribute is not being handled properly for the MaskedArray type. When the input elevation array is a MaskedArray, the `self.hillshade` function returns a MaskedArray for `intensity` with a mask. However, the buggy code does not account for this mask when trying to access it later, resulting in the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to check for the presence of a mask before trying to access it. If the mask is present, we should use it to mask the intensity array.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and not intensity.mask.all():  # Check if mask is present and not all values are masked
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `intensity` array has a mask and if all values are not masked. Then, we use the mask to apply the result where hillshade intensity isn't masked.

This should fix the bug and prevent the IndexError when accessing the `mask` attribute of the intensity variable.
