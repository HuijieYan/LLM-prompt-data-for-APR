The error occurs in the `shade_rgb` function on line 1943, specifically with the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. The error is caused by `intensity` being a scalar instead of an array, which makes the slicing operation in `intensity.mask[..., 0]` invalid.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `intensity` is an array before attempting to access its mask. We can do this by explicitly converting `intensity` to a masked array using `np.ma.array()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as the original function)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = np.ma.array(intensity, mask=np.isnan(intensity))

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly convert `intensity` to a masked array using `np.ma.array()`, and we set its mask using `np.isnan(intensity)`. This ensures that `intensity` is treated as an array with a valid mask, allowing the subsequent operations to work correctly.
