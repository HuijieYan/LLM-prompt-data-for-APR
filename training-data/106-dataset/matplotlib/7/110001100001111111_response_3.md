The issue is occurring at the line: `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the `shade_rgb` function. This error is being caused by the use of `intensity.mask` on a MaskedArray object, which in this context returns a scalar element.

This bug occurs because when `shade_rgb` expects a 2D mask for the input intensity, it encounters a 0-dimensional mask, leading to an "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable."

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `shade_rgb` function to handle the case when the `intensity` array has a 0-dimensional mask.

We can fix the bug by explicitly checking for the presence of a mask in the `intensity` array, and if it exists, we should handle it appropriately. In the case of a 0-dimensional mask, we should convert it to a 2D mask before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Check if intensity has a mask and convert it to a 2D mask if necessary
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        if intensity.mask.ndim == 0:
            intensity.mask = np.broadcast_to(intensity.mask, intensity.shape)

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

With this modification, the issue of the "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable" should be resolved. This fix explicitly checks for the dimensionality of the mask in the `intensity` array and handles it appropriately, ensuring that the function works correctly with both regular arrays and MaskedArrays.
