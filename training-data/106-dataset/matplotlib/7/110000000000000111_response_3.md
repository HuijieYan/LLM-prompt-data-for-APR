The error occurs in the `shade_rgb` function at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. The error message indicates that there is an "invalid index to scalar variable".

This error occurs because the `intensity` variable is calculated as a 2D array with shape `(M, N)`, but later it is used as if it were a 3D array with a mask attribute. This discrepancy leads to the attempted indexing at `[..., 0]` that results in the "invalid index to scalar variable" error.

To fix this, the `intensity` array should be reshaped to add a third dimension before using it with the mask attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.
    
    ... (other parameters and docstrings remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity.reshape((intensity.shape[0], intensity.shape[1], 1))  # Reshape to add a third dimension

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask  # Changed to simply intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
