The error is likely occurring within the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class in the `matplotlib.colors` module. The error message `IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable` suggests that there is an attempt to index a scalar variable as an array, which is not allowed.

The reason behind this bug is that the `intensity` variable is being treated as an array, but in some cases, it could be a scalar, leading to the `IndexError`. This happens when the `intensity` is calculated and doesn't have a mask attribute, causing the subsequent code to fail.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to explicitly handle the case where `intensity` is a scalar and doesn't have a mask attribute.

Here is the corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rgb : array-like
        An (M, N, 3) RGB array, assumed to be in the range of 0 to 1.
    elevation : array-like
        An (M, N) array of the height values used to generate a shaded map.
    fraction : number
        Increases or decreases the contrast of the hillshade.  Values
        greater than one will cause intermediate values to move closer to
        full illumination or shadow (and clipping any values that move
        beyond 0 or 1). Note that this is not visually or mathematically
        the same as vertical exaggeration.
    blend_mode : {'hsv', 'overlay', 'soft'} or callable, optional
        The type of blending used to combine the colormapped data values
        with the illumination intensity.  For backwards compatibility, this
        defaults to "hsv". Note that for most topographic surfaces,
        "overlay" or "soft" appear more visually realistic. If a
        user-defined function is supplied, it is expected to combine an
        MxNx3 RGB array of floats (ranging 0 to 1) with an MxNx1 hillshade
        array (also 0 to 1).  (Call signature
        ``func(rgb, illum, **kwargs)``)
        Additional kwargs supplied to this function will be passed on to
        the *blend_mode* function.
    vert_exag : number, optional
        The amount to exaggerate the elevation values by when calculating
        illumination. This can be used either to correct for differences in
        units between the x-y coordinate system and the elevation
        coordinate system (e.g. decimal degrees vs. meters) or to
        exaggerate or de-emphasize topography.
    dx : number, optional
        The x-spacing (columns) of the input *elevation* grid.
    dy : number, optional
        The y-spacing (rows) of the input *elevation* grid.
    Additional kwargs are passed on to the *blend_mode* function.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        if mask.ndim < 3:  # Check if mask is a scalar or 2D array
            mask = mask[..., np.newaxis]
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check the dimensionality of the `mask` attribute and handle the case where it is a scalar. This should prevent the `IndexError` when indexing the `mask` attribute.
