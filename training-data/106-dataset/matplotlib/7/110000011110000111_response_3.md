The error occurred in the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class. The error message indicates that the issue is with the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`, specifically an IndexError due to an invalid index to a scalar variable.

The reason for the bug is that `intensity` is a masked array, and when accessing its `mask` attribute, it is expecting a 2D mask, but it is not finding it.

To fix this bug, we can check if the `intensity` is a masked array. If it is, then we need to access the mask attribute differently.

Here's the corrected `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ...  # rest of the parameters remain the same

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend_aux = blend[..., i]
            rgb_aux = rgb[..., i]
            blend_aux[mask] = rgb_aux[mask]

    return blend
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `intensity` has a mask attribute. If it does, we directly use it to mask the `blend` array.

This way, we address the issue of accessing the mask attribute incorrectly for the intensity masked array.
