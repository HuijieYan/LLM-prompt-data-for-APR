The error occurs at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]` in the `shade_rgb` method. This error indicates that `intensity.mask` is a scalar value and cannot be indexed using `[...]`.

The bug is likely occurring because `intensity.mask` is a scalar value rather than an array or it might not have the expected shape. This could be due to an issue with the calculation of the intensity or the `hillshade` function.

To fix this bug, you should ensure that `intensity.mask` is an array before attempting to index it. You can check if `intensity` has a mask and then assign it to `mask` accordingly.

Here's the corrected `shade_rgb` method:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError(f'"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {lookup.keys()}') from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
