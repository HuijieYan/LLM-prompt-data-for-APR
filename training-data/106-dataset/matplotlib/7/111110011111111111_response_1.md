The issue occurs in the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class. The error message indicates an "IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable". This error occurs when trying to access the `mask` attribute of `intensity` using `intensity.mask[..., 0]`. The `mask` attribute of `intensity` is expected to be 2D, but it seems like it is a scalar, leading to the IndexError.

The bug occurs because the mask attribute of a masked array has a different structure than a regular array. The shaded array intensity does not retain its mask after calculations, and as a result, accessing the mask as if it were a property of the result is not feasible.

The potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking if `intensity` is an instance of a MaskedArray and using `np.ma.array` to create a MaskedArray when `intensity` is not already a MaskedArray.
2. Modifying the way the mask is extracted from `intensity` to handle both regular arrays and masked arrays.

The corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:
```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    ... (other comments and docstrings)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray):
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
    return blend
