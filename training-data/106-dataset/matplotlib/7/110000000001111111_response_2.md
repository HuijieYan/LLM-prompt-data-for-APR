Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `shade_rgb` function at the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. It seems that the `intensity` variable is a masked array with a mask attribute, but the code assumes this mask attribute is 2D. This leads to the IndexError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes the mask attribute of the intensity variable is a 2D array, but in the buggy cases, the intensity.mask attribute is not a 2D array.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To address this bug, the code needs to be updated to handle the case where the mask attribute is not a 2D array. The mask attribute should be checked for its dimensionality before being accessed in the code.

Corrected code for the `shade_rgb` function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    Use this light source to adjust the colors of the *rgb* input array to
    give the impression of a shaded relief map with the given *elevation*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as the original function)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        An (m, n, 3) array of floats ranging between 0-1.
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask') and intensity.mask.ndim == 2:  # Check for 2D mask
        # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
        lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,

        if blend_mode in lookup:

        else:

            except TypeError as err:

                                 .format(lookup.keys)) from err

        # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
        mask = intensity.mask
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]
