The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `shade_rgb` method of the `LightSource` class. The error specifically mentions an "IndexError" related to trying to access an invalid index on a scalar variable.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue arises from the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. The variable `intensity` is a scalar, and accessing `mask` attribute with the invalid index `[..., 0]` is causing the IndexError.

This bug occurs because the `shade_rgb` method assumes that the `intensity` variable will always have a mask attribute, which is not the case when `intensity` is a scalar. To fix this, the code should first check if `intensity` is a masked array before attempting to access its mask attribute.

To address this issue, we can modify the code in the `shade_rgb` method to include a check for whether `intensity` is a masked array. If it is, then the mask can be accessed; otherwise, the code should handle the scalar intensity without assuming the presence of a mask attribute.

The corrected code for the `shade_rgb` method is as follows:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    lookup = {
        'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
        'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
        'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
    }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask if isinstance(intensity, np.ma.MaskedArray) else False
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
