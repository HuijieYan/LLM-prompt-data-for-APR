The issue seems to be with the `intensity` variable in the `shade_rgb` function, specifically the line `mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]`. This is likely causing an `IndexError` because the `intensity` array is not structured as expected.

The bug likely occurs because the `intensity` variable is being assumed to have a `mask` attribute, but it is not being properly handled as a masked array.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to check if `intensity` is a masked array before trying to access its `mask` attribute. If it is a masked array, then we can use the mask as intended. If it's not a masked array, we can continue without using the mask.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def shade_rgb(self, rgb, elevation, fraction=1., blend_mode='hsv',
              vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, **kwargs):
    """
    ... (same docstring as before) ...
    """
    # Calculate the "hillshade" intensity.
    intensity = self.hillshade(elevation, vert_exag, dx, dy, fraction)
    intensity = intensity[..., np.newaxis]

    # Check if intensity is a masked array
    if hasattr(intensity, 'mask'):
        mask = intensity.mask[..., 0]
    else:
        mask = None

    # Blend the hillshade and rgb data using the specified mode
    lookup = {
            'hsv': self.blend_hsv,
            'soft': self.blend_soft_light,
            'overlay': self.blend_overlay,
            }
    if blend_mode in lookup:
        blend = lookup[blend_mode](rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
    else:
        try:
            blend = blend_mode(rgb, intensity, **kwargs)
        except TypeError as err:
            raise ValueError('"blend_mode" must be callable or one of {}'
                             .format(lookup.keys)) from err

    # Only apply result where hillshade intensity isn't masked
    if mask is not None:
        for i in range(3):
            blend[..., i][mask] = rgb[..., i][mask]

    return blend
```
