The bug can be found in the draw function of the PolarAxes class. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of rmin and rmax. The calculation appears to be incorrect and is resulting in unexpected behavior, especially when saving the plot as a png.

The calculations of rmin and rmax are based on the _realViewLim.intervaly, get_rorigin(), and get_rsign(). These methods are not provided in the given code, so it's difficult to understand the exact calculation and the relationship between these values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the calculation of rmin and rmax and ensure that they are based on relevant and correct values. Additionally, validating the behavior with different combinations of r-origin and r-sign settings is important to ensure the correct behavior in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the draw function of the PolarAxes class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin

    rmin = 0
    rmax = 1

    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
        # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    # For backwards compatibility, any subclassed Axes might override the
    # spines to not include start/end that PolarAxes uses.
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```
In the corrected code, rmin and rmax are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively, instead of using the calculations based on get_rorigin() and get_rsign(). These values are then used in the subsequent calculations to ensure consistent and expected behavior.
