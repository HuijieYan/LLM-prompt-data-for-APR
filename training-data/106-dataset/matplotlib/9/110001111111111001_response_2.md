The error message indicates that the actual and expected images are not matching, with an RMS (Root Mean Square) value of 6.526. This means that the visualization produced by the function is different from what was expected. The source of the problem seems to be related to the drawing of the polar plot, especially the handling of inverted y-limits and the setting of rorigin.

The bug is likely occurring in the draw method of the PolarAxes class. The variables rmin and rmax are calculated based on the inverted y-axis limits, and rmin is expected to be larger than rmax. However, based on the input values, rmin has a value of 1.0 and rmax has a value of 3.0. This indicates a bug in the calculation of these values.

To fix the bug, the rmin and rmax calculation needs to be revised to ensure that inverted y-limits are properly handled. Additionally, the correct setting of rorigin is essential for polar plots.

Here's the corrected code for the draw method:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.degrees(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rorigin = self.get_rorigin()
    rsign = self.get_rsign()
    rmin, rmax = rsign * (rorigin - self.get_ylim()[0]), rsign * (rorigin - self.get_ylim()[1])
    
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
        # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        radius = 0.5 * (rmax - rmin)
        width = 0.25 * radius
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we calculate rmin and rmax using the inverted y-limits and rorigin. Additionally, we adjust the calculation of radius and width for the polar plot to ensure that the visualization is correct, especially when dealing with inverted y-limits.
