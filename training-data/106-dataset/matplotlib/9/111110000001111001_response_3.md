The potential error in the given function is in the calculation of `rmin` and `rmax`. It seems that the calculation is incorrect and that's why the `rmin` variable does not have the expected value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be a miscalculation or incorrect formula applied to the calculation of `rmin` and `rmax`.

To fix the bug, the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax` needs to be reviewed and corrected. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
        
    rorigin = self.get_rorigin()  # get the rorigin first
    rsign = self.get_rsign()  # get the rsign
    
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - rorigin) * rsign)  # correct the calculation
    
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # all other code remains unchanged
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(thetamin)
        self.patch.set_theta2(thetamax)

        edge, _ = self.transWedge.transform((1, 0))
        radius = edge - center[0]
        width = min(radius * (rmax - rmin) / rmax, radius)
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)
        
    # all other code remains unchanged
```
