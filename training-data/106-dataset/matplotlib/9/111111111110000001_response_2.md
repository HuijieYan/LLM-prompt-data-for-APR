The error message indicates that the images being compared in the test_polar_invertedylim_rorigin function are not close. This suggests that there is a problem with the code related to the polar graph projection, leading to the incorrect output.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the draw method of the PolarAxes class. This method is responsible for drawing the polar graph, and there seems to be a bug in the calculations related to the angles (thetamin and thetamax) and the radius values.

The bug occurs because the calculations for the angle range (thetamin and thetamax) and the radius values are not being performed correctly. This leads to incorrect positioning of the polar plot elements, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual images.

To fix the bug, the calculations for the angle range and radius values need to be corrected. Additionally, the setting of the rorigin and inverted y-axis should be taken into account to ensure the correct placement of the polar plot elements.

Here's the corrected code for the draw method of the PolarAxes class:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin
    rmin, rmax = ((self._realViewLim.intervaly - self.get_rorigin()) * self.get_rsign())
    
    if isinstance(self.patch, mpatches.Wedge):
        # Backwards-compatibility: Any subclassed Axes might override the
        # patch to not be the Wedge that PolarAxes uses.
        center = self.transWedge.transform((0.5, 0.5))
        self.patch.set_center(center)
        self.patch.set_theta1(np.deg2rad(thetamin))  # Convert thetas to radians
        self.patch.set_theta2(np.deg2rad(thetamax))  # Convert thetas to radians

        # Calculate radius and width
        radius = rmax
        width = rmax - rmin
        self.patch.set_radius(radius)
        self.patch.set_width(width)

        inner_width = radius - width
        inner = self.spines.get('inner', None)
        if inner:
            inner.set_visible(inner_width != 0.0)

    visible = not _is_full_circle_deg(thetamin, thetamax)
    # For backwards compatibility, any subclassed Axes might override the
    # spines to not include start/end that PolarAxes uses.
    start = self.spines.get('start', None)
    end = self.spines.get('end', None)
    if start:
        start.set_visible(visible)
    if end:
        end.set_visible(visible)
    if visible:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._yaxis_transform
    else:
        yaxis_text_transform = self._r_label_position + self.transData
    if self._yaxis_text_transform != yaxis_text_transform:
        self._yaxis_text_transform.set(yaxis_text_transform)
        self.yaxis.reset_ticks()
        self.yaxis.set_clip_path(self.patch)

    Axes.draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, the angles thetamin and thetamax are converted to radians before setting the wedge's theta values. Additionally, the radius and width calculations are corrected to ensure the proper placement of the polar plot elements.
