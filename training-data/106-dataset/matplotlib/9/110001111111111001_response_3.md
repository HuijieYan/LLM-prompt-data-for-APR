The bug seems to be present in the `draw` function of the `PolarAxes` class. This function is responsible for drawing the polar plot with specific configurations.

The error message from the test function implies that the generated image does not match the expected one. This suggests a problem with the layout or appearance of the polar plot when using inverted y-axis and setting r-origin.

Upon inspecting the code, it seems that the problem lies in the logic used to calculate the values for `rmin` and `rmax`. The calculation is performed using `self.get_rorigin()` and `self.get_rsign()`.

The reason for the bug may be related to incorrect calculations for `rmin` and `rmax`, which could affect the appearance of the polar plot, especially when y-axis inversion and r-origin settings are applied.

To fix the bug, the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax` needs to be reviewed, ensuring that it accurately reflects the intended behavior when y-axis inversion and r-origin settings are applied.

Here's the corrected code for the `draw` function:

```python
def draw(self, renderer, *args, **kwargs):
    thetamin, thetamax = np.rad2deg(self._realViewLim.intervalx)
    if thetamin > thetamax:
        thetamin, thetamax = thetamax, thetamin

    rmin = self.get_rorigin()  # corrected calculation for rmin
    rmax = self.viewLim.intervaly[1]  # corrected calculation for rmax

    # (remaining code unchanged)
```

In this corrected code, `rmin` is directly obtained from `self.get_rorigin()`, and `rmax` is obtained from `self.viewLim.intervaly[1]`.

By correcting the calculation for `rmin` and `rmax`, the polar plot should render correctly, and the test case should pass without generating an error message.
