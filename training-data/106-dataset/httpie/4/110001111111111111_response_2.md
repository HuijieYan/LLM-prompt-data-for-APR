The error in the buggy function is that it's adding the 'Host' header twice under certain conditions, leading to duplicate headers. This behavior is not expected as it can cause issues with HTTP requests.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't properly check if the 'Host' header already exists before adding it. It should only add the 'Host' header if it doesn't already exist in the headers dict. Additionally, the function should ensure that the 'Host' header is added with the correct casing, as the test case highlights the importance of proper casing.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified as follows:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    host_header_exists = any(name.lower() == 'host' for name in headers)  # Check if 'Host' header already exists

    if not host_header_exists:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]  # Add 'Host' header if it doesn't already exist

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]
    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if not isinstance(headers, str):  # Convert to string if it's not already
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')

    return headers
```

With these changes, the function will properly check if the 'Host' header already exists and only add it if it doesn't. This should resolve the issue of duplicate headers being added. Additionally, the function should always ensure the correct casing for the 'Host' header to align with the test case's expectations.
