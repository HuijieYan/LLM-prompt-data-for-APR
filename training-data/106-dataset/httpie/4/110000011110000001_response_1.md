The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion `assert r.lower().count('host:') == 1` failed. The count for 'host:' in the response was 2 instead of 1, which is what caused the assertion error.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the manipulation of the 'Host' header. It seems that the code is not correctly handling the 'Host' header, which is causing the assertion error in the test function.

The bug occurs because the original function tries to insert the 'Host' header into the headers dictionary using a different method than the other headers. This results in the 'Host' header not being correctly handled, leading to the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the 'Host' header in the same way as the other headers. This can be achieved by using a consistent method for handling all headers in the headers dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_str = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers_str.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers_str).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In the corrected code, the 'Host' header is now consistently handled with other headers, and the error should be resolved.
