The bug occurs in the property `headers` of the `HTTPRequest` class. The function is supposed to generate and return the HTTP headers based on the request information. However, the bug arises from the fact that the function is constructing headers based on the url and other request information, but then it's unnecessarily converting them into a single string and checking if it's a bytes object and then decoding it.

The unnecessary step of converting headers to a single string and checking for bytes type can lead to incorrect output and potentially throw errors.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary conversion and checking for bytes type should be removed from the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers_list = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    return headers_list
```

By removing the unnecessary conversion to a single string and the check for bytes type, the corrected code eliminates the possibility of incorrect output or errors.
