Potential error location within the problematic function:
The bug is likely to be in the headers function of the HTTPRequest class. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the Host header.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the headers function is trying to add the 'Host' header to the headers dictionary, but it's adding it as the first header in the list. This causes the duplication of the 'Host' header in the request, leading to the test failure.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the 'Host' header is added to the headers dictionary. It should be added to the beginning of the headers list, but in a way that does not lead to duplication. Additionally, the check for the 'Host' header should be performed in a way that prevents it from being added again if it already exists.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Check if 'Host' exists in headers
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]
    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers_updated = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers_updated, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers_updated = headers_updated.decode('utf8')
    return headers_updated
```
