The test function `test_Host_header_overwrite` checks whether the Host header is overwritten by sending a request to `httpbin.org/get`. The error occurs because the `Host` header is not being modified correctly in the `headers` property function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block:
```python
if 'Host' not in headers:
    headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
```
This block is supposed to add the `Host` header if it does not exist in the headers dictionary. However, the `url.netloc` being used might not always be the intended domain name.

The reason behind the bug is that the `headers` property function does not handle the `Host` header correctly for all cases. It simply takes the `netloc` from the URL and sets it directly, but this might contain additional information that is not the intended domain name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Parse the host from the URL with the correct methods rather than accessing the `netloc` directly.
2. Ensure that the `Host` header contains only the specific domain without any additional information that might come from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property function:
```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.hostname  # Using `hostname` to extract just the host

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
In the corrected code, `url.hostname` is used to get only the host component without any additional information from the URL. This should ensure that the `Host` header is set correctly for the given URL.
