The error occurs in the `test_Host_header_overwrite` function, where it is expected that there should be only one occurrence of the 'Host:' header in the response. However, the actual response contains two occurrences of the 'Host:' header, leading to the assertion error.

The bug is caused by the `headers` function in the `HTTPRequest` class. The `if 'Host' not in headers` condition is adding a new 'Host' header if it's not already present, but it's not replacing the existing 'Host' header if it is present. This results in duplicate 'Host' headers in the final output.

To fix the bug, the code should check if 'Host' is already present in the headers, and if so, replace its value with the one from the URL's netloc. If 'Host' is not present, then it should be added to the headers with the correct value.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc
    else:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

With this correction, the 'Host' header will be replaced if it already exists, and added if it doesn't, ensuring that there will be only one 'Host' header in the final output.
