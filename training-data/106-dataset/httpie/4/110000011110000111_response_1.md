The error message from the test function indicates that there are two Host headers in the request instead of one. This is likely caused by the buggy `headers` function that is not handling the custom Host header specified in the test case properly.

The potential error location within the `headers` function is the code block that checks if 'Host' is in the headers and adds it if it's not. This is likely causing the duplication of the Host header.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where a custom Host header is specified. It only checks for the existence of the 'Host' header and adds it if it's not present, without considering the possibility of a custom Host header being already present.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `headers` function to properly handle the custom Host header specified in the test case. We can first remove the 'Host' header if it's present in the headers, and then add the custom Host header if it's specified in the HTTP request.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Remove the 'Host' header if it's present
    if 'Host' in headers:
        del headers['Host']

    # Add the custom Host header if it's specified
    custom_host_header = 'host: ' + url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    headers['Host'] = custom_host_header

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

This updated code should handle the custom Host header specified in the test case correctly and prevent duplicating the Host header in the request.
