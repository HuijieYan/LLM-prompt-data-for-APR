1. The test case is checking whether the 'Host' header is overwritten in the HTTP request. It expects the count of 'host:' in the output to be 1, but it is actually 2, leading to the assertion error.

2. The potential error location is within the `headers` property of the class that is being tested.

3. The bug occurs because the 'Host' header is being added unconditionally, regardless of whether it already exists. This causes the 'Host' header to be duplicated in the HTTP request, resulting in the count being 2 instead of 1.

4. To fix the bug, we can check if the 'Host' header already exists in the headers dictionary before adding it. If it does, we don't need to add it again. If it doesn't, then we add it.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        del headers['Host']  # Remove the existing Host header

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

By checking if the 'Host' header exists before adding it, we ensure that it's not duplicated in the HTTP request.
