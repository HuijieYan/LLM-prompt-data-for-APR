The error seems to be related to the `test_Host_header_overwrite` test case. The test is expecting only one occurrence of the 'Host' header in the response, but it is finding two occurrences. This indicates that the headers are being duplicated when a custom host is specified.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling the 'Host' header. It seems that when a custom host is specified, the 'Host' header is being added twice, resulting in duplication.

The bug is likely occurring because the code is not properly checking whether the 'Host' header is already present before adding it. This results in adding a duplicate 'Host' header when a custom host is specified.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the 'Host' header is already present in the headers and only add it if it is not. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for handling the 'Host' header in the `headers` property.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:  # Check if 'Host' header is already present
        if url.netloc:  # Check if netloc is present in the URL
            headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')

    return headers
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'Host' header is already present in the headers. If it is not present, then we proceed to add it based on the netloc from the URL. This should prevent the duplication of headers when a custom host is specified.

With this fix, the `test_Host_header_overwrite` test case should pass without encountering the duplicated 'Host' header issue.
