Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the `headers` function due to the manipulation of the `Host` header.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the if statement inside the function is checking for the presence of the 'Host' header in the `headers` dictionary. If it is not present, then a new 'Host' header is added using `url.netloc.split('@')[-1]` which contains the IP address. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior as the 'Host' header should contain the host name, not the IP address.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to correct the 'Host' header assignment to use the actual host name instead of the IP address.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
By assigning `headers['Host']` to `url.netloc` instead of the IP address, the corrected function should resolve the bug and properly set the 'Host' header with the appropriate host name.
