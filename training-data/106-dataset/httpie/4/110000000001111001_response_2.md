The bug in the provided code seems to be that the 'Host' header is being added to the headers dictionary but not included in the final headers string. This is indicated by the fact that the 'Host' header is being added, but the code does not account for it in the final string construction.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to include the 'Host' header in the final headers string. This can be done by checking if 'Host' is in the headers dictionary and, if so, appending it to the headers list before joining it into the final headers string.

Additionally, the code uses binary strings (bytes) in the final string construction. These should be decoded to regular strings before returning.

Here's the corrected code for the headers method:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]

    if 'Host' in headers:
        headers_list.insert(1, 'Host: %s' % headers['Host'])

    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers_str = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers_str, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers_str = headers_str.decode('utf8')
    return headers_str
```

In the corrected code, the 'Host' header is added to the headers list if it exists, and the list is then joined into the final headers string. The binary string check and decoding are also included to handle Python 2 compatibility.
