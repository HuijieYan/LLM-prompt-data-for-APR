The bug seems to be in the `headers` property of the `HTTPRequest` class. The `headers` property is supposed to return a formatted HTTP header string, but the bug causes it to not include the 'Host' header if it's present in the original request's headers.

The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion `assert r.lower().count('host:') == 1` fails. This means that the 'Host' header is not being included only once in the HTTP headers, which is expected according to the bug.

The bug occurs because the 'Host' header is not added to the `headers` property before the property is returned, resulting in the 'Host' header value not being present.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `headers` property to ensure that the 'Host' header is included in the HTTP headers. We can achieve this by adding a condition to check if the 'Host' header is present and, if not, add it to the headers.

Here's the corrected code for the `headers` property:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )
    
    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    
    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]
    
    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    
    # Add 'Host' header if not already present
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers_list.insert(1, 'Host: ' + url.netloc)
    
    headers_str = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()
    
    if isinstance(headers_str, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers_str = headers_str.decode('utf8')
    
    return headers_str
```

With this fix, the 'Host' header is appropriately added to the list of headers if it's not already present, ensuring that it's always included in the returned HTTP headers.
