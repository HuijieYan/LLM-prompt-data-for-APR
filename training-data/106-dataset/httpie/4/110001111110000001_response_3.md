The test function "test_Host_header_overwrite" is trying to verify that the "Host" header is overwritten correctly when making an HTTP request to a specific URL. The test case is expecting the "Host" header to be present only once in the request.

The error message indicates that the test is failing because it found two occurrences of the "Host:" header in the response, rather than the expected one.

The buggy function that needs to be fixed is the "headers" property defined in the provided code. The issue seems to be with how the "Host" header is handled within the function.

The bug is likely occurring because the "Host" header is added to the headers dictionary without checking if it already exists. This causes the header to be duplicated if it is already present in the original request.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the "Host" header already exists in the headers dictionary. If it does, we should update its value instead of adding a new header. If it doesn't exist, then we can add the "Host" header to the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the "headers" property function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc  # Update the value of the 'Host' header

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers_str = '\r\n'.join(headers_list).strip()

    if isinstance(headers_str, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers_str = headers_str.decode('utf8')
    return headers_str
```

With this correction, the "Host" header will be updated if it already exists in the request, and it will only appear once in the final headers string, as expected by the test case.
