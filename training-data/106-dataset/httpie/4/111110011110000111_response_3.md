The error message from the test function indicates that there are duplicate Host headers when a custom Host is specified. This aligns with the GitHub issue title "Duplicate Host headers when custom Host specified". The test function specifically checks whether the number of occurrences of 'Host:' in the output is equal to 1, but it is currently 2, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the Host header. The function in question is extracting and modifying the headers, including the Host header, and generating a request line. This process is not correctly handling the case when a custom Host is specified.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling and addition of the Host header by the function. The function is not properly checking if a custom Host is specified and is adding a new Host header regardless, resulting in duplicate headers.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly check if a custom Host header is specified and then modify the existing header rather than adding a new one. This can be achieved by properly parsing the command line input and checking for the presence of a custom Host header.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)
    
    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )
    
    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)
    
    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    # Check for custom Host header
    if 'host' in headers:
        headers['Host'] = headers['host']
        del headers['host']

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]
    
    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()
    
    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
With this correction, the function correctly checks for the presence of a custom Host header and modifies the existing Host header if necessary, ensuring that duplicate Host headers are not added.
