Upon analyzing the test case and the error message, it seems that the `test_Host_header_overwrite` is testing the `Host` header overwrite functionality by making an HTTP request to a URL and verifying the presence of the `Host` header in the response.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert r.lower().count('host:') == 1` has failed. This means that the response `r` contains the substring 'host:' more than once, which contradicts the expected behavior.

Upon reviewing the code in the `headers` method provided, the bug seems to be related to the construction of the headers for the HTTP request. Specifically, the original `Host` header value is being overwritten in the `headers` dictionary, resulting in duplicate occurrences of the `Host` header in the HTTP request.

To fix this bug, the approach would be to check if the `Host` header is already present in the `headers` dictionary before adding it. If present, it should not be overwritten. Additionally, the `headers` list should be modified to ensure that duplicate headers are not added.

The corrected code for the `headers` method is as follows:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    unique_headers = []
    for name, value in headers.items():
        header_str = '%s: %s' % (name, value)
        if header_str not in unique_headers:
            unique_headers.append(header_str)

    unique_headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(unique_headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
        
    return headers
```

In the corrected code, the `headers` list has been replaced with `unique_headers`, which ensures that only unique headers are added to the list. Additionally, the `Host` header is only added if it is not already present in the `headers` dictionary. These changes should prevent the duplication of the `Host` header and resolve the bug.
