The error mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to the duplication of Host headers when a custom Host is specified in the HTTP request. The error seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the Host header in the provided function.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the function is the segment where the Host header is being added to the headers dictionary. It seems that the logic for inserting the Host header is not correctly handling cases where a custom Host is specified.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly checking for the existence of a custom Host header before adding it to the headers dictionary. As a result, when a custom Host header is specified, it is being added in addition to the default Host header, leading to duplicate Host headers in the final request.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check if a custom Host header has been specified and only then add it to the headers dictionary. Additionally, it should properly handle cases where the command line option casing is not correct.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    custom_host = False
    for name in headers:
        if name.lower() == 'host':
            custom_host = True
            break

    if not custom_host:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

This corrected code now properly checks if a custom Host header has been specified and only adds it to the headers dictionary if it doesn't already exist. This should prevent the duplication of Host headers as reported in the GitHub issue.
