The problem in the provided function is that it is not properly updating the "Host" header when a custom Host is specified. This results in duplicate headers in the request.

One potential error location is the section of code that checks if the "Host" header is already present and updates it if it is not.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking for the presence of the "Host" header and updating it accordingly. It results in duplicate "Host" headers in the final request.

One approach to fixing the bug is to properly check if the "Host" header is present in the headers and update it if it is not. Additionally, the function should ensure that the case of the "Host" header is consistent to avoid duplicate headers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers_list = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers_list.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers_list)

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
