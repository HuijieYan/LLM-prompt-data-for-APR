Potential error location:
The error occurs in the if condition where the 'Host' header is added to the headers dictionary. It does not check for the case sensitivity of 'Host' and may result in duplicate headers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case sensitivity of the 'Host' header. This results in duplicate headers being added if the casing of the command line option is not correct.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the existence of 'Host' header in a case-insensitive manner before adding it.
2. Update the code to ensure that only one 'Host' header is present in the headers dictionary.

Corrected code:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    # Check for the existence of 'Host' header in a case-insensitive manner
    if not any(header.lower() == 'host' for header in headers.keys()):
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value) for name, value in headers.items()]
    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if a header with the key 'Host' already exists in the headers dictionary in a case-insensitive manner. If not, the 'Host' header is added. This ensures that only one 'Host' header is present in the headers.
