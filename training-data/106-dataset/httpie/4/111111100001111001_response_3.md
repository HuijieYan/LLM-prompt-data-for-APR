Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring at the line where the 'Host' header is being added to the headers dictionary. It seems that the 'Host' header is being added in a case-insensitive manner, which is not the intended behavior.

Reason for the Bug: The bug might be occurring because the 'Host' header is being added using a case-sensitive comparison, leading to the incorrect addition of the 'Host' header.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, we need to add the 'Host' header to the headers dictionary using a case-insensitive comparison to ensure that it is added correctly.

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in (name.lower() for name in headers):
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
