The bug seems to be related to the handling of the Host header when it is overridden with a custom value. The error message indicates that if the casing of the command line option isn't correct, it results in duplicate Host headers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the if condition where it checks if 'Host' is not in headers. This condition is being checked without considering the case sensitivity of 'Host' header.

The bug occurs because the function does not check for the case sensitivity when checking if 'Host' is in headers. This results in duplicate Host headers being added when the custom Host header is specified with different casing.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check for the case sensitivity of 'Host' header when adding it to the headers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    host_header_exists = any(header[0].lower() == 'host' for header in headers.items())

    if not host_header_exists:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```

In the corrected code, we use the `any` function to check if any header with lowercased name 'host' exists in the headers. If it doesn't exist, then we add the 'Host' header with the specified value. This ensures that duplicate Host headers are not added when the custom Host header is specified with different casing.
