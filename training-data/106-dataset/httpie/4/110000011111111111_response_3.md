Potential error location: The bug seems to occur in the `headers` property function where the "Host" header is added regardless of whether it is already present in the headers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the condition to check if the "Host" header is already present is missing. As a result, the "Host" header gets added multiple times, leading to duplicate headers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the "Host" header is already present in the headers dictionary before adding it.
2. If the "Host" header is present, update its value with the netloc value from the URL. If it is not present, add it to the headers.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@property
def headers(self):
    url = urlsplit(self._orig.url)

    request_line = '{method} {path}{query} HTTP/1.1'.format(
        method=self._orig.method,
        path=url.path or '/',
        query='?' + url.query if url.query else ''
    )

    headers = dict(self._orig.headers)

    if 'Host' not in headers:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc.split('@')[-1]
    else:
        headers['Host'] = url.netloc

    headers = ['%s: %s' % (name, value)
               for name, value in headers.items()]

    headers.insert(0, request_line)
    headers = '\r\n'.join(headers).strip()

    if isinstance(headers, bytes):
        # Python < 3
        headers = headers.decode('utf8')
    return headers
```
