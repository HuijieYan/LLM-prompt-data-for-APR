The `update_headers` function is attempting to decode the `value` using the `decode` method, but it is not accounting for the case where the value is None. This is resulting in the AttributeError.

The bug is likely occurring on this line:
```python
value = value.decode('utf8')
```

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is None before attempting to decode it. If it is None, we can skip the decoding step.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this corrected code, we first check if the `value` is not None before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
