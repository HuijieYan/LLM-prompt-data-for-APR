The error is occurring on line 104 of the provided function, specifically with the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. The error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` indicates that the value being passed to the `update_headers` function is `None`. 

This is happening because in the input parameter `request_headers`, the value for the key `'Accept-Encoding'` is `None`. When the loop reaches this key-value pair and tries to decode the value, it throws an AttributeError because `None` does not have a `decode` method.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to skip the decoding process if the value is `None`. Additionally, there is a logical error in the code where it checks for certain prefixes to be ignored, but then it doesn't handle the case where the name doesn't start with those prefixes. 

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')  # Decode the value unless it's None
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this corrected code, we added a check to skip the decoding process if the value is `None`, and we adjusted the logic to correctly handle the case where the name doesn't start with the ignored prefixes.
