The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute `decode`. This means that the `value` in the `update_headers` method is None, which is causing the AttributeError. This is likely due to the way the `request_headers` dictionary is being constructed or passed to the method.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `request_headers` dictionary is properly constructed and passed as an argument to the `update_headers` method. Additionally, we should handle the case where the `value` is None before attempting to call the `decode` method on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check if the `value` is not None before attempting to decode it. If it is not None, then we proceed to decode it. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
