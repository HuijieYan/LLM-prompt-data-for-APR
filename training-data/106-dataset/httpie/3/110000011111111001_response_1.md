Potential error location: 

The error occurs within the `update_headers` function at the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'decode', which means that the value being passed is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The error occurs when `request_headers` contains the key 'Accept-Encoding' with a value of None. This triggers the `AttributeError` since the `decode` method cannot be called on a NoneType.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it.
2. If `value` is `None`, handle it appropriately based on the application's requirements, such as setting a default value or skipping the processing.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
In this corrected code, we added a check for `None` before attempting to decode the value. If the value is not `None`, then it will be decoded as before. If it is `None`, it will be handled appropriately based on the application's requirements.
