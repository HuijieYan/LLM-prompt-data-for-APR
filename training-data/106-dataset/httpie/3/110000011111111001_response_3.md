The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. It seems that the `Accept-Encoding` header has a value of `None`, which is causing the `AttributeError` when trying to decode it.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the header value is `None` before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the `if value is not None:` check before attempting to decode the header value, we ensure that we avoid the `AttributeError` caused by trying to decode a `None` value.
