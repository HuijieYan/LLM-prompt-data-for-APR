The provided code contains a function `update_headers` that is intended to update the session headers with the request headers while ignoring certain name prefixes. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` caused by trying to call the `decode` method on a `NoneType` object.

Based on the error message and the input parameter `request_headers`, it seems that the `Accept-Encoding` header has a value of `None`, which causes an issue when trying to decode `None` using the `decode` method.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `update_headers` function to handle the case where the header value is `None` before attempting to decode it and update the session headers.

Below is the corrected `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if the value is not None before decoding
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected function, we added a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If the value is not `None`, then we decode it using the `utf8` encoding. This modification will prevent the `AttributeError` caused by trying to call the `decode` method on a `NoneType` object for the `Accept-Encoding` header with a value of `None`.
