The issue is occurring in the `update_headers` function within the `sessions.py` file. The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode', which implies that the `value` variable in the function is set to None and an attempt is being made to call the `decode` method on it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `request_headers` dictionary contains a key with a value of `None`. When the loop iterates over the items in the `request_headers`, it encounters a key with a `None` value, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before applying the `decode` method on it. Additionally, we should also handle the case when the value is already a string, eliminating the need to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

With these changes, the function will first check if the `value` is not `None`, and then it will decode it only if it's a bytes object. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring in the future.
