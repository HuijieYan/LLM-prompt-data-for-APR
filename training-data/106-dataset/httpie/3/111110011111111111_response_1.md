The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error is caused by the `decode` method being called on a value that is `None`. This can be seen from the input parameter runtime value and type: request_headers, value: `{'User-Agent': b'HTTPie/1.0.0-dev', 'Accept-Encoding': None}`, type: `dict`. The `decode` method is applied to the `value` variable within the method, which causes an AttributeError when the value is `None`.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to check for `None` before attempting to decode the value. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If the value is `None`, it should be handled differently, possibly by converting it to a string or setting a default value.

The corrected code for the `update_headers` method is as follows:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
