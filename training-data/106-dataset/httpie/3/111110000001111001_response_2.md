Potential error location: The error is occurring within the for loop that iterates through the request_headers and updates the session headers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code attempts to decode the value of the headers, assuming it's in 'utf8', which may not always be the case.
2. In the for loop, there is no check for the case when the header name does not start with any ignored prefixes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the value can be decoded in 'utf8' before attempting to decode it.
2. Add a condition to update the session headers for headers that do not start with ignored prefixes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Union

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def update_headers(self, request_headers: dict):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict
        """

        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if value is bytes before decoding
                value = value.decode('utf8')

            ignore_header = False
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    ignore_header = True
                    break
            
            if not ignore_header:  # Update the session headers if not an ignored header
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
