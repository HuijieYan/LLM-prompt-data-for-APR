Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `self['headers'][name] = value`. It seems that `self` is meant to be a dictionary-like object, but it is being used incorrectly. 

Reason behind the bug:
The function is trying to update the headers of a session with the request headers, ignoring certain name prefixes. However, the way it's trying to access and update the header values seems incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `self` is meant to be a dictionary, then use `self` directly to update the headers.
2. If `self` is an object with a method to update the headers, then call that method to update the headers.
3. Ensure that the correct data structure and method are used to update the session headers with the request headers with the necessary conditions.

Corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            # Assuming self is a dictionary
            self[name] = value
```
