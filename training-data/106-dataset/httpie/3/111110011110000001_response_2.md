The error message indicates that the 'value' being passed to the decode function inside the update_headers method is of type 'NoneType', hence the 'AttributeError'.

1. The test case is trying to update headers in a session, which is calling the update_headers method. This is likely the origin of the error.

2. The potential error is in the line 'value = value.decode('utf8')' inside the for loop in the update_headers method.

3. The bug occurs because the code assumes that the 'value' variable will always have a valid value, but in this case, it seems that it can be None.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if the 'value' is None, and if it is, skip the decoding and continue to the next iteration of the loop.

5. Here's the corrected code for the update_headers method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Add this condition to check if value is None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the condition to check if 'value' is not None, we ensure that the decode('utf8') method is only called when 'value' is not None, thus preventing the 'NoneType' AttributeError.
