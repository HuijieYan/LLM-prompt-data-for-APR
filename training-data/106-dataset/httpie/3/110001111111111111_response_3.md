The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the Session class. The function attempts to call the `decode` method on the `value` of the request headers, assuming it to be a byte string. However, the `value` for the 'Accept-Encoding' header is `None`, which causes the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode' error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the value is `None` before attempting the `decode` operation. This can be achieved by checking if the value is not `None` before encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

With this corrected code, the function will first check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This will prevent the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode' error from occurring.
