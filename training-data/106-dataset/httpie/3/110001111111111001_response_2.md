The bug in the `update_headers` function is that it is trying to call the `decode` method on the header value without checking if the value is `None` or not. In the provided test case, `Accept-Encoding` header has a value of `None`, which causes the error when the `decode` method is called on it.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the value is not `None` before trying to decode it. We can also handle the case when the value is not of type bytes by converting it to string.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/httpie_3/httpie/sessions.py

# corrected function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check for `None` and handling the case when the value is not of type bytes, we can prevent the `AttributeError` mentioned in the error message.
