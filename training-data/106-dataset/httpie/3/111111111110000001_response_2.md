The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" indicates that the code is trying to call the `decode` method on a `None` object, which is not allowed.

The potential error location within the `update_headers` function is the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. This is where the code is trying to decode the value, but it mistakenly assumes that the value is always a bytes-like object. However, the error message suggests that in this particular case, `value` is `None`, which does not have a `decode` method.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `value` is `None` before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we check if `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If it is `None`, we skip the decoding step. This should fix the bug and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
