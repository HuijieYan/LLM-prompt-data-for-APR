The test case `test_download_in_session` is not directly related to the buggy function `update_headers`. The error occurs in the `update_headers` function, specifically on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute `decode`, which means the variable `value` is `None` at some point during the function's execution.

The bug occurs because the `Accept-Encoding` header has a `None` value, and the function tries to decode `None` using the `decode` method, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. We can also add a try-except block to handle any other potential exceptions during the decode operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            try:
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            except (AttributeError, UnicodeDecodeError):
                pass
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With these changes, the function will handle `None` values and other potential decoding errors gracefully.
