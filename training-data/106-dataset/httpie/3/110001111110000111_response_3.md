The error is occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `sessions.py` file. The error message indicates that the code is trying to call the `decode` method on a `NoneType` object, which is not possible.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `value` variable is being set to `None` at some point, and then the code is attempting to call the `decode` method on it.

To fix the bug, you can add a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before trying to call the `decode` method on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Add a check to ensure value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check for `value` not being `None`, we can avoid calling the `decode` method on a `NoneType` object.
