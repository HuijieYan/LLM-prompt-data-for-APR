Potential Error:
The error is likely occurring in the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` because the `decode` method is being used on a string value, which is not allowed. The `decode` method is used for byte strings, not regular strings.

Reason for the Bug:
The `decode` method is used incorrectly, causing an error in the function. The intention might have been to handle byte strings, but the input `value` is a regular string.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the value is already a byte string before decoding it.
2. If the intention is to handle byte strings, the input parameter `request_headers` should be modified to use byte strings instead of regular strings.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.
    
        :type request_headers: dict
    
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue
    
            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
In the corrected code, we first check if `value` is a byte string before decoding it. If it is a byte string, then we decode it using the `decode` method. This ensures that the function works correctly without causing any errors.
