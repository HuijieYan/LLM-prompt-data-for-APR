The error is occurring in the `update_headers` function of the `httpie/sessions.py` file. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being used in a context where a `decode` attribute is being accessed.

The reason for this bug is that the `value` variable is being set to the result of `value.decode('utf8')`, but `value` is sometimes `None`, which does not have a `decode` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `value is not None` before trying to decode it. If `value` is `None`, then we skip the decoding step and proceed with the rest of the logic.
