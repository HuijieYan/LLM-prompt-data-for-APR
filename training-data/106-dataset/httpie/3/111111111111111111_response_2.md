The error occurs in the `update_headers` function in the `sessions.py` file. It is trying to call the `decode` method on the `value`, which may be `None` in some cases as illustrated by the input parameter `request_headers` in the test case.

The bug is caused by trying to call the `decode` method on a variable that may be `None`. To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding the check `if value is not None` before calling `decode`, we ensure that we only call `decode` on non-None values, which should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
