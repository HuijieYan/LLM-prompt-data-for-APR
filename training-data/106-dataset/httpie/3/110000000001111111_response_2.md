The error is occurring at the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` inside the `update_headers` function. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` indicates that the `value` being passed to the `update_headers` function is of type `None`, which does not have a `decode` attribute.

The potential error location is when the `Accept-Encoding` header is being passed with a value of `None`. This is causing the error because the code tries to decode a `None` value, which is not possible.

To fix the bug, a check can be added to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If the value is `None`, it should be left as is and appended to the headers dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By adding a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before decoding it, we can prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
