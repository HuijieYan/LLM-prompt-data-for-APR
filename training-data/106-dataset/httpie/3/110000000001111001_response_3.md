The error in the given function is that it tries to decode the value using `decode('utf8')`, assuming it is of type bytes, without checking its type. This causes an error when the value is of type None.

To fix this, we need to check the type of the value before attempting to decode it. Additionally, the function tries to access `self['headers'][name]` instead of `self.headers[name]`, which seems to be an error as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf8') if value else ''
        
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self.headers[name] = value
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the value is of type bytes before decoding it. If it is not, we set the value to an empty string. Additionally, we access `self.headers[name]` instead of `self['headers'][name]`.
