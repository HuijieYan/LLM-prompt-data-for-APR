The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object does not have the `decode` attribute. This means that `value` is None in the `update_headers` function.

The potential error location within the function is the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`. This line assumes that the `value` is not None and tries to decode it using the `utf8` encoding.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `request_headers` dictionary may contain None values for certain keys, resulting in the `value` being None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `value` is not None before decoding it. We can also add a check to ensure that the `value` is a string before trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None and isinstance(value, str):
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `value` is not None and also added a check using `isinstance` to ensure that `value` is a string before updating the session headers.
