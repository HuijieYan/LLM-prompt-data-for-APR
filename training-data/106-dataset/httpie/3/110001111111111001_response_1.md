The test case seems to be related to the error message provided. The error message indicates an AttributeError on the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` inside the `update_headers` function. This suggests that the `value` variable is expected to be a bytes-like object (hence the attempt to decode it), but in the Buggy case 1, it is `None`.

The potential error location is within the loop where `request_headers` is processed. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the 'Accept-Encoding' header, which has a value of `None`. When the loop encounters this header, it attempts to decode the value, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the value is `None` before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring when `value` is `None`.
