The error "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'" is occurring in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. This error is happening because the `value` variable is None, and we are trying to call the `decode` method on a NoneType object.

The reason for this error is that the input `request_headers` may contain a key with a value of None. This happens when the header is not present in the request, and in Python, accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary returns None by default.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is None before attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
With this change, we ensure that we only attempt to decode the value if it is not None, which will prevent the AttributeError.
