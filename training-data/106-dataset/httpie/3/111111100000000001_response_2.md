Potential error location: The error occurs in the line "value = value.decode('utf8')" when trying to decode the header value, assuming it's encoded in UTF-8.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: It is assumed that all header values are encoded in UTF-8, which may not always be the case. This assumption leads to a decoding error when a non-UTF-8 encoded value is encountered.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Handle decoding errors gracefully, without assuming that all values are encoded in UTF-8. This can be done using exception handling to catch decoding errors and handle them appropriately.

```python
# corrected function
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        try:
            decoded_value = value.decode('utf-8')
        except UnicodeDecodeError:
            decoded_value = value  # if decoding fails, use the original value
            
        if name == 'User-Agent' and decoded_value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = decoded_value
