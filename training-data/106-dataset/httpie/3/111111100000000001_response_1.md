The potential error in the provided function is that it attempts to decode the 'value' using the `decode('utf8')` method, which is causing the issue. This is because the 'value' is already expected to be a string, and using the decode method on a string is not valid.

The reason for the bug is that the function attempts to decode a string using `decode('utf8')` when it is not necessary.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
