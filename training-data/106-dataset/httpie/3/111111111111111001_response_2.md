The error is occurring in the `update_headers` function of the `Session` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `decode` method being called on a `NoneType` object. The problematic line of code is: `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

The reason for the error is that `Accept-Encoding` header's value is `None`, and when the code tries to decode it using the `decode('utf8')` method, it results in the `NoneType` object not having the `decode` attribute.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case where the header's value is `None` by checking if the value is not `None` before decoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict
    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Add a check for None value
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
With this correction, the code will first check if the value is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring when the header's value is `None`.
