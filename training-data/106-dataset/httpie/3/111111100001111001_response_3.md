The error in the provided function is related to the attempt to decode the value in the request_headers dictionary. When the value is None, it cannot be decoded using the decode('utf8') method, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case where the value is None before attempting to decode it. We can also ensure that the decoded value does not lead to any errors or unexpected behavior when working with headers.

Here's the corrected code for the update_headers function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Add check for None value
            value = value.decode('utf-8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

With these changes, we ensure that the function handles the case where the value is None before attempting to decode it. This should prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the original function.
