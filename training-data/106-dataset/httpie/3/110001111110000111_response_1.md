Potential error location: The line `value = value.decode('utf8')` in the `update_headers` method is causing the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode' error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the `value` variable is being accessed as if it's always a string, but in some cases, it might be None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `value` is not None before trying to decode it.
2. Handle the case where `value` is None separately to avoid the AttributeError.

Updated/Crrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
