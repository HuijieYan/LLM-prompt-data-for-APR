The error message indicates that the code is trying to call the `decode` method on a variable that is of type `NoneType`. This means that the `value` variable in the `update_headers` method is `None`, and hence cannot be decoded.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the `value` in the request headers is always a string that can be decoded. However, the error message indicates otherwise.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. If the `value` is `None`, it should be handled in a way that does not cause the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `value` is not `None` before attempting to decode it. This prevents the AttributeError from being raised when `value` is `None`.
