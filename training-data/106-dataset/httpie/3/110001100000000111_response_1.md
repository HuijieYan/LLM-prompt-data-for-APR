Potential Error Location: 
The error is occurring within the update_headers function. Specifically, the line `value = value.decode('utf8')` is causing the AttributeError because the value being passed is of type None and does not have the decode method.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error occurs because the function is assuming that the values in the request_headers dictionary can be decoded using the 'utf8' codec. However, in the provided test case, one of the header values is None, leading to the AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the value is not None before attempting to decode it.
2. Handle the case where the value is None differently, for example by setting a default value.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if value is not None
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
