Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, which means that the `value` variable in the `update_headers` function is None.

Error Location:
The potential error location within the `update_headers` function is the line `value = value.decode('utf8')`.

Reason behind the Bug:
The `value` variable is being set to None, which indicates that the `request_headers` dictionary passed to the function contains a key-value pair with a None value. This is causing the `decode` method to be called on a NoneType object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the `request_headers` dictionary for None values before attempting to decode them.
2. Handle the case where the `value` is None and decide on the appropriate action, such as skipping that key-value pair or setting a default value.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:
            value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```
