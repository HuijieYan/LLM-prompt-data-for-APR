The error in the provided code is due to the `decode` method being called on the `value` variable without checking if it is of type `bytes`. In the given test case, the `value` for the `Accept-Encoding` header is `None`, which leads to the 'NoneType' error when trying to decode it.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is of type `bytes` before calling the `decode` method on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update_headers` method:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if value is of type bytes
            value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue
        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

This corrected code checks if the `value` is of type `bytes` before attempting to decode it, which should solve the 'NoneType' error issue.
