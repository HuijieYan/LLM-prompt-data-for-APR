The bug in the provided function is that it tries to decode the request header values from utf-8, assuming they are bytes, but this will cause an error if the values are already strings.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the value is of type bytes before trying to decode it. If it's already a string, we should leave it as is.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            value = value.decode('utf-8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```
