The error occurs in the `update_headers` method of the `Session` class. The error is caused by the `decode` method being called on the `value` variable, which is of type `None`, when it is not guaranteed to be a byte string that can be decoded.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `update_headers` method to handle the case where the `value` is `None` and prevent calling the `decode` method on it. We can also check if the value is a string before calling the `decode` method.

```python
class Session(BaseConfigDict):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def update_headers(self, request_headers):
        """
        Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
        certain name prefixes.

        :type request_headers: dict
        """
        for name, value in request_headers.items():
            if isinstance(value, bytes):
                value = value.decode('utf8')
            if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
                continue

            for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
                if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                    break
            else:
                self['headers'][name] = value
```

This corrected code checks if the `value` is a byte string before attempting to decode it. If the `value` is not of type `bytes`, it will not attempt to decode it and will use the original value instead. This fix should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
