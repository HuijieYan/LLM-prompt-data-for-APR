The error occurs because the `request_headers` dictionary contains a value of `None` for the key `'Accept-Encoding'`. In the buggy function `update_headers`, there is a line `value = value.decode('utf8')` which tries to decode the value assuming it's a bytes-like object, but in this case, `value` is `None`.

To fix this bug:
- Check if the `value` is not `None` before trying to decode it. If it is `None`, handle it accordingly.
- Additionally, to avoid re-encoding already decoded strings, check if the value is already a string before decoding it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update_headers(self, request_headers):
    """
    Update the session headers with the request ones while ignoring
    certain name prefixes.

    :type request_headers: dict

    """
    for name, value in request_headers.items():
        if value is not None:  # Check if the value is not None
            if isinstance(value, bytes):  # Check if the value is a bytes-like object
                value = value.decode('utf8')
        if name == 'User-Agent' and value.startswith('HTTPie/'):
            continue

        for prefix in SESSION_IGNORED_HEADER_PREFIXES:
            if name.lower().startswith(prefix.lower()):
                break
        else:
            self['headers'][name] = value
```

By making these changes, the function will handle `None` values properly and avoid attempting to decode values that are not byte-like objects.
