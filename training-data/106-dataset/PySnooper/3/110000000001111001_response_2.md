This buggy function is intended to return a function `write` based on the type of the `output` parameter. The bug seems to be in handling the `elif` condition where `output` is a string or PathLike object.

The reason for the bug is that in the `elif` condition, the code refers to `output_path` which is not defined anywhere in the function. It should be using the `output` variable instead.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code inside the `elif` condition to use the correct variable name `output` instead of `output_path`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from os import PathLike
from io import TextIOBase

# this is the corrected function
def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, TextIOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code:
- The import statements for the required types are added.
- The `output_path` variable is replaced with `output` inside the `elif` condition.
- The type hint for the `output` parameter is also added to improve readability and correctness.
