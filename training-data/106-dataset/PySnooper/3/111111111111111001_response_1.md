The error message indicates a "NameError" due to 'output_path' not being defined when attempting to open a file for writing.

1. The test_file_output function creates a temp folder and a file within it, and then attempts to use the pysnooper.snoop decorator to trace the my_function. The error occurs when my_function is being executed.

2. The potential error location is within the get_write_function function where the 'output_path' variable is intended to be used.

3. The error occurs because in the 'get_write_function' method, the variable 'output_path' is not defined. It should be 'output' instead, and it is inconsistent with the input parameter 'output'.

4. We should modify the 'get_write_function' method to use the 'output' parameter that is passed into the function instead of 'output_path'. This will ensure that the correct file path is used when writing to the file.

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'get_write_function' method:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
