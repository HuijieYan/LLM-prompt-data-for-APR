Potential error location: The error occurs in the function "get_write_function" where the output argument is checked for its type and different write functions are defined based on the type of the output.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when the output is None. It defines the write function for the case when output is None, but it doesn't return the defined write function in this case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to define the write function for the case when output is None and return the defined function.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
        return write
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
        return write
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)
        return write
```
