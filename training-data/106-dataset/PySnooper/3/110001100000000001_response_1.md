The potential error in the `get_write_function` is that the variable `output_path` is not defined and should be replaced with `output` in the case where `output` is a path-like object or a string.

Reason for the bug: 
- In the case where `output` is a path-like object or a string, the variable `output_path` is used instead, which is not defined.

Approach to fix the bug:
- Replace `output_path` with `output` in the case where `output` is a path-like object or a string.

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)
    
    return write
```
