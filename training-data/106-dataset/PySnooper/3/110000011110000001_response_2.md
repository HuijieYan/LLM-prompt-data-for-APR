The error message is indicating a `NameError` due to the variable `output_path` not being defined. This error is likely occurring in the `write` function within the `get_write_function` method.

The potential error location is in the section of code that handles the case when `output` is a string or `pycompat.PathLike`. The variable `output_path` is being used instead of `output` which is causing the `NameError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` is not defined, instead, it should use the input variable `output`.

To fix the bug, the `output_path` variable should be replaced with `output` in the section of code that handles the string or `pycompat.PathLike` case.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Replace output_path with output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

After fixing and using the corrected `get_write_function` method, the `NameError` will be resolved when `output_path` is replaced with `output`.
