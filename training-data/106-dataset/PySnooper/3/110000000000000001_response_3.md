Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the if-elif-else conditional statements where different function implementations are defined based on the type of the output.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the variable output_path is not defined anywhere in the code. Additionally, sys and pycompat are not imported in the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary modules (sys and pycompat)
2. Define the variable output_path appropriately within the conditional block
3. Ensure consistency in variable names (output, output_path, etc.)
4. Avoid using assert to handle different output types

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]):

    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
