The error "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" occurs because the variable 'output_path' is not defined anywhere in the function. Instead, the intention is to use the 'output' variable that is passed as an argument to the function.

To fix this bug, we need to replace 'output_path' with 'output' in the part of the code where the file is being opened for writing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from os import write as os_write


def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            os_write(stderr.fileno(), s.encode())
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                os_write(output_file.fileno(), s.encode())
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code:
- I replaced 'output_path' with 'output' in the elif block to correctly use the 'output' variable as the file path.
- I also imported the 'write' function from the 'os' module to allow writing to the standard error stream and file streams.
