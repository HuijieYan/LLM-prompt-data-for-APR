The error message indicates a `NameError` because the variable `output_path` is not defined. This error occurs in the section of the buggy function where the `output` is of type `str`. The `output_path` should be replaced with just `output` in the `write` function definition.

The reason behind the bug is that the variable `output_path` is referenced but not defined. This indicates that there is a typo or variable naming mistake in the code.

To fix the bug, the variable `output_path` needs to be replaced with just `output` in the `write` function definition, so that the appropriate file path is used when writing to the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

The correction involves replacing `output_path` with just `output` inside the `write` function when the output is of type `str`. This will ensure that the correct file path is used for writing to the file.
