Potential error location: The `output_path` variable is used instead of the `output` variable in the second if block.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The second if block uses an undefined variable `output_path` instead of the `output` variable.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Replace `output_path` with `output` in the second if block to correctly handle the output variable.
2. Add necessary imports for the modules used in the function (e.g., `sys`, `pycompat`, `utils`) if not already imported.

Corrected code:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
