The error message indicates that there is a "NameError" because the variable "output_path" is not defined. This issue is occurring in the write function due to the incorrect usage of variables.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the elif block where the output is a string or PathLike object. The incorrect variable "output_path" is being used instead of "output" when opening the file for writing.

The bug is occurring because the variable "output_path" is not defined anywhere in the function, and it should be using the "output" variable instead.

To fix the bug, the correct variable "output" should be used when opening the file for writing in the elif block.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union
from typing.io import TextIO

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIO]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIO)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, the variable "output_path" has been replaced with "output" to ensure correctness and resolve the "NameError" issue.
