Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the elif branch of the get_write_function, specifically in the part where it's trying to open the output_path file.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The variable output_path is not defined anywhere in the function or within the scope of the function. It seems like it should be using the variable output instead of output_path.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The code needs to be modified to use the correct variable name 'output' instead of 'output_path' when opening the file.

```python
import sys
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, 'utils.WritableStream']) -> 'write':
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)
    
    return write
```
