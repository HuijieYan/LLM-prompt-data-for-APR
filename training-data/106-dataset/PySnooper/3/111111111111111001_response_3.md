The error message indicates a NameError in the `write` function, specifically at the line `with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file`. This error occurs because the variable `output_path` is not defined in the `write` function.

The bug arises from a typo in the `get_write_function` code. In the `isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` condition, it should be using `output` instead of `output_path`.

To fix the bug, the `write` function should use the `output` variable instead of `output_path`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from collections.abc import Collection
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Collection, utils.WritableStream]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s: str) -> None:
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
