The bug in the provided function `get_write_function` is related to the usage of `output_path` variable. The error message "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" is indicating that the variable `output_path` is not defined in the function. 

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the variable `output_path` is not defined anywhere in the function, and it seems that it should be replaced with the `output` variable, which is the actual file path being passed to the function.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` in the section of code inside the `elif` block, where a file should be opened for writing.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):  # using Path from pathlib
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # replacing output_path with output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, we've replaced `output_path` with `output` inside the `elif` block, and also modified the import for the `PathLike` to use `Path` from the `pathlib` module. This should resolve the "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" issue.
