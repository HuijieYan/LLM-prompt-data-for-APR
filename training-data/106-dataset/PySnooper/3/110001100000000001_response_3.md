Potential error: The function get_write_function is meant to return the appropriate write function based on the type of output provided. However, it currently does not handle the case if the output is a file path or a string.

Reason for the bug: The code only checks for None and a WritableStream object, but does not handle the case for a file path or a string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the output is a file path or a string using isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)) and then define the write function accordingly.
2. If the output is a file path or a string, open the file and define the write function to write to the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]):

    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        output_path = Path(output)
        def write(s):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
