The potential error in the function is that the variables `output_path` and `utils` are not defined within the function. This will cause a NameError when trying to use them.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `output_path` variable and import the necessary modules (sys, pycompat, and utils) at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function`:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
import utils  # Assuming utils module is being used in the original code

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, `output_path` is replaced with `output` and the required modules are imported at the beginning of the function.
