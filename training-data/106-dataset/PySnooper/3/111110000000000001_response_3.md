Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the elif block where the variable output_path is used without being defined.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the variable output_path is not defined within the function, resulting in a NameError when the function is called with a string or PathLike object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the variable output_path within the elif block.
2. Use the correct variable name for the output path (output or output_path) consistently.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
