The error message "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" suggests that there is an issue with the variable name 'output_path'. Looking at the code, it seems that there is a typo in the code, and the correct variable name should be 'output' instead of 'output_path'.

Additionally, the function get_write_function is defining multiple inner functions with the same name 'write'. This will cause the last definition of 'write' to overwrite the previous ones, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the variable name to 'output' and also define the inner functions with unique names or use different approaches to handle the output types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write_to_stderr(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
        write = write_to_stderr
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write_to_file(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
        write = write_to_file
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write_to_stream(s):
            output.write(s)
        write = write_to_stream

    return write
```

In the corrected code:
- The variable name 'output_path' has been corrected to 'output'.
- Inner functions are defined with unique names that accurately describe their functionalities (write_to_stderr, write_to_file, write_to_stream).
- The correct inner function is assigned to the variable 'write' based on the type of the output.

This should resolve the NameError and improve the functionality of the get_write_function.
