The error message indicates a NameError in the `write` function, specifically that `output_path` is not defined. This error occurs within the `get_write_function` method when trying to open an output file.

The error occurs because `output_path` is not defined within the `write` function when `output` is of type `str` or `PathLike`. Instead, it should use the `output` variable directly to open the file.

To fix this bug, the `write` function needs to be defined within the `if` conditions rather than as separate functions. This will allow the `output` variable to be directly used for writing to the file without accessing a separate variable `output_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` method:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (str, Path)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
