The error message indicates a NameError, specifically stating "output_path" is not defined. This error is triggered in the write function when trying to open a file using "output_path" which is not defined anywhere in the function.

The issue lies in the get_write_function method where the output_path variable is not defined for the file output case.

To fix this issue, we need to replace "output_path" with "output" in the file output case within the get_write_function method.

Here's the corrected code for the get_write_function method:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pysnooper.third_party import pycompat, utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, pycompat.PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With this fix, the error related to the NameError should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
