Potential error location: Line 26 in the code, where there is an attempt to open a file using a variable named output_path, which is not defined anywhere in the code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to open a file using a variable that has not been defined, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. In the case where output is a file path or a PathLike object, the correct variable to use for opening the file is 'output' instead of 'output_path'.
2. Additionally, it seems that the variable output_path should be replaced with output in the open() function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

class WritableStream:
    def write(self, s: str):
        pass

PathLike = Union[str, Path]

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
