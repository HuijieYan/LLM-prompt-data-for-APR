The problem in the given code is that the variable `output_path` is not defined, and it should be replaced with `output` instead.

The buggy function is attempting to define different `write` functions based on the type of `output`. However, there are a few issues with the provided implementation:
1. The variable `output_path` is used instead of `output` inside the function for handling strings or `pycompat.PathLike`.
2. The condition `isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` checks for `output` type, but `output_path` is used inside the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `write` functions inside the `get_write_function` based on the condition and remove the usage of the undefined variable `output_path`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code:
- The variable `output` is used instead of `output_path`.
- `pycompat.PathLike` is replaced with `Path` for type checking.
- The corrected code should now work as intended without raising a `NameError` related to the undefined variable `output_path`.
