Potential error location: The `output_path` variable is used without being defined in the second `if` condition.

Reason behind the bug: In the second `if` condition, `output_path` is used without being defined, which will cause a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use the `output` variable instead of `output_path` in the second `if` condition.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
