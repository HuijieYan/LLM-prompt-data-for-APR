Potential error location: The issue lies in the elif condition where the variable `output_path` is used instead of `output` to open the file for writing.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `output_path` variable is not defined anywhere in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use the `output` variable instead of `output_path` in the elif condition to open the file for writing.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from typing import Union
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, pycompat.PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
