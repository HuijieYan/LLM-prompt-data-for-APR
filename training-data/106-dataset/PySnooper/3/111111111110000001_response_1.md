Potential error location: The `output_path` is not defined within the `write` function, causing a NameError when attempting to access it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `output_path` variable is not defined within the `write` function when the `output` argument is a file path.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass the `output_path` as an argument to the `write` function.
2. Define the `output_path` variable within the `write` function to refer to the file path.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s, output_path=output):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
