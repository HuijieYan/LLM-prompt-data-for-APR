The error message indicates a `NameError` caused by the variable `output_path` not being defined within the `write` function. This points to the potential error location in the `get_write_function` where the `output` variable is not used to define `output_path`.

The buggy function does not properly handle the output argument. It only creates the `write` function but does not set the necessary variable for writing into a file. This results in a `NameError` when trying to log the output.

To fix this issue, the `get_write_function` should define `output_path` according to the type of `output` provided. If `output` is a string, it should be used as the `output_path`. Therefore, the corrected code is as follows:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import pysnooper
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
            return stderr
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
