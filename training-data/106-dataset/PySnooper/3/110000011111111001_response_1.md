The error message points to a `NameError` where `output_path` is not defined within the `write` function. This issue is in the `get_write_function` regarding the `output_path` variable and the conditional statements.

The code does not define `output_path` anywhere, and it also incorrectly references `output_path` instead of `output` in the second conditional block. Additionally, `sys.stderr` and `pycompat.PathLike` are not imported, causing errors in these conditions.

To fix this issue, the `output_path` needs to be replaced with `output`. The `sys` and `pycompat` needs to be imported to use `sys.stderr` and `pycompat.PathLike`.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import IO, Union, BinaryIO

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, IO, BinaryIO]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, IO)  # Use Union[IO, BinaryIO] for Python 3.6 and later
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
