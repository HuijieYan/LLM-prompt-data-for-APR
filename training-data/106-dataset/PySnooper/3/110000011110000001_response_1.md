The error message indicates that there is a NameError because 'output_path' is not defined. This implies that there is an issue with the variable name used in the write function, which is not defined within the function. 

The potential error location within the function is in the elif block of the get_write_function. The variable name used in the file handling operation should be consistent with the variable being passed to the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable name used in the file handling operation is not consistent. The correct variable name should be 'output' instead of 'output_path'.

To fix the bug, the write function should be modified to use the variable 'output' consistently. Additionally, the missing import statements for sys, pycompat, and utils should be added.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import sys
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
