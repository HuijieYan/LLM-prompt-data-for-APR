The potential error in the code is with the `output_path` variable, which is not defined anywhere in the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable `output_path` should be used instead of `output` in the second `if` statement. This is likely a typo.

To fix the bug, we can replace `output` with `output_path` in the second `if` statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
