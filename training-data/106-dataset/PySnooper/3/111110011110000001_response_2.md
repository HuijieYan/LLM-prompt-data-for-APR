The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined within the function `get_write_function`. This is likely the cause of the bug.

The reason for the error is that the variable `output_path` is used in the function, but it is not defined. It seems like it should be `output` instead of `output_path`.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` in the `get_write_function` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union
from io import TextIOBase

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, TextIOBase]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIOBase)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
