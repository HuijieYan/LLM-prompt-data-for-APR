The error is occurring due to the variable `output_path` not being defined in the function. Instead, the intention was to use the `output` variable as the file path when opening a file for writing.

To fix this issue, we need to update the code to use the `output` variable instead of `output_path` when opening the file.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import pysnooper.pycompat as pycompat
import pysnooper.utils as utils

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Updated to use 'output' instead of 'output_path'
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
