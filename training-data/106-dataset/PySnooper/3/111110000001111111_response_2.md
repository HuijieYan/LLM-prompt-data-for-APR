The error is occurring in the elif block of the get_write_function where the variable 'output_path' is being used instead of 'output'. This is causing the NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined.

To fix this bug, the code inside the elif block should be updated to use the variable 'output' instead of 'output_path'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union, TextIO
from os import PathLike

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, TextIO]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, TextIO)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
