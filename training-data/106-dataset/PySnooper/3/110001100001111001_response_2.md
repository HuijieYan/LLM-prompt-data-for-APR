Potential error location: The issue lies in the `get_write_function` where the function is not returning the correct `write` function based on the type of `output`.

Reason for the bug: The `get_write_function` defines three different `write` functions based on the type of `output`, but it does not return the correct `write` function based on the input `output`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check the type of `output` and return the appropriate `write` function.
- Use `output` for file path when the type is `str` and create a file if it doesn't exist.
- Use `sys.stderr` when `output` is `None`.
- Otherwise, assuming `output` is a writable stream, use the `output` object for writing.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
import os

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, str):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert hasattr(output, 'write')
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)
    
    return write
```
