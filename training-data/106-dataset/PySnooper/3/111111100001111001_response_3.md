The buggy function `get_write_function` is intended to return a specific `write` function based on the type of the `output` parameter. However, the function is currently not implemented correctly and does not handle the different cases as intended.

The problem lies in the implementation of the `get_write_function` function. The conditional checks for the type of the `output` parameter are not properly implemented. Additionally, the variable `output_path` is used in the `elif` block without being defined.

To fix the bug, we need to properly define the `write` functions for each case and handle the `output_path` variable in the elif block. We also need to import the necessary modules such as `sys` and `pycompat` for the code to work.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function` function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
            
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
                
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With these changes, the `get_write_function` function should now correctly return the appropriate `write` function based on the type of the `output` parameter.
