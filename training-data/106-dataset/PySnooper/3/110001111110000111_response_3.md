The error "NameError: name 'output_path' is not defined" occurs because the variable "output_path" is not defined in the get_write_function. The code is trying to open a file using "output_path" but this variable is not defined at all within the function.

To fix this bug, we need to replace "output_path" with the input parameter "output" since this is the actual variable representing the file path that we want to open. The correct code should use "output" instead of "output_path" when opening the file.

Here is the corrected code for the get_write_function:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
