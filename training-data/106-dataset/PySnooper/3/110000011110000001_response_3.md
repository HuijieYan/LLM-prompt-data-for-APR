The error message indicates that there is an issue with the variable `output_path` not being defined. This means that there is a variable being used without being defined, causing the NameError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `elif` block where `output` is an instance of `pycompat.PathLike` or `str`. The variable `output_path` is not defined, which leads to the NameError.

The reason behind this bug is that the variable `output_path` is being used but it is not defined within the `write` function.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `output_path` variable based on the `output` parameter, which is either a string or a PathLike object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function code
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union
import pycompat
import utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, pycompat.PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream, Path]):

    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, I have replaced `output_path` with `output` inside the `elif` block to fix the NameError. I have also added necessary imports and type hints for the function parameter.
