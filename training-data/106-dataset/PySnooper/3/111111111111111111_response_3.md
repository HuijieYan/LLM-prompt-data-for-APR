The error message indicates a NameError related to the variable 'output_path', which is not defined in the function. This aligns with the provided function 'get_write_function()' where different functions are defined based on the type of 'output'. 

The issue is in the conditional block where 'output' is of type str. In this block, the variable 'output_path' is used instead of 'output' in the 'write' function definition.

To fix this issue:
1. Change the variable 'output_path' to 'output' within the conditional block for handling str type.
2. Remove the unused imports and function signatures.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_write_function' function:

```python
import sys
from os import PathLike
from typing import Union
import pysnooper
from pysnooper import pycompat, utils

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, PathLike, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
