The error message "NameError: name 'output_path' is not defined" suggests that the variable 'output_path' is not defined in the function. This is likely the cause of the issue.

To fix this bug, the function 'get_write_function' should be modified to use the correct variable name that is passed as the 'output' parameter.

Below is the corrected code for the 'get_write_function' function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In this corrected code:
- The import statement for 'Path' is added to handle path-like objects.
- The variable name 'output_path' is changed to 'output' within the 'write' function to match the parameter name.
- The correct type 'Path' is used instead of 'pycompat.PathLike' for the isinstance check.

These changes should fix the NameError issue and allow the function to work as expected.
