The error message indicates that the name 'output_path' is not defined, which suggests that there is a problem with the variable name within the write function. 

Looking at the original function 'get_write_function', the issue seems to be within the branch that checks if the output is a path or string. In this branch, the variable 'output_path' is used instead of 'output'. This leads to the NameError when the function is called with a file output path.

To fix this issue, we can replace 'output_path' with 'output' within the branch that handles file output.

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import pysnooper
from typing import Union
# this is the corrected function
def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, Path, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
