The error is occurring because the `output_path` variable is not defined within the function. This is due to an incorrect variable name used when checking the type of `output`. The corrected variable name should be `output` instead of `output_path`.

Here's the modified and corrected function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
