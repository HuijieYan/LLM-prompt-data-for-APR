The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect use of the variable `output_path` in the `elif` block. The variable `output_path` has not been defined in the function, and it should be using the `output` variable instead.

The buggy function is checking the type of `output` in the `elif` block, but it's not using the `output` variable correctly to open the file. Instead, it's using an undefined variable `output_path`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `output_path` with `output` in the `elif` block.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import sys
from typing import Union
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code:
- We've replaced `output_path` with `output` in the `elif` block to open the file correctly.
- We've also added type hints to the function parameters to make the input types clear.
