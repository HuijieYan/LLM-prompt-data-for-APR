The error message indicates a NameError because the variable `output_path` is not defined in the function. This suggests that the variable should be `output` instead of `output_path`.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the section of the `get_write_function` where the `output_path` variable is used to reference the `output` variable instead.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[str, Path]):

    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

The correction involves changing `output_path` to `output` so that the correct variable is being referenced in the functions created within `get_write_function`.
