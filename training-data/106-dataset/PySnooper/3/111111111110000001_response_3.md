1. The test case is attempting to call the `my_function` while using the `@pysnooper.snoop(str(path))` decorator, which is expected to use the `get_write_function(output)` function to define a custom write function for logging. The error message indicates that the variable `output_path` is not defined when attempting to open a file in the custom write function.

2. The potential error location is within the `get_write_function(output)` function, specifically in the `elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` condition where the custom write function is defined to write to a file using the `output_path` variable, which is not defined anywhere within this function.

3. The bug occurred because the `output_path` variable is not defined anywhere within the `elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` condition. This causes a `NameError` when trying to use `output_path` in the `write` function defined within that condition, as seen in the error message.

4. To fix the bug, it would be necessary to define the `output_path` variable within the `elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str))` condition or choose a different variable name for the file path. Also, it's important to ensure that the correct file path is used within the `write` function to avoid potential issues related to reading or writing to files.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_write_function(output)` function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):
        output_path = Path(output)
        def write(s):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

In the corrected code, the `output_path` variable is properly defined within the `elif` condition, and it is used within the `write` function to open the file for writing. This should resolve the `NameError` issue and ensure that the file path is correctly utilized within the custom write function.
