The error message indicates that the variable "output_path" is not defined, which is causing a NameError when the function "write" is invoked. This error occurs when the "output" in the "get_write_function" function is of type str or pycompat.PathLike.

The problem lies in the following code:
```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output_path, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

The issue is that in the elif block, the variable "output_path" is not defined. It should be replaced with "output" since this block is dealing with the file path provided as the output.

To fix this, the corrected code for the "get_write_function" function should be:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
