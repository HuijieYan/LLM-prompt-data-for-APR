The error occurs due to the use of an undefined variable 'output_path' within the write function. This variable should be replaced by 'output' as 'output' contains the path to the file that needs to be written to.

To fix this bug, the write function needs to reference the 'output' variable instead of 'output_path'. It should also be modified so that it properly accepts the 'output' parameter and opens the file for writing based on its type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from collections.abc import Iterable


def get_write_function(output):
    def write(s):
        if output is None:
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
        elif isinstance(output, str) or isinstance(output, Path):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
        elif isinstance(output, Iterable):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
In this correction, the function `get_write_function` now correctly references the 'output' parameter and opens the file for writing based on its type. The 'isinstance' function is used to check if the 'output' variable is a string, a Path, or an Iterable, and the corresponding 'write' operations are performed accordingly.
