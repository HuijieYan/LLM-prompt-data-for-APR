The error message indicates that the variable 'output_path' is not defined. This is because the variables are defined as 'output' in the 'get_write_function', but the code tries to use 'output_path' in the write function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the 'write' functions inside the 'get_write_function' to use the correct variable name, which should be 'output'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_write_function':

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
