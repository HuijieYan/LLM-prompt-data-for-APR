The error in the given function `get_write_function` is that the variable `output_path` is used instead of the input parameter `output` in the condition block for the `str` type. This leads to a NameError as `output_path` is not defined in the function.

To fix this issue, we need to use the correct variable `output` instead of `output_path` in the condition block for the `str` type.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

def get_write_function(output: Union[None, str, utils.WritableStream]) -> callable:
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (Path, str)):  # using Path from pathlib instead of pycompat.PathLike
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # using the correct variable output instead of output_path
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```

With this corrected code, the issue of using the undefined variable `output_path` is resolved. The function now properly handles the different types of `output` and returns the `write` function accordingly.
