The error "NameError: global name 'output_path' is not defined" suggests that there is a variable called `output_path` which is not defined. Looking at the code, it seems that the intention was to use the `output` variable instead of `output_path`.

It is likely that the bug is in the block of code where the output is a string or a PathLike object. The variable `output_path` is not defined in the code, and it is likely a typo, as the intent is to use the `output` variable instead.

To fix this bug:
- Update the variable name `output_path` to `output` within the block of code where the output is a string or a PathLike object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_write_function(output):
    if output is None:
        def write(s):
            stderr = sys.stderr
            stderr.write(s)
    elif isinstance(output, (pycompat.PathLike, str)):
        def write(s):
            with open(output, 'a') as output_file:  # Change output_path to output
                output_file.write(s)
    else:
        assert isinstance(output, utils.WritableStream)
        def write(s):
            output.write(s)

    return write
```
