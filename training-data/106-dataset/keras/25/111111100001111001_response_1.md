The bug seems to be related to the incorrect computation of pixel values for different modes and data formats within the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`.

The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrectly modifying the input array 'x' for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes. The code for these modes is missing and should be added to correctly pre-process the input array.

To fix the bug, we need to add computation steps for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes. Additionally, we should consider adding validations for the input parameters to handle the 'tf' and 'torch' modes correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= mean
            x /= std
        else:
            x -= mean[::-1]
            x /= std[::-1]
        return x
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...] if x.ndim == 4 else x[:, ::-1]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    x -= mean
    return x
```

With this corrected code, the function now correctly preprocesses the input array for the different modes supported, including 'tf' and 'torch'. Additionally, it handles the different data formats and dimensions properly.
