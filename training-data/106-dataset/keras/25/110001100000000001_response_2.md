Potential error location: The bug occurs in the 'tf' mode where it scales the pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise. The bug is present in the line where x /= 127.5 and x -= 1, as it should be x *= 127.5 and x -= 1.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurred because the incorrect operation was performed on the input 'x' in the 'tf' mode.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by replacing the lines x /= 127.5 and x -= 1 with x *= 127.5 and x -= 1, respectively, to correctly scale the pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise.

Corrected code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
