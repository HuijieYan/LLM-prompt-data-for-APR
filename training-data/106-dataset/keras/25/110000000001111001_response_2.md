The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it doesn't account for the 'caffe' mode when the data format is 'channels_last'. The logic to convert the color channels from 'RGB' to 'BGR' uses the `data_format` variable, and this logic is incorrect. The function should check for the mode and update the input array accordingly.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic to correctly preprocess the input array based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 123.68
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 103.939
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 123.68
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 103.939
        return x
```
This updated code correctly handles the 'caffe' mode for both 'channel_first' and 'channel_last' data formats.
