The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data type conversion. The error occurs at the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, where it is trying to subtract a float value from an array of type int32.

The bug occurs because the `else` part of the code block doesn't have a return statement. This results in the function falling through to the code block that performs mean subtraction when it should not.

To fix this bug, we need to add a return statement for the `else` part of the code block that sets the `mean` and `std` values. This ensures that the function returns the preprocessed Numpy array after setting the mean and std values.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
