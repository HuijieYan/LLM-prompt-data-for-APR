There seems to be an issue with the normalization step for the mean and std values for the 'caffe' mode. The code is directly modifying the input array 'x' in-place, which can cause issues if it is meant to be used for further processing. It is also not handling the case when the data_format is 'channels_first' correctly.

To address the issue:
1. Instead of modifying the input array 'x' directly, the function can create a new array for preprocessed data and return it, leaving the input 'x' unchanged.
2. The function needs to handle the 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data format for both 3D and 4D input arrays.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        img = np.moveaxis(x, 3, 1)  # Change from 'channels_last' to 'channels_first'
    else:
        img = x
    
    if mode == 'caffe':
        # RGB to BGR
        img = img[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    
    elif mode == 'tf':
        img /= 127.5
        img -= 1.
        return img

    elif mode == 'torch':
        img /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    img -= mean

    if mode == 'tf':
        std = None
    else:
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        img /= std

    return img
