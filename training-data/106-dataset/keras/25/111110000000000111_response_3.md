Potential error location: The error may occur in the calculations related to the 'tf' and 'torch' modes, as well as in the zero-centering and scaling operations based on the data format.

Reasons for the bug: 
1. The 'tf' mode should scale the pixels between -1 and 1, but the current implementation is dividing by 127.5 and subtracting 1, which is incorrect.
2. The 'torch' mode should scale pixels between 0 and 1, and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset, which is not fully implemented in the current code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. For the 'tf' mode, the correct calculation to scale pixels between -1 and 1 is to divide by 127.5 and then subtract 1.
2. For the 'torch' mode, besides scaling the pixels between 0 and 1, each channel should be normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Corrected code:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            x[0] /= std[0]
            x[1] /= std[1]
            x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0] -= 103.939
        x[:, 1] -= 116.779
        x[:, 2] -= 123.68
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68
    return x
