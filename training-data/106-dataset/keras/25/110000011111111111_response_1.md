The error occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when trying to subtract the mean value from the input array `x`. The error message indicates that it's not possible to cast the output from `float64` to `int32`.

The bug is caused by the fact that when the `mode` is 'torch' or the `data_format` is 'channels_last', the mean subtraction operation is performed on the entire array `x`, which can contain integer values if the input is of type `ndarray` with `dtype=int32`.

To fix this, we should ensure that the mean subtraction operation is performed after converting the data type of `x` to `float64` or any suitable floating-point type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype(np.float64) / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    if mode == 'torch':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= np.reshape(mean, (3, 1, 1))
            if std is not None:
                x /= np.reshape(std, (3, 1, 1))
        else:
            x -= mean
            if std is not None:
                x /= std

    return x
```
