The error is occurring because the function is erroneously trying to perform operations that result in casting between float and int32 data types, which is not allowed.

The function is trying to modify the input `x` based on the values of `mode` and `data_format` variables, which results in illegal operations being performed when `mode` is `'caffe'`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operations are compatible with the data type of the input array `x`. Specifically, when the data type of `x` is int32, we should avoid operations that result in casting to float64.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = np.array(x[::-1, ...], dtype='float32')  # Convert to float before operations
            else:
                x = np.array(x[:, ::-1, ...], dtype='float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        else:
            x = np.array(x[..., ::-1], dtype='float32')  # Convert to float before operations
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected code:
- I added code to convert `x` to float32 before performing arithmetic operations, ensuring that we avoid illegal casting.
- I also used NumPy's array creation with explicit data type conversion to ensure that the resultant array is of type float32.

This should fix the bug by preventing any illegal casting operations.
