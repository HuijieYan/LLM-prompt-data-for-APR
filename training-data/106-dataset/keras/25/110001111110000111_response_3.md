The error message indicates that the code is attempting to subtract a float value from an integer array, which raises a 'UFuncTypeError'. This suggests that the error is related to the data type of the input array 'x' and the calculation being performed within the function.

The issue is occurring in the 'tf' mode for which 'x' is being divided by 127.5, causing it to become a float array. When the function then attempts to subtract 1 from the float array, it is unable to cast the result back to the original data type, which is 'int32' in this case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to ensure that the data type consistency is maintained throughout the calculations for different modes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
