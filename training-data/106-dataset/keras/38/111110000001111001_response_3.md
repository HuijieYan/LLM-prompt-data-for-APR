The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly updates the input_shape for each cell in the self.cells list. It also sets self.built to True at the end of the function, which is incorrect because the build function should only construct the cell and update its states, it should not mark the StackedRNNCells as built.

The input_shape should be updated to reflect the changes in the output dimension of the cells, so that the next cell in the sequence can use the correct input_shape.

To fix this, the input_shape should be updated based on the output_dim of the current cell in each iteration. Additionally, the self.built flag should not be set within the build function.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    # self.built = True  # removed this line
```

After fixing the function as shown above, it will correctly update the input_shape for each cell in the list and not set self.built prematurely.
