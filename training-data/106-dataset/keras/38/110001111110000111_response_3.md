The error message indicates that the 'build' function in the 'MinimalRNNCell' class is encountering an assertion error. The assertion is checking if the length of the 'input_shape' is equal to 2. However, the length is 3, causing the assertion error.

This error occurs because the 'input_shape' parameter is being modified in the 'build' function of the 'recurrent.py' file, specifically in the 'build' method of the RNN cell. This modification of the 'input_shape' causes the length of 'input_shape' to be different from what is expected in the 'MinimalRNNCell' class.

To fix this bug, the 'input_shape' modification inside the 'build' method of the RNN cell should be revised so that it does not affect the 'input_shape' used in the 'MinimalRNNCell' class. 

Here's the corrected code for the 'build' function in the 'recurrent.py' file:

```python
# this is the corrected build function
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    # Do not modify the input_shape here
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, the 'input_shape' is used in the loop to calculate the 'output_dim' but is not modified at the end of the loop. This change ensures that the 'input_shape' used in the 'MinimalRNNCell' class is not affected.

By making this change, the error encountered in the test case should be resolved.
