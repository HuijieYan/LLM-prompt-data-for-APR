The error occurs when the test function `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` is executed. The error is caused by an assertion within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The assertion checks whether the length of the input shape is equal to 2, and it fails.

The buggy function `build` takes `input_shape` and iterates through the cells. However, it fails to properly handle the cell state size and modify the `input_shape` accordingly.

To fix this bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Obtain the output dimension `output_dim` from the cell's state size correctly for each cell.
2. Modify the `input_shape` based on the obtained `output_dim`.
3. Set `self.built` to `True` after the loop.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

By ensuring that `output_dim` is computed correctly and updating the `input_shape` accordingly, the function should work as expected and the error in the test case should be resolved.
