Potential error location:
The issue is likely with the if statement checking if cell.state_size has a length.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the if statement checking isinstance(cell, Layer) and the if statement checking if cell.state_size has a length are not properly nested. This causes the code to incorrectly update the input_shape.

Possible approach to fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly nest the if statements so that the input_shape is updated only if cell is an instance of Layer and has a state_size with a length. We also need to handle the case where cell.state_size does not have a length.

Corrected code:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
