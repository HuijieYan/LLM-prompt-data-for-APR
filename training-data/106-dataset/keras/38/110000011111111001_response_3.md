The problematic function is `build` inside the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The error message indicates that the input shape has a length of 3 instead of 2, causing an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `input_shape` is being modified inside the loop, leading to inconsistency in the input shape at each iteration.

To fix the bug, the `input_shape` should be a local variable that is not modified during the loop. Additionally, the logic for updating `input_shape` based on the `cell.state_size` needs to be refactored.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    updated_input_shape = input_shape  # Use a separate variable to store the input_shape
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(updated_input_shape)  # Use the separate variable here
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        updated_input_shape = (updated_input_shape[0], updated_input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

With this change, the input shape is not modified during the loop, resolving the assertion error.
