The potential error in the provided function is in the line `if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):`, as it assumes that `cell` has a property called `state_size` which might not always be the case and could result in an AttributeError.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where `cell` does not have a `state_size` property.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `cell` has the `state_size` property before accessing it. Additionally, we should handle the case where `state_size` is a list and extract the first element if it is a list.

Corrected code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):  # Check if cell has the state_size attribute
            if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
