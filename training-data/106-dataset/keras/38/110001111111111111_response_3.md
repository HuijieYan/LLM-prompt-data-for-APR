The error occurs at the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` within the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class. The function `build` is expecting `input_shape` to have a length of 2, but in the failing case, it has a length of 3 (`(None, 5, 8)`).

The `input_shape` is being updated incorrectly within the `build` function of the StackRNNCells class. The current implementation of the build function is going through each cell in the list `self.cells`, updating `input_shape` based on the `state_size` of each cell. This process is causing the input shape to have an extra dimension ('None') along with the expected dimensions. The issue lies in the line `input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)`, which is updating the shape incorrectly.

To fix the issue, we need to remove the update to the input_shape inside the for loop and ensure that it maintains the expected shape. Then, mark `self.built` as True. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
    self.built = True
```

By retaining the original input_shape and setting `self.built` to True, we ensure that the build function works correctly and the input shape is not modified in an incorrect manner.
