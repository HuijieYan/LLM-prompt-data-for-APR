The issue with the provided function is that it does not handle the case where `cell.state_size` does not have the attribute `__len__`. 

To fix this issue, we can update the function to check whether `cell.state_size` has the attribute `__len__`. If it does, we can get the `output_dim` as `cell.state_size[0]`, otherwise, we can set `output_dim` directly to `cell.state_size`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        output_dim = cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__') else cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```

This updated code includes a conditional check to determine the `output_dim` based on whether `cell.state_size` has the attribute `__len__`, addressing the issue with the original function.
