The error occurs when the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class is executed in the `test_minimal_rnn_cell_layer` function. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error because the length of `input_shape` is not equal to 2.

The reason for this error is that the `input_shape` variable being passed to the `build` method is actually a 3D shape `(None, 5, 8)`, where `None` indicates the batch size, 5 indicates the time steps, and 8 indicates the input dimension.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic in the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class to handle the 3D input shape properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `MinimalRNNCell` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    # no time axis in the input shape passed to RNN cells
    assert len(input_shape) == 3

    self.input_dim = input_shape[-1]

    self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.input_dim, self.units),
                                  initializer='uniform',
                                  name='kernel')
    self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
        shape=(self.units, self.units),
        initializer='uniform',
        name='recurrent_kernel')
    self.built = True
```

In this corrected code, we correctly handle the 3D input shape passed to the RNN cell. We use `input_shape[-1]` to get the input dimension and then initialize the weights accordingly.

This correction should resolve the assertion error and ensure that the `MinimalRNNCell` class is built correctly.
