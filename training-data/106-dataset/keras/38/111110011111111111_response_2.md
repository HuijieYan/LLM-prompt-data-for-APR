The `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class is the source of the bug. The error message indicates that the input shape passed to the RNN cells is incorrect, causing an `AssertionError`.

The bug occurs because the for loop in the `build` method iterates over each cell in `self.cells` and tries to build the cell using the `input_shape`. However, the `input_shape` is modified inside the loop and used in subsequent iterations. This causes the input shape to be incorrect for the subsequent cells.

To fix the bug, a new variable should be used to store the modified input shape for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the `output_dim` should be updated for each cell based on its `state_size` before modifying the `input_shape`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], cell.state_size)  # Update input_shape based on cell.state_size
    self.built = True
```

With this correction, the `input_shape` is only modified for the current cell in each iteration, and the `state_size` is used to update the `output_dim` accordingly. This should resolve the `AssertionError` and ensure that the RNN cells are built with the correct input shape.
