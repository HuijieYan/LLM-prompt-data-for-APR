The bug is occurring in the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. The function tries to reshape the input shape based on the state size of the cells, resulting in an incorrect assertion in the test case due to the altered input shape.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the input shape when iterating through the cells and modifying the input shape based on the state size. This causes the assertion `assert len(input_shape) == 2` to fail in the test case since the input shape has been modified.

To fix this bug, the input shape should not be modified within the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class. Modifying the input shape based on the state size of the cells could lead to unexpected behavior and make it challenging to ensure consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `build` method of the `StackedRNNCells` class:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
    self.built = True
```

By removing the modification of the input shape, the function focuses solely on building each cell and sets the `built` attribute to `True` once the process is completed. This approach ensures that the `build` method is free from unnecessary logic that could lead to unintended consequences.
