The issue is present in the `build` function of the class `StackedRNNCells`. The bug is caused by incorrect logic when updating the `input_shape` variable. The code is trying to update the input shape based on the state size of each cell, but it does not handle the state size correctly and may lead to incorrect input shape calculation.

To fix the bug, the `build` function should be updated as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], cell.units)  # Update the input shape based on the units of the cell
    self.built = True
```

By using the `cell.units` attribute, we can ensure that the input shape is correctly updated based on the unit size of each cell. This aligns with the logic of stacked RNN cells and ensures that the input shape is updated appropriately.
