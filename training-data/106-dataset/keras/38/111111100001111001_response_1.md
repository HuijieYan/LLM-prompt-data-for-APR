The issue in the provided code is that the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class is defined multiple times with the same signature. This is not allowed in Python. Additionally, the logic within the `build` method seems to have been duplicated multiple times instead of being defined as a loop or a separate function.

The bug occurs because the `build` method is defined multiple times with the same signature, and the logic within it is not correctly handling the state size and the `self.built` flag.

To fix the bug, the `build` method should be defined only once with the correct logic to handle the state size and update the `self.built` flag.

The corrected code for the `build` method in the `StackedRNNCells` class is as follows:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
