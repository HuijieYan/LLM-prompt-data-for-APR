The potential error in the given code is that the `build` method is being defined multiple times with the same signature. This will cause a syntax error in Python, as a method can only be defined once within a class with the same name and signature.

The bug in the provided `build` method is that it is not handling the `cell.state_size` attribute properly. It checks if `cell.state_size` has a length attribute and if not, assigns `output_dim` to `cell.state_size`. This approach may not work as intended and could lead to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we should explicitly check if `cell.state_size` is an instance of `int` or not, and assign `output_dim` accordingly. Additionally, the repeated definition of the `build` method should be removed to avoid a syntax error.

Below is the corrected code for the `build` method:

```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size'):
            if isinstance(cell.state_size, int):
                output_dim = cell.state_size
            else:
                output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
            input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
