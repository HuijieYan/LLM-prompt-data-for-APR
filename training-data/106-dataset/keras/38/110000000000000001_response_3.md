Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the if statement that checks if the attribute cell.state_size has a length. If it does, then it sets the output_dim to the first element in state_size. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when cell.state_size is not an iterable object. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access the first element of cell.state_size.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to first check if cell.state_size is iterable before trying to access its first element.

Corrected Code:
```python
def build(self, input_shape):
    for cell in self.cells:
        if isinstance(cell, Layer):
            cell.build(input_shape)
        
        if hasattr(cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = cell.state_size
        input_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    self.built = True
```
