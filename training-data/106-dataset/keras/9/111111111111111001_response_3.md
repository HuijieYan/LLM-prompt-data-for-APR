The error occurs in the `process_list_block` function. The bug stems from the incorrect manipulation of the `ending_point` variable, causing the final block to be one character shorter than intended.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `ending_point` calculation to include the correct number of characters. Additionally, there are issues with replacing the `block` in `docstring_slice` and the incorrect handling of list elements in the `lines` variable.

We can address these issues by updating the code to correctly calculate the `ending_point` and replace the `block` in `docstring_slice`. Moreover, we need to handle all list elements properly in the `lines` variable.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]  # Exclude the final newline character
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]

    indent = 0
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '- ' + line[leading_spaces:]
        elif line:
            lines[i] = ' ' * 4 + line

    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The provided corrected code revises the logic for calculating `ending_point` and handles the replacement of `block` in `docstring_slice`. Additionally, it properly handles all list elements in the `lines` variable, which include adding back the leading spaces and dashes for list items.
