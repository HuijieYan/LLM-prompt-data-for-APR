The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the function `test_doc_lists`. The issue seems to be related to the formatting of the output, specifically the handling of list elements.

The potential error location within the `process_list_block` function is likely in the section that handles the indentation and formatting of list elements. It seems that the function is not correctly formatting the list items and is failing to convert them into the expected Markdown format.

The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly handling the formatting and indentation of list items within the input docstring.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly detect and format list items, including their indentation and bullet points for Markdown. Additionally, the function needs to correctly handle the replacement of the list block in the docstring with the provided marker.

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    
    # Convert list elements to Markdown format
    lines = [re.sub(r'- ([^:]+):(.*)', r'- __\1__: \2', line) for line in lines]
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```
