The test case is comparing the output of the `autogen.process_docstring()` function with an expected result using the `markdown` function, which suggests that the error may be in the `process_docstring` function.

The error message is indicating that there is a difference in the formatting of the output. It seems that the expected result is formatted as an unordered list (`<ul>`) while the actual output is formatted as paragraphs (`<p>`).

The error is likely occurring in the conversion of the input `docstring` into the `block` within the `process_list_block` function. The bug may be related to the transformation of list items within the `block`.

The code should be corrected to properly convert list items into an unordered list format.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Convert list items into unordered list format
    lines = [re.sub(r'^([ ]*)(-)(.*)', r'\1- \3', line) for line in lines]
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
``` 

In the corrected code, I added a step to convert list items into unordered list format using regular expressions. This should resolve the formatting issue observed in the error message.
