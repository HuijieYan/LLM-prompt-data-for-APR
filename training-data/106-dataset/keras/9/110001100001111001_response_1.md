The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the calculation of the `ending_point` and the subsequent generation of the `block` variable. It appears that the `ending_point` calculation does not work as expected, causing incorrect slicing of the `docstring`.

The ending_point is calculated using `ending_point - 1`, which is problematic because if `ending_point` is -1 as in the provided test case, it will result in extracting only a portion of the `docstring`. Additionally, the use of `None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point - 1` seems unnecessary and overly complex.

To fix this bug, the `ending_point` calculation should be simplified and handled separately when it is equal to -1.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    
    if ending_point != -1:
        block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point - 1]
    else:
        block = docstring[starting_point:]
    
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    
    return docstring, block
```

This corrected code handles the case when `ending_point` is equal to -1 and simplifies the logic for extracting the `block` from the `docstring`. It also maintains other functionality in the function while handling the problematic logic.
