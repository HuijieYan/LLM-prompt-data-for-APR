The bug seems to be related to the function `process_list_block` which is used to process the docstring and reformat it. It seems to be incorrectly identifying the end of the block and not removing the correct section of `docstring`.

The function `process_list_block` incorrectly identifies the end of the block by using `docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)`. This might not always work correctly as the ending might not always be followed by two new lines. This is why the `ending_point` value is always `-1`.

Additionally, the processing of `docstring_slice` and `block` seems to be incorrect, which results in incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to rework how the ending point of the block is identified and revise the processing of `docstring_slice` and `block`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    # Gets the index of the next two new lines after the starting_point
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    if ending_point == -1:
        ending_point = len(docstring)
    
    # Extract the block from the docstring based on the starting and ending points
    block = docstring[starting_point:ending_point]

    # Replace the block with the marker in the docstring slice
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])

    # Process the block
    lines = block.split('\n')
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    lines = [re.sub(r'^- ', '- __', line) for line in lines]

    # Join the processed lines to form the block
    block = '\n'.join(lines)

    return docstring, block
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with identifying the end of the block and the processing of `docstring_slice` and `block`. It should now properly format the docstrings.
