The bug in the function `process_list_block` seems to be related to the manipulation of the `docstring` and the `block` variable, as well as the manipulation of the list `lines`. The function attempts to replace a block of text in the `docstring` with a marker, and then modifies the `block` and `lines` variables based on the original `docstring` and the marked section. However, the processing of the `block` and `lines` variables seems to be incorrect in the original function.

The bug is likely resulting from incorrect slicing and manipulation of the `block` and `lines` variables. The incorrect handling of the `block` variable is leading to incorrect output, causing issues with the documentation formatting.

To fix this bug, it seems necessary to update the function to correctly slice the `block` from the `docstring` and then process the `block` and `lines` variables in a way that retains the original formatting and list structure.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end, leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```

The corrected code addresses the incorrect slicing and processing of the `block` and `lines` variables, ensuring that the original formatting and list structure is retained. This should fix the underlying issue of incorrect documentation formatting.
