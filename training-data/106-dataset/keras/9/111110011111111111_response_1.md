The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the processing of the `block` variable. The `ending_point` computation and the subsequent manipulation of the `docstring` and `block` variables may not be working as intended, leading to incorrect output.

The bug in the `process_list_block` function is causing incorrect markdown conversion and assertion failure in the test case.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary adjustments to the ending_point and docstring variables.
2. Adjust the block slicing to ensure that the complete block is captured.
3. Correct the regex patterns and replacements for proper formatting of list items.
4. Ensure that the indent and text_block logic properly handles the list items and text blocks.

Here's the corrected `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re
def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    block = docstring[starting_point:section_end]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^ {4}([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^ {4}', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        if line.strip().startswith('-'):
            lines[i] = '- ' + line.lstrip('-')
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
