The bug in the `process_list_block` function seems to be related to the handling of the `ending_point` and `block` variables. The `ending_point` is being calculated correctly, but the conditional statement that follows might not be working as intended, resulting in an incorrect slice of the `docstring`. This, in turn, affects the slicing and manipulation of the `block`.

The bug appears to be causing the unexpected results in the `test_doc_lists` function, leading to an assertion error. The bug is likely causing the incorrect generation of markdown, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement that handles the slicing of the `docstring` based on the `ending_point` should be revised to ensure that the correct slice, including the `ending_point`, is obtained. Additionally, the manipulation of the `block` and its formatting should be reviewed to ensure the correct generation of markdown.

Here's the corrected version of the `process_list_block` function:

```python
import re

def process_list_block(docstring, starting_point, section_end,
                       leading_spaces, marker):
    ending_point = docstring.find('\n\n', starting_point)
    block = docstring[starting_point:(None if ending_point == -1 else
                                      ending_point)]
    # Place marker for later reinjection.
    docstring_slice = docstring[starting_point:section_end].replace(block, marker)
    docstring = (docstring[:starting_point]
                 + docstring_slice
                 + docstring[section_end:])
    lines = block.split('\n')
    # Remove the computed number of leading white spaces from each line.
    lines = [re.sub('^' + ' ' * leading_spaces, '', line) for line in lines]
    # Usually lines have at least 4 additional leading spaces.
    # These have to be removed, but first the list roots have to be detected.
    top_level_regex = r'^    ([^\s\\\(]+):(.*)'
    top_level_replacement = r'- __\1__:\2'
    lines = [re.sub(top_level_regex, top_level_replacement, line) for line in lines]
    # All the other lines get simply the 4 leading space (if present) removed
    lines = [re.sub(r'^    ', '', line) for line in lines]
    # Fix text lines after lists
    indent = 0
    text_block = False
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        line = lines[i]
        spaces = re.search(r'\S', line)
        if spaces:
            # If it is a list element
            if line[spaces.start()] == '-':
                indent = spaces.start() + 1
                if text_block:
                    text_block = False
                    lines[i] = '\n' + line
            elif spaces.start() < indent:
                text_block = True
                indent = spaces.start()
                lines[i] = '\n' + line
        else:
            text_block = False
            indent = 0
    block = '\n'.join(lines)
    return docstring, block
```
