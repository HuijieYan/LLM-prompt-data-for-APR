Certainly! Here's the full corrected code for the `rnn` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

    # Arguments
        step_function: RNN step function.
            Parameters:
                inputs: tensor with shape `(samples, ...)` (no time dimension),
                    representing input for the batch of samples at a certain
                    time step.
                states: list of tensors.
            Returns:
                outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, output_dim)`
                    (no time dimension).
                new_states: list of tensors, same length and shapes
                    as 'states'. The first state in the list must be the
                    output tensor at the previous timestep.
        inputs: tensor of temporal data of shape `(samples, time, ...)`
            (at least 3D).
        initial_states: tensor with shape (samples, output_dim)
            (no time dimension),
            containing the initial values for the states used in
            the step function.
        go_backwards: boolean. If True, do the iteration over the time
            dimension in reverse order and return the reversed sequence.
        mask: binary tensor with shape `(samples, time, 1)`,
            with a zero for every element that is masked.
        constants: a list of constant values passed at each step.
        unroll: whether to unroll the RNN or to use a symbolic loop (`while_loop` or `scan` depending on backend).
        input_length: not relevant in the TensorFlow implementation.
            Must be specified if using unrolling with Theano.

    # Returns
        A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.

            last_output: the latest output of the rnn, of shape `(samples, ...)`
            outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, time, ...)` where each
                entry `outputs[s, t]` is the output of the step function
                at time `t` for sample `s`.
            new_states: list of tensors, latest states returned by
                the step function, of shape `(samples, ...)`.

    # Raises
        ValueError: if input dimension is less than 3.
        ValueError: if `unroll` is `True` but input timestep is not a fixed number.
        ValueError: if `mask` is provided (not `None`) but states is not provided
            (`len(states)` == 0).

Please make sure to test the function with relevant test cases to ensure its correctness.
