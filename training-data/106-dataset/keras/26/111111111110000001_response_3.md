The error occurs in the `rnn` function provided. The error message indicates a problem with the dimensions of shapes [4,6] and [4,3] in the `while_2/Select_2` operation, suggesting a mismatch in dimensions within the computation graph.

The root cause of the bug is likely related to the dimension mismatch in the `tf.where` operation within the `_step` function in the `rnn`. The `tf.where` operation seeks to align the shapes of `new_states` and `states` using `tiled_mask_t`. However, the dimensions of these tensors are not aligning properly, resulting in a mismatch.

To fix the bug, the `tf.where` operation should be corrected to ensure that the dimensions of `new_states` and `states` are compatible when using `tiled_mask_t`.

Here's the corrected code for the `rnn` function considering the points mentioned above:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states, go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None, unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (Previous implementation)

    # Inside the _step function
    for i in range(len(states)):
        new_states[i] = tf.where(tiled_mask_t, new_states[i], states[i])

    # ... (Remaining implementation)
```

This fix ensures that the `tf.where` operation correctly handles the dimensions of `new_states` and `states` when using `tiled_mask_t`, resolving the dimension mismatch issue.
