The error message states that there's a shape mismatch in the 'Select' operation inside the '_step' function of the rnn method. This is caused by a dimension mismatch between the input shapes for the 'Select' operation: [4,6] and [4,3].

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect handling of shapes when masking is applied to the states. The code inside the '_step' function, specifically the section where 'tf.where' is used to handle the masked states, is likely causing the shape mismatch.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the code to ensure that the shapes of the tensors being used in the 'tf.where' operation are compatible.
2. Verify that the correct dimensions are being used when performing the masking and applying it to the states.
3. Make sure that the shapes of the tensors after masking are consistent and compatible with the 'Select' operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'rnn':

        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """
    Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

    Args:
        step_function: RNN step function.
        inputs: tensor of temporal data of shape `(samples, time, ...)` (at least 3D).
        initial_states: tensor with shape (samples, output_dim) (no time dimension),
                        containing the initial values for the states used in the step function.
        go_backwards: boolean. If True, do the iteration over the time dimension in reverse order and return the reversed sequence.
        mask: binary tensor with shape `(samples, time, 1)`, with a zero for every element that is masked.
        constants: a list of constant values passed at each step.
        unroll: whether to unroll the RNN or to use a symbolic loop.
        input_length: not relevant in the TensorFlow implementation.

    Returns:
        A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.
