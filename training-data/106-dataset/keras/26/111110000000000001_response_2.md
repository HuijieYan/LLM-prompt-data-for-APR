The potential error in the provided function is within the section that handles the "unroll" parameter. The bug seems to be related to how the function is dealing with the masking of the inputs, causing issues with the shape of the tensors. This is evident from the complexity of the code and the potential for mismatched shapes.

It seems that the bug occurred due to improper handling of the mask tensor and its interaction with the input and initial states.

To fix the bug, it is advisable to simplify the logic and ensure that the mask is properly applied to the inputs and states.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """
    Iterates over the time dimension of a tensor.

    Args:
        step_function: RNN step function.
        inputs: tensor of temporal data of shape `(samples, time, ...)`
            (at least 3D).
        initial_states: tensor with shape (samples, output_dim)
            (no time dimension).
        go_backwards: boolean. If True, do the iteration over the time
            dimension in reverse order and return the reversed sequence.
        mask: binary tensor with shape `(samples, time, 1)`,
            with a zero for every element that is masked.
        constants: a list of constant values passed at each step.
        unroll: whether to unroll the RNN or to use a symbolic loop
            (`while_loop` or `scan` depending on backend).
        input_length: not relevant in the TensorFlow implementation.
            Must be specified if using unrolling with Theano.

    Returns:
        A tuple, `(last_output, outputs, new_states)`.

            last_output: the latest output of the rnn, of shape `(samples, ...)`
            outputs: tensor with shape `(samples, time, ...)` where each
                entry `outputs[s, t]` is the output of the step function
                at time `t` for sample `s`.
            new_states: list of tensors, latest states returned by
                the step function, of shape `(samples, ...)`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if input dimension is less than 3.
    """
    ndim = len(inputs.get_shape())
    if ndim < 3:
        raise ValueError('Input should be at least 3D.')

            else:
