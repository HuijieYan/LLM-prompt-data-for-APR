Based on the error message, it seems that there is an issue with the shapes of the tensors being used in the `tf.where` operation inside the `_step` function of the `rnn` method. The error indicates that the shapes of the tensors provided to the `tf.where` operation do not match.

The error is likely occurring due to incorrect shapes of tensors being used with `tf.where`. It's possible that the shapes are not being handled correctly when applying the mask to the output and states.

To fix this bug, the shapes of the tensors inside the `_step` function need to be aligned correctly when using the `tf.where` operation. This may involve reshaping or broadcasting the mask to match the shape of the tensors before applying it.

Here's the corrected code for the `rnn` function with the potential fix for the bug:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states, go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None, unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Inside the _step function
    def _step(time, output_ta_t, *states):
        """RNN step function.

        # Arguments
            time: Current timestep value.
            output_ta_t: TensorArray.
            *states: List of states.

        # Returns
            Tuple: `(time + 1,output_ta_t) + tuple(new_states)`
        """
        current_input = input_ta.read(time)
        mask_t = mask_ta.read(time)
        output, new_states = step_function(current_input, tuple(states) + tuple(constants))
        if getattr(output, '_uses_learning_phase', False):
            global uses_learning_phase
            uses_learning_phase = True
        for state, new_state in zip(states, new_states):
            new_state.set_shape(state.get_shape())
        # Adjust the shapes of the tensors before applying the mask
        tiled_mask_t = tf.tile(mask_t, tf.stack([1, tf.shape(output)[1]]))
        output = tf.where(tiled_mask_t, output, states[0])
        new_states = [tf.where(tiled_mask_t, new_states[i], states[i]) for i in range(len(states))]
        output_ta_t = output_ta_t.write(time, output)
        return (time + 1, output_ta_t) + tuple(new_states)
        
    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In this corrected code, the shapes of the tensors are adjusted before applying the mask using the `tf.where` operation inside the `_step` function. This should address the issue of mismatched shapes causing the error.
