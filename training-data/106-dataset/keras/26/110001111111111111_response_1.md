The error message indicates a dimension mismatch when the `tf.where` function is used within the `_step` function in the `rnn` method. The shapes of the inputs to the `tf.where` function are [4,3], [4,6], [4,6], but they need to be consistent.

The bug seems to be happening because the shape of the input `new_state` is being concatenated to create the tensor to be used in the `tf.where` function, resulting in a shape [4,6] instead of [4,3].

To fix this bug, the `new_state` should be used directly in the `tf.where` call, without any modification to its shape.

Here's the corrected version of the `rnn` method:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # ... (previous code) ...

    def _step(time, output_ta_t, *states):
        """RNN step function.

        # Arguments
            time: Current timestep value.
            output_ta_t: TensorArray.
            *states: List of states.

        # Returns
            Tuple: `(time + 1,output_ta_t) + tuple(new_states)`
        """
        current_input = input_ta.read(time)
        mask_t = mask_ta.read(time) if mask is not None else None
        output, new_states = step_function(current_input, tuple(states) + tuple(constants))
        if getattr(output, '_uses_learning_phase', False):
            global uses_learning_phase
            uses_learning_phase = True
        for state, new_state in zip(states, new_states):
            new_state.set_shape(state.get_shape())
        if mask_t is not None:
            output = tf.where(mask_t, output, states[0])
            new_states = [tf.where(mask_t, new_states[i], states[i]) for i in range(len(states))]
        output_ta_t = output_ta_t.write(time, output)
        return (time + 1, output_ta_t) + tuple(new_states)

    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

In the corrected code, the `new_state` is not modified before used in the `tf.where` call. This ensures that the shapes remain consistent throughout the function.
