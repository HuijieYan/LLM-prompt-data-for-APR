The error occurs when the function `rnn` is called. It seems that the problem lies in the implementation of the `tf.where` function within the `_step` function of the `rnn` method.

The error message "Dimension 1 in both shapes must be equal, but are 6 and 3" indicates that there's a dimension mismatch when `tf.where` is used. This implies that the shapes of the tensors involved in the `tf.where` operation are not compatible.

The bug seems to be caused by an incorrect usage of `tf.where` within the `_step` function of the `rnn` method, resulting in the dimension mismatch error.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the `tf.where` function within the `_step` function should be reviewed to ensure that the shapes of the tensors involved are compatible.

Corrected code for the problematic function `rnn`:
```python
# Corrected and updated rnn method/function
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    """

    # Corrected _step function
    def _step(time, output_ta_t, *states):
        current_input = input_ta.read(time)
        mask_t = mask_ta.read(time)
        output, new_states = step_function(current_input, tuple(states) + tuple(constants))
        if getattr(output, '_uses_learning_phase', False):
            global uses_learning_phase
            uses_learning_phase = True
        for state, new_state in zip(states, new_states):
            new_state.set_shape(state.get_shape())
        tiled_mask_t = tf.tile(mask_t, tf.stack([1, tf.shape(output)[-1]]))  # Corrected dimension for tiling
        output = tf.where(tiled_mask_t, output, states[0])  # Updated usage of tf.where with correct dimensions
        new_states = [tf.where(tiled_mask_t, new_states[i], states[i]) for i in range(len(states))]  # Updated usage of tf.where with correct dimensions
        output_ta_t = output_ta_t.write(time, output)
        return (time + 1, output_ta_t) + tuple(new_states)

    # Existing code remains unchanged for brevity
    # (...)
    # The remaining code of the `rnn` method remains unchanged for brevity.

    axes = [1, 0] + list(range(2, len(outputs.get_shape())))
    outputs = tf.transpose(outputs, axes)
    last_output._uses_learning_phase = uses_learning_phase
    return last_output, outputs, new_states
```

The corrected implementation ensures that the `tf.where` function is used with tensors of compatible shapes, addressing the dimension mismatch error.
