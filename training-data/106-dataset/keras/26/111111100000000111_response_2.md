There are several potential issues with the provided function:

1. The function uses TensorFlow-specific code which will not work without importing the TensorFlow library at the beginning of the file.
2. The function attempts to use undefined variables, such as `tf` and `tensor_array_ops` without importing the necessary libraries.

To fix these issues, the function should be placed in a proper TensorFlow script and the necessary TensorFlow libraries should be imported. Additionally, the undefined variables such as `tf` and `tensor_array_ops` should be imported from the TensorFlow library.

Here's an example of how to fix these issues:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import tensor_array_ops
from tensorflow.python.ops import control_flow_ops

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... function code ...
    pass
```

This fixes the issue by providing the necessary imports for the TensorFlow functions and objects used within the `rnn` function.
