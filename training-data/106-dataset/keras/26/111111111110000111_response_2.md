The error occurs when the function `rnn` is attempting to unroll the RNN in the TensorFlow backend and manipulate the mask to handle masked timesteps. The error is related to the dimension mismatch when attempting to broadcast the mask.

The bug occurs due to a dimension mismatch when trying to broadcast the mask to match the shape of the output. This is likely happening because the shapes of the mask and the output are not compatible for broadcasting.

To fix the bug, the dimension mismatch between the mask and the output needs to be addressed. This can be achieved by modifying the broadcasting process or reshaping the mask to make it compatible with the output's shape.

Below is the corrected code for the `rnn` function:

```python
def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states, go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None, unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # Replace the broadcasting and management of mask
    if mask is not None:
        if mask.dtype != tf.bool:
            mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.bool)
        
        # Ensure that the mask and output shapes are compatible for broadcasting
        if mask.get_shape().is_compatible_with(inputs.get_shape()):
            mask = tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1)

        mask = tf.transpose(mask, perm=[1, 0, 2])  # Transpose the mask before further processing

    # ... (rest of the function)
```

The provided modification ensures that the mask dimensions are suitable for broadcasting with the output, addressing the dimension mismatch error.
