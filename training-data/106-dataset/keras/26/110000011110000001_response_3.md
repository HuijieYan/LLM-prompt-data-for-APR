The error occurs when the function `rnn` is executed using the test case `test_rnn_additional_states` provided. The error message states that the shapes of two tensors (with shapes [4,6] and [4,3]) are incompatible for an operation involving a Select operation.

The potential error location is identified within the TensorFlow operation in the `_step` function of the `rnn` method, which is involving the `Select` operation.

The bug occurs due to the mismatch in dimensions of the tensors while performing the `Select` operation in the `_step` function. This can happen if the dimensions of the input tensors are not appropriately handled for operations such as tile, where, while implementing the rnn.

To fix the bug, the dimensions of the tensors should be appropriately handled, especially when performing the `Select` operation. The code should ensure that the dimensions of the tensors match properly for the `Select` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def rnn(step_function, inputs, initial_states,
        go_backwards=False, mask=None, constants=None,
        unroll=False, input_length=None):
    # other code remains the same
    if unroll:
        if not inputs.get_shape()[0]:
            raise ValueError('Unrolling requires a '
                             'fixed number of timesteps.')
        states = initial_states
        successive_states = []
        successive_outputs = []

        input_list = tf.unstack(inputs)
        if go_backwards:
            input_list = reversed(input_list)

        if mask is not None:
            mask_list = tf.unstack(mask)
            if go_backwards:
                mask_list = reversed(mask_list)

        for i, inp in enumerate(input_list):
            if mask is not None:
                mask_t = mask_list[i]

            output, new_states = step_function(inp, states + constants)
            if getattr(output, '_uses_learning_phase', False):
                uses_learning_phase = True

            if mask is not None:
                output = tf.where(mask_t, output, successive_outputs[-1] if i > 0 else tf.zeros_like(output))
                states = [tf.where(mask_t, new_states[j], states[j]) for j in range(len(states))]

            successive_outputs.append(output)
            successive_states.append(new_states)
        last_output = successive_outputs[-1]
        new_states = successive_states[-1]
        outputs = tf.stack(successive_outputs)

    # other code remains the same
```
In the corrected code, the `Select` operation is explicitly handled when performing the operation with `tf.where` to ensure that the dimensions of the tensors are properly matched.
