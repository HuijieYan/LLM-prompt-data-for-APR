Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `y = np.array(y, dtype='int')` as the numpy library has not been imported, so the function will be unable to recognize the `np` abbreviation.

Reason for the bug: The numpy library has not been imported, so the function is unable to recognize the `np` abbreviation and will raise an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the numpy library at the beginning of the function so that the function can recognize the `np` abbreviation.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
