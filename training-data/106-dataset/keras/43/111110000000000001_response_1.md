Potential Error Location: 
The issue lies in the condition `if not num_classes`, which is meant to check if `num_classes` is None. However, since 0 is a valid input for the `num_classes` parameter, the condition might not work as intended.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if not num_classes` does not accurately check if `num_classes` is None. It is incorrectly assuming that if `num_classes` is 0, it should be considered as None, which is not the case.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Instead of using `if not num_classes`, we can use `if num_classes is None` to accurately check if `num_classes` is None.

Updated Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
