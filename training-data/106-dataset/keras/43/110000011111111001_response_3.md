The error message states that the shape of `one_hot` does not match the expected shape at index 1. This indicates that the bug is occurring in the `to_categorical` function.

The reason for the bug is that the output shape is being calculated incorrectly. The function is adding an extra dimension to the output, causing the shape mismatch with the expected shape.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of the output shape so that it matches the expected shape provided in the test case.

Here's the corrected `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```
