The bug is occurring in the `to_categorical` function as the output shape is not matching the expected shape in the test function. The error message indicates that the shape of the output `one_hot` variable is not matching the expected shape. 

The issue is likely due to the reshaping done incorrectly while converting the input array to a binary class matrix. The output shape is being calculated as `(input_shape + (num_classes,))`, which is leading to unexpected shapes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the reshaping by removing the `input_shape` variable and directly use the number of classes to reshape the binary matrix.

Here's the corrected `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
```
