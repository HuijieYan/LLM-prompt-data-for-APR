The error message indicates that the output shape of the function is not as expected. The test expects the shapes to be (3, 5), (4, 3, 5), (5, 4, 3, 5), or (3, 5) based on the input, but the actual output shapes are different.

After analyzing the code, it can be seen that the error occurred due to an issue with reshaping the array to the expected output shape. The buggy function is not correctly reshaping the array to the desired shape based on the input.

To fix the bug, the reshaping logic needs to be adjusted to ensure that the output shape matches the expected_shape provided in the test.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    # Use integer array indexing to create the one-hot encoding
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = categorical.reshape(input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```

The above corrected function will reshape the array to the expected output shape based on the input parameters and return the correct one-hot encoding.
