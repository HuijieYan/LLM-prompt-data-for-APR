Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring in the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1`, where it attempts to assign 1 to the categorical array based on the indices from `y`.

Reason behind the bug: 
The bug occurs because it seems to be assuming that `y` is a 1D array, but it's not ensuring that 'y' is a 1D array before trying to use it as indices.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
We can fix the bug by first ensuring that `y` is flattened to a 1D array before using it as indices.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
