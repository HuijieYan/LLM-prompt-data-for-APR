Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the line `categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1` where it is trying to assign a value to a 2D array using a 1D array as an index.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the function is trying to reshape the 2D array `categorical` into a higher dimensional array, but the reshaping process is not being done correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to reshape the `categorical` array properly to match the `output_shape` dimensions and correctly assign the values to this reshaped array.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1

    # Reshape the categorical array properly
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)

    return categorical
```
