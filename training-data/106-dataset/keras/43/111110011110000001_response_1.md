The test function `test_to_categorical()` is validating the output shape of the `to_categorical` function against the expected shapes. The error message indicates that the shape of the output array from the `to_categorical` function does not match the expected shape for the second test case.

The issue in the `to_categorical` function is that when reshaping the array, it doesn't include the correct shape for the input, resulting in the mismatch of shapes during the comparison in the test function.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `to_categorical` function does not properly consider reshaping the output based on the input shape.

To fix the bug, the `to_categorical` function needs to properly reshape the categorical output based on the input shape provided.

Here's the corrected `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    
    y = y.ravel()
    
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    
    n = y.shape[0]
    
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)

    return categorical
```

With this correction, the `to_categorical` function will properly reshape the output based on the input shape, addressing the issue highlighted in the error message of the test function.
