The error message indicates that the shapes of the one-hot encoded values returned from the `to_categorical` function do not match the expected shapes. This suggests that the `to_categorical` function is not producing the correct output shapes.

The potential error in the `to_categorical` function is in the logic used to reshape the output matrix after converting the input class vector to a binary class matrix. The bug seems to be related to reshaping the binary matrix representation of the input to the output shape.

The bug occurs because the reshaping logic in the function is not consistent with the expected output shapes.

To fix the bug, the reshaping logic needs to be revised to align with the expected output shapes based on the input class vector and the number of classes.

Here's the corrected version of the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.
    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.
    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.
    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1

    categorical = np.zeros((y.shape[0], num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(y.shape[0]), y] = 1

    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    else:
        output_shape = (len(y), num_classes)
        
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

In this corrected version, the reshaping logic has been modified to handle both single and multi-dimensional input shapes, ensuring that the output shape matches the expected shape based on the input class vector and the number of classes.
