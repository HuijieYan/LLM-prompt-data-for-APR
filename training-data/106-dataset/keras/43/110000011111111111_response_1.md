The problem seems to be with the shape of the "one_hot" variable in the "test_to_categorical" function. The variable "one_hot" is not having the expected shape, and that is causing the assertion error.

The issue is with the reshaping of the "categorical" variable in the "to_categorical" function. Based on the expected test cases, it seems that the reshaping logic is not correctly handling the shapes of the input and output arrays of the "to_categorical" function.

To fix this issue, the reshaping logic needs to be modified to ensure that the shape of the output array matches the expected shape based on the input array and the number of classes.

Below is the corrected code for the "to_categorical" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```

The modified code handles the reshaping of the "categorical" variable by directly incorporating the input shape and number of classes into the reshaping operation. This ensures that the shape of the output array matches the expected shape, as specified in the test cases.
