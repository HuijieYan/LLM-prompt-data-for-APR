The bug in the code is related to the incorrect reshaping of the 'categorical' array. The bug occurs because the original shape of the input 'y' is not fully accounted for when reshaping the 'categorical' array.

The 'categorical' array is reshaped using the 'input_shape' and 'num_classes', but the correct order of dimensions is not preserved due to the use of the np.reshape function.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to use np.reshape with the correct order of dimensions: (num_samples, ...input_shape..., num_classes). This will ensure that the reshaping is done properly based on the actual shape of 'y'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = (n,) + input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
