Potential error location:
The error occurs in the shape comparison assertion `assert one_hot.shape == expected_shape`.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is occurring because the function `to_categorical` is not correctly reshaping the output into the expected shape. This is causing the discrepancy in shape comparison.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The output should be reshaped correctly to match the expected shape provided by the `expected_shapes` list.
2. The reshaping process should be modified within the `to_categorical` function to produce the correct shape for the binary matrix representation of the input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:  # Change condition to check if num_classes is None
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    for i in range(n):
        categorical[i, y[i]] = 1  # Set the correct index to 1 for each sample
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
