The issue with the `to_categorical` function is that it assumes the input array `y` to be one-dimensional, but it should work for multi-dimensional arrays as well. This assumption causes the function to reshape the input in a way that produces incorrect results and leads to the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle multi-dimensional input arrays properly. It should reshape the input array `y` to a one-dimensional array before the conversion to a categorical matrix. Also, the implementation should use the `np_utils` module, which seems to be missing from the original code.

Here's the corrected `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.utils import np_utils

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    y = y.reshape(-1)  # Flatten the input array to a one-dimensional array
    categorical = np_utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes)
    return categorical
```

With this correction, the function should now handle multi-dimensional input arrays correctly and produce the expected results.
