The bug in the `to_categorical` function lies in the way the output shape is calculated. The `output_shape` is being calculated using the input shape and the number of classes, but it is not taking into account whether the input `y` is a 1D, 2D, or 3D array.

The `output_shape` should be dynamically computed based on the input shape and the number of classes, ensuring the correct shape is returned for any dimensionality of the input `y`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function `to_categorical` as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    
    # Calculate output shape based on input shape and num_classes
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)

    # Reshape categorical to output shape
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With the aforementioned fix, the `output_shape` is being calculated taking into consideration the dimensionality of the input `y`, and the error encountered in the test case should be resolved.

The function should now work correctly for the different test cases.
