The issue with the `to_categorical` function is that it was originally built to handle 1D class vectors, but the input can be a multi-dimensional array. To fix the function, we need to ensure that it can handle multi-dimensional arrays.

One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the code to check if the input vector is multi-dimensional and handle it accordingly. We can also use the `np.reshape` method to reshape the output as a binary matrix representation of the input.

Here's the corrected function for the `to_categorical` method:

```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    
    if y.ndim > 1:  # If y is multi-dimensional
        y = y.ravel()
        input_shape = y.shape
    
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]

    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    
    if len(input_shape) > 1:  # If the input is multi-dimensional
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    else:
        output_shape = (n, num_classes)

    return categorical
```
