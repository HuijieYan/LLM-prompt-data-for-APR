The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when comparing the shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function (one_hot.shape) with the expected shape (expected_shape). The error occurs at index 1, where the shapes are different (1 != 5).

The potential error location within the problematic function is the reshaping process towards the end of the function. The output shape is calculated, and the categorical array is reshaped accordingly. It seems that the reshaping process is not handling multi-dimensional arrays correctly, resulting in mismatched shapes.

The bug occurs because the reshaping process assumes a single-column labels array, and it doesn't handle multi-dimensional arrays correctly.

To fix the bug, the reshaping logic should be modified to handle multi-dimensional arrays correctly. This can be achieved by reshaping the array with respect to its original shape.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    return categorical
```
