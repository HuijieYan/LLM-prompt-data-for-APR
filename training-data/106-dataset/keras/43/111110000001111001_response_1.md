Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the line that reshapes the 'categorical' array to 'output_shape'. It seems that the reshaping is not being performed correctly, resulting in incorrect 'output_shape' for all the test cases.

Reason for the bug: The reshaping of the 'categorical' array to 'output_shape' is not consistent with the actual dimensions of the input. The reshaping operation is incorrectly computing the dimensions of the 'output_shape' tuple.

Approach to fix the bug: To fix the bug, the reshaping operation needs to be performed correctly to ensure that the dimensions of 'output_shape' align with the shape of the input array 'y'. 

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)  # Correctly computing the shape of output
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
