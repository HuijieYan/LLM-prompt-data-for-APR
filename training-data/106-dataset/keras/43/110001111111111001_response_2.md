The error message indicates that the shape of the output one_hot array from the to_categorical function does not match the expected shape.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the output shape. This is because the current approach is not accounting for the original shape of the input array.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the categorical array to output_shape does not consider the original shape of the input array. It only uses the length of the input array, resulting in the incorrect shape of the output one_hot array.

To fix this bug, the input_shape should be used to determine the output_shape. This means incorporating the shape of the input array into the calculation of the output shape.

Here's the corrected code for the to_categorical function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
