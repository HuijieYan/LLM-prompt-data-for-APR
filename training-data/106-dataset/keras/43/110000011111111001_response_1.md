The error lies in the to_categorical function, particularly in the reshaping of the categorical array. The incorrect output is causing the assertions to fail.

The bug occurs because when the input y has more than one dimension, the shape of the output is not computed correctly. The current categorical array is reshaped using the input_shape and num_classes in a naive manner which creates the incorrect shape.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be used:
1. Check the number of dimensions in the input y. If the input has one dimension, the reshaping process should follow the previous logic. If the input has more than one dimension, the reshaping should be adjusted accordingly.
2. Calculate the output_shape based on the number of dimensions in the input y and the num_classes.
3. Reshape the categorical array using the calculated output_shape.

Here's the corrected code for the to_categorical function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    else:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, (n, num_classes))
    return categorical
```

With this corrected function, the reshaping logic for the categorical array has been updated to handle both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional inputs correctly. This should fix the bug and make the assertions in the test function pass.
