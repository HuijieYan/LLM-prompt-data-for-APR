potential error location: 
In the function `to_categorical`, we initialize the variable `input_shape` as `y.shape` but later the value of `input_shape` is not utilized anywhere in the code. This creates redundancy in the code and might lead to confusion.

Explain the reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the failure to properly utilize the `input_shape` variable, which is calculated but not used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can remove the `input_shape` variable, as it is not being used anywhere in the code. Additionally, we can simplify the code by removing calculations that are not necessary for achieving the desired functionality.

Corrected code:
```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
