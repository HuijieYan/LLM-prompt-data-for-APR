The bug in the given function is due to the wrong calculation of the output shape. The function wrongly reshapes the array to include the num_classes dimension in the output shape. This results in incorrect reshaping, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the output shape should be calculated based on the number of classes and the input shape. The correct output shape should be the input shape followed by a new axis with size num_classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    n = y.shape[0]
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
