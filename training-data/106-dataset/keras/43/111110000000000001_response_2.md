Potential error location: The if statement `if not num_classes` is causing the bug because it is checking if `num_classes` is falsy, which is not the correct condition for determining if `num_classes` has been provided.

Reasons for bug occurrence: The bug occurs because the if statement is not correctly checking whether `num_classes` has been provided. As a result, the default value of `num_classes` is not being used when it is not provided.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Change the condition in the if statement to check if `num_classes` is None instead of using a truthiness check.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
