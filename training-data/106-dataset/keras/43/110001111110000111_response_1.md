The test case uses the `to_categorical` function to convert a class vector into a binary class matrix. The function is expected to return the binary matrix in the shape specified by the variable `expected_shape`. However, the error message indicates that the shape of the returned binary matrix does not match the expected shape.

Upon analyzing the `to_categorical` function, the potential error location is the reshaping of the `categorical` array to match the output shape. The current implementation is incorrect in reshaping the categorical array using `np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)`. This results in the incorrect shape of the output matrix.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect reshaping of the `categorical` array. The desired output shape is not achieved because the reshaping does not match the expected shape.

To fix the bug, use `np.reshape` to reshape the array `categorical` to the desired output shape, calculating the new shape explicitly from the input shape and the number of classes.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    # Reshape the categorical array to match the output shape
    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    else:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, (n, num_classes))
    return categorical
```

With this correction, the `categorical` array is reshaped based on the input shape and the specified number of classes, ensuring that the output shape matches the expected shape.
