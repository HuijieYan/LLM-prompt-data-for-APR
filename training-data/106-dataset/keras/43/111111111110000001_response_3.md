The test case "test_to_categorical" is testing the "to_categorical" function by passing different shapes of labels to it and checking if the resulting one-hot encodings have the expected shapes. The error message shows that the expected shape is not matching the actual shape of the one-hot encoding, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error in the "to_categorical" function is the incorrect calculation of the "output_shape" variable. It is calculated using the "input_shape" and "num_classes," but the calculation is not correct, resulting in the mismatch of expected and actual shapes.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect reshaping of the one-hot encoded "categorical" array. The "output_shape" is being calculated incorrectly, leading to the reshaping issue.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly calculate the "output_shape" to ensure that the reshaping of the categorical array aligns with the expected shape. This can be achieved by correctly calculating the output shape based on the input shape and the number of classes.

Here's the corrected "to_categorical" function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape

    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1

    categorical = np.zeros((input_shape[0], num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(input_shape[0]), y] = 1

    return categorical.reshape(input_shape + (num_classes,))
```

This corrected function calculates the input shape and then reshapes the categorical array to include the number of classes in the shape. It fixes the bug that caused the mismatch in shapes and addresses the issue with reshaping.
