The bug in the provided function `to_categorical` is that it assumes the input `y` is a 1D array, but in some cases, it can be a 2D or 3D array, causing shape-related errors.

To fix this bug, we should first check the dimensionality of the input `y` and reshape it accordingly before processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.
    
    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.
    
    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.
        
    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    # Reshape y if it's not 1D
    if y.ndim > 1:
        y = y.ravel()
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
        n = y.shape[0]
        categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
        categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```

With the above modification, the function should now handle 1D, 2D, and 3D input arrays correctly and produce the expected output.
