The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `output_shape`. In the code, `output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)` is used to calculate the `output_shape`. This is leading to the shape being a tuple which appends the value of `num_classes` to the `input_shape` tuple, resulting in a different shape compared to the expected shape.

The bug is occurring because the `output_shape` calculation appends the value of `num_classes` to the `input_shape` tuple, instead of replacing the last value of the `input_shape` tuple with `num_classes`. As a result, the `output_shape` is not matching the expected shape in the test.

To fix the bug, the `output_shape` calculation should replace the last value of the `input_shape` tuple with `num_classes`, rather than appending `num_classes` to the tuple.

Below is the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape[:-1] + (num_classes,)  # Replace the last value with num_classes
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
``` 

After applying these changes, the `output_shape` will now correctly match the expected shape in the test.
