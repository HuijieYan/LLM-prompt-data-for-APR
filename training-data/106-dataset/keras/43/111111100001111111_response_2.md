Potential error location: The error might be arising in creating the `categorical` array because it is being reshaped to the `output_shape`.
Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the categorical matrix is not being created correctly, and the reshaping is leading to incorrect results.
Approaches to fix the bug:
1. Use one-hot encoding for the input `y` array to create the `categorical` matrix.
2. Reshape the `categorical` matrix after creating it with the correct dimensions.
3. Ensure that the input `y` is a 1-dimensional array and reshape it accordingly.
4. Check for the correctness of input `y` and `num_classes` before performing any calculations in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes)
        num_classes: total number of classes

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = y.shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
