Potential Error Location: The line `if not num_classes:` is likely causing an issue as it is using the truthiness of `num_classes` instead of checking if it is `None`.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when `num_classes` is not provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Change `if not num_classes` to `if num_classes is None`
- Add an explicit check for `None` for `num_classes`

Corrected Code:
```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes. If None, it will be inferred from the data.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
