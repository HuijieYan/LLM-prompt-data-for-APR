The issue with the `to_categorical` function is that it is not importing the `numpy` library. This is leading to the `NameError` when the function is being called in the test cases.

To fix this issue, the function should import the `numpy` library using the import statement `import numpy as np`.

Here is the corrected `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np  # Add this line to import numpy

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
