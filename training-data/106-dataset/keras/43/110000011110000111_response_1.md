The error message indicates that the shapes of the output from the `to_categorical` function are not matching the expected shapes. Specifically, it shows that for the shape (3,), the expected output should be (3, 5), but the actual output is (3, 1, 5). This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the input shape for 1D arrays.

The potential error within the `to_categorical` function is the reshaping process. It seems to assume a certain input shape and output shape, which may not be consistent for all input shapes.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly reshapes the array without considering the input shape. It is hardcoded for a 1-dimensional array, which causes issues when handling multi-dimensional arrays.

To fix the bug, the function should dynamically handle the input shape and adjust the reshaping process accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape

    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        y = y.ravel()

    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1

    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1

    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)

    return categorical
```

With this corrected code, the function correctly handles the input shape and dynamically adjusts the reshaping process to accommodate both 1D and multi-dimensional arrays. This should resolve the issue observed in the test function.
