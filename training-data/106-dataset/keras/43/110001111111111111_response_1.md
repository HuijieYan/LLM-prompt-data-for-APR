The error occurs in the test case due to the incorrect shape of the output from the `to_categorical` function. The expected shape is `(3, 5)` for the input shape `(3,)` and the number of classes `5`. However, the function returns a shape of `(3, 1, 5)`.

The potential error in the `to_categorical` function is the reshape operation on the `categorical` array. Instead of reshaping the array using the input shape and the number of classes, it is reshaped as `output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)`, which leads to the incorrect shape.

The bug occurs because in the reshaping step, the original shape of the `y` array is not properly accounted for when reshaping to a categorical array.

To fix this bug, we need to roll back the changes made to the variable `output_shape`. Instead, we should use the input shape and `num_classes` to reshape the categorical array. Additionally, we would remove the unnecessary line `y = y.ravel()`.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    return categorical
```

This corrected code should resolve the bug and align the `to_categorical` function output with the expected shape in the test function.
