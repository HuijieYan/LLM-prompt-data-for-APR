The issue with the given function is that it does not import the numpy library. Hence, whenever the function is called, it results in a NameError because the `np` object is not defined.

To fix this issue, we need to import the numpy library in the function file. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the Python file:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Once the numpy library is imported, the function should work as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
    y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
    (integers from 0 to num_classes).
    num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
    A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
