Potential error location: The issue is likely in the line "categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1". 

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the input class vector 'y' is not 0-indexed. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by explicitly specifying the number of classes and using one-hot encoding to convert the class vector to a binary class matrix.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    for i in range(n):
        categorical[i, y[i]] = 1
    return categorical
