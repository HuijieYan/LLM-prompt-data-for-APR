The issue with the given function is due to the shape of the output and the reshaping of the array.
The problematic function is to_categorical(y, num_classes=None).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the shape of the output is not being calculated correctly and the reshaping is not being performed appropriately. The reshaping of the array does not match the desired output_shape, which results in the bug.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to reshape the array using the input_shape and num_classes to get the correct output_shape. Additionally, the function should return the reshaped array as the binary matrix representation of the input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if num_classes is None:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    output_shape = input_shape + (num_classes,)
    categorical = np.reshape(categorical, output_shape)
    return categorical
```
