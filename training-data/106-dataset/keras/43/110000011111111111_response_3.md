The error message is indicating that the shapes of the returned array `one_hot` from the `to_categorical` function do not match the expected shapes in some test cases. Specifically, the error occurs when comparing `(3, 1, 5)` with `(3, 5)`.

The potential error location within the `to_categorical` function is when reshaping the `categorical` array to form the `output_shape`. This step likely causes the mismatch in dimensions observed in the error message.

The bug occurs because the reshaping of the `categorical` array to form the `output_shape` does not consider the shape when the input array has more than one dimension, leading to the mismatch.

There are several approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for reshaping the `categorical` array when more than one dimension is present in the input.
2. Modify the reshaping process to ensure that the `output_shape` correctly reflects the shape of the input array and the number of classes.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_categorical` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):
    """Converts a class vector (integers) to binary class matrix.

    E.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy.

    # Arguments
        y: class vector to be converted into a matrix
            (integers from 0 to num_classes).
        num_classes: total number of classes.

    # Returns
        A binary matrix representation of the input.
    """
    y = np.array(y, dtype='int')
    input_shape = y.shape
    y = y.ravel()
    if not num_classes:
        num_classes = np.max(y) + 1
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1

    if len(input_shape) > 1:
        # If input has more than one dimension
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, input_shape + (num_classes,))
    else:
        categorical = np.reshape(categorical, (n, num_classes))

    return categorical
```
