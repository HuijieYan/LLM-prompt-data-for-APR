The error message indicates that the layer `dense_1_input` does not support masking, despite being passed an input mask. This suggests that there is an issue with the implementation of the `InputLayer` class.

The potential error is located in the `InputLayer` class where it is not properly supporting masking, resulting in the error message during the execution of the `test_sequential_as_downstream_of_masking_layer` test case.

The bug occurs because the `compute_mask` method in the `InputLayer` class is not implemented to support masking. This leads to compatibility issues with downstream operations, causing the error when trying to pass an input mask to a layer that does not support masking.

To fix the bug, the `InputLayer` class needs to be updated to properly support masking. This can be achieved by implementing the `compute_mask` method in the class. By doing so, the layer will be able to handle input masks when used downstream, resolving the compatibility issue.

The corrected function for the `InputLayer` class is provided below:

```python
# Corrected InputLayer function
class InputLayer(Layer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None, batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @interfaces.legacy_input_support
    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
                 batch_input_shape=None,
                 dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
        if not name:
            prefix = 'input'
            name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
        super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)
    
        self.trainable = False
        self.built = True
        self.sparse = sparse
        self.supports_masking = True  # Add support for masking

        # ... omitted code ...
```

By adding support for masking in the `InputLayer` class, the bug causing the compatibility issue will be resolved.
