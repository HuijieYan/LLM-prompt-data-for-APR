The bug is causing an error related to masking for the dense layer and is likely due to changes in how masking is handled between versions 2.1.4 and 2.2.0 of Keras. 

The issue seems to be with the `Dense` layer not supporting masking in version 2.2.0, which causes an error with the `TimeDistributed` layer. This indicates that the bug might be in the `__init__` function of the `InputLayer` in the Keras source code, as this function is creating the input tensors and might not be correctly handling the masking behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `InputLayer` to correctly handle the masking behavior. This might involve checking the input shape and batch input shape, as well as ensuring that the masking is properly propagated through the input tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_input_support
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None,
             **kwargs):
    self.supports_masking = True  # Add support for masking

    # ... (omitted code)

    if input_tensor is None:
        self.is_placeholder = True
        input_tensor = K.placeholder(shape=batch_input_shape,
                                     dtype=dtype,
                                     sparse=sparse,
                                     name=self.name,
                                     **kwargs)  # Pass additional arguments to K.placeholder
    else:
        self.is_placeholder = False
        input_tensor._keras_shape = batch_input_shape

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected code, the `supports_masking` attribute is explicitly set to `True` to add support for masking. Additionally, the `K.placeholder` function for creating the input tensor is modified to accept additional keyword arguments that might be related to masking.

By making these changes, the bug related to masking should be resolved in Keras version 2.2.0.
