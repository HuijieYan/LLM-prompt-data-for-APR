In this case, the error occurs at the line `x = layers.wrappers.TimeDistributed(s)(x)` in the test function. The error message indicates that the layer `dense_1_input` does not support masking, but it was passed an input mask.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the masking support is not properly handled in the `TimeDistributed` layer. It seems that a change in the Keras 2.2.0 version might have caused this issue.

To fix this bug, the `TimeDistributed` layer should be modified to properly handle the input mask. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_input_support
def __init__(self, layer, **kwargs):
    super(TimeDistributed, self).__init__(layer, **kwargs)
    self.supports_masking = True

def compute_mask(self, inputs, mask=None):
    if self.layer.supports_masking:
        if mask is None:
            return None
        else:
            return mask
    else:
        return None
```

By updating the `TimeDistributed` layer to properly handle the input mask and mask propagation, this issue can be resolved.
