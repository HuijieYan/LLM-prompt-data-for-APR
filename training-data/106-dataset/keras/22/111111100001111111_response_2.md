The issue is likely caused by changes in the Keras library related to input masking support. The error message indicates that the layer "dense_1_input" does not support masking, but was passed an input mask. This suggests that there might be an issue with the input masking support for layers within Keras 2.2.0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of the `Masking` layer and its interaction with other layers, such as `Dense` and `TimeDistributed`.

Approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Examining the changes made to the input masking support in Keras 2.2.0 to identify any potential regressions or issues.
2. Checking the documentation and release notes for Keras 2.2.0 to see if there were any specific changes or updates related to input masking.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_input_support
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None, batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    self.supports_masking = True  # Add this line to enable input masking support
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)

    self.trainable = False
    self.built = True
    self.sparse = sparse

    if input_shape and batch_input_shape:
        raise ValueError('Only provide the input_shape OR '
                         'batch_input_shape argument to '
                         'InputLayer, not both at the same time.')
    
    # Rest of the original function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the key change is adding `self.supports_masking = True` to enable input masking support for the `InputLayer`. This change should address the issue related to input masking support in Keras 2.2.0.
