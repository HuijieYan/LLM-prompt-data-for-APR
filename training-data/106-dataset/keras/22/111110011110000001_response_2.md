The error occurs at the line `x = layers.wrappers.TimeDistributed(s)(x)` in the test function. The error message indicates that the layer `dense_1_input` does not support masking, but an input mask was passed to it.

The bug is in the `InputLayer` class. The function `compute_mask` of the layer (`dense_1_input`) does not support masking, but an input mask was passed to it. This is due to the incorrect handling of input masks in the `InputLayer` class.

To fix the bug, the `compute_mask` function in the `InputLayer` class needs to be modified to appropriately handle input masks.

Here's the corrected code for the `InputLayer` class:

```python
class InputLayer(Layer):

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None, batch_input_shape=None, dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @interfaces.legacy_input_support
    def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
                 batch_input_shape=None,
                 dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
        if not name:
            prefix = 'input'
            name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
        super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)
    
        self.trainable = False
        self.built = True
        self.sparse = sparse
        self._supports_masking = True  # Added to support masking

        # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the line `self._supports_masking = True`, we enable the `InputLayer` class to support masking, which should resolve the issue.
