Given the provided code and test cases, it appears that the InputLayer class has a bug where it does not properly handle the input parameters `input_shape`, `batch_size`, `batch_input_shape`, `dtype`, `input_tensor`, `sparse`, and `name`. 

The error message states that only one of `input_shape` or `batch_input_shape` should be provided, but according to the given code, it seems that both conditions are handled. This inconsistency leads to the conclusion that the bug is likely to occur when both `input_shape` and `batch_input_shape` are provided at the same time.

To fix the issue, the function should be modified to raise a ValueError if both `input_shape` and `batch_input_shape` are provided. Additionally, the logic of the rest of the function should be reviewed and tested thoroughly to ensure that it matches the expected behavior.

The corrected code for the function would be: 
```python
@interfaces.legacy_input_support
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None):
    if input_shape is not None and batch_input_shape is not None:
        raise ValueError('Only provide the input_shape OR '
                         'batch_input_shape argument to '
                         'InputLayer, not both at the same time.')
    
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name)

    self.trainable = False
    self.built = True
    self.sparse = sparse

    # rest of the code remains the same
```
The modifications include raising a ValueError if both `input_shape` and `batch_input_shape` are provided and removing the redundant code related to this condition check.
