The error occurs in the `layers.wrappers.TimeDistributed(s)` call, where the input layer is passed to the TimeDistributed layer. This results in a TypeError stating that "Layer dense_1_input does not support masking, but was passed an input_mask".

The bug occurs because the InputLayer does not support masking, which is a feature added in Keras 2.2.0. This is evident from the error trace where the issue arises due to the masking support.

To fix the bug, the InputLayer class should be modified to support masking. The correction involves updating the `__init__` method of the InputLayer class to include support for masking.

Here is the corrected code for the InputLayer class:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_input_support
def __init__(self, input_shape=None, batch_size=None,
             batch_input_shape=None,
             dtype=None, input_tensor=None, sparse=False, name=None, **kwargs):
    if not name:
        prefix = 'input'
        name = prefix + '_' + str(K.get_uid(prefix))
    super(InputLayer, self).__init__(dtype=dtype, name=name, supports_masking=True, **kwargs)

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
```

By adding `supports_masking=True` when initializing the InputLayer, we enable support for masking in the InputLayer.

This correction should resolve the issue and allow the code provided in the test function to run without errors.
