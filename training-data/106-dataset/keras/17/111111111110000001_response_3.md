Potential error:
The `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is not correctly implemented, which results in an inaccurate comparison between the values of `sparse_categorical_acc` and `categorical_acc` in the test function.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is not correctly comparing the true labels `y_true` with the predicted labels `y_pred`. The implementation does not use the correct logic to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function should use the correct logic to compare the true labels and the predicted labels, ensuring that the comparison is done in a way that reflects the sparse categorical accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    matches = K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
    return K.mean(matches)
```

In this corrected code, we first extract the indices of the maximum value in both `y_true` and `y_pred`. Then, we compare these indices to find the matches and calculate the mean of these matches to determine the accuracy. This approach reflects the correct calculation for sparse categorical accuracy.
