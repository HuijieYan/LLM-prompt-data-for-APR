The test function is comparing the results of two accuracy metrics: sparse_categorical_accuracy and categorical_accuracy. The error message indicates that the values produced by these two metrics are not close to each other, leading to an assertion failure.

The potential error in the problematic function lies in comparing the maximum value of y_true with the argmax of y_pred. The bug is present in the form of incorrect usage of K.cast and K.equal functions, resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the correct function should compare the index of the maximum value of y_true with the index of the maximum value of y_pred. Also, it should use the numerical value of the index rather than casting it to float.

The corrected function/method for sparse_categorical_accuracy is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
