# Corrected function
```python

from keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), 'float32')),
                  'float32')
```

Explanation:
1. The function is missing the import statement for `K` from the keras backend.
2. The error occurs because the `K` object is not defined within the function's scope.
3. The `K` object is required for casting and comparison operations.
4. The bug can be fixed by importing the `K` object from the keras backend and using it for casting and comparison operations.
5. The corrected code includes the import statement for `K` and uses it for casting and comparison operations within the function.
