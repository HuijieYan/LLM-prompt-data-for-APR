Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with how K.max and K.argmax are being used in the return statement. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the comparison between y_true and y_pred is not being handled correctly. Also, the use of K.max and K.argmax without proper handling of the dimensionality may be causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the proper functions to compare the values in y_true and y_pred.
2. Ensure that the dimensionality of y_true and y_pred is handled correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
