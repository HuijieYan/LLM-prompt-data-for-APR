Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `K.equal()` function, where the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` is not being handled correctly.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` using the `K.equal()` function. The function is not handling the comparison of sparse categorical data correctly.

Possible Approach to Fix:
We need to use the appropriate function to compare the sparse categorical data. The `sparse_categorical_accuracy` should compare the indices of the maximum values of `y_true` and `y_pred`, rather than the actual values.

Corrected Code:
```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
