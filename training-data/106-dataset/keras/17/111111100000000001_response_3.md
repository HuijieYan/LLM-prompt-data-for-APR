Potential error location: The error could be related to the use of the K.max function with y_true, which may not be the correct approach for calculating the maximum value over the last dimension.

Reasons behind the bug: The use of K.max with y_true is not the correct approach for calculating the maximum value over the last dimension. Instead, the function should compare the indices of the maximum values of y_true and y_pred.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use K.argmax to find the indices of the maximum values in y_true and y_pred.
- Compare the indices to check for equality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
