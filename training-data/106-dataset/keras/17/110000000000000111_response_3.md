The potential error in the provided code is that the K.max() function is being used on y_true which is not correct. 
The bug occurs because we are using K.max() to compare a one-hot encoded vector (y_true) with the index of the highest value in y_pred, which is not a correct comparison for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, we should use K.argmax() on both y_true and y_pred to get the indices of the maximum value, and then compare the two indices to check for equality.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), K.floatx())
```
