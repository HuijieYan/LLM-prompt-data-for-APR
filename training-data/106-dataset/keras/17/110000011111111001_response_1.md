The bug is likely located in the calculation of the sparse_categorical_accuracy within the problematic function. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two accuracy values is resulting in a False assertion.

The error occurs because the current implementation of the sparse_categorical_accuracy function is incorrect. The function is comparing whether the maximum value in y_true is equal to the argmax of y_pred, which does not accurately represent sparse categorical accuracy. Sparse categorical accuracy is typically calculated by comparing the index of the maximum value in y_pred with the corresponding value in y_true. Additionally, the return type of the function is not correct, and it should return the result as a tensor.

To fix the bug, the function implementation should be updated to correctly calculate sparse categorical accuracy and return a tensor value. Below is the corrected code for the sparse_categorical_accuracy function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred), K.floatx())
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, K.floatx())
    return K.mean(K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx()))
```

This implementation first casts y_pred to its argmax and then compares it with y_true to calculate the accuracy. Additionally, it uses K.mean to calculate the mean accuracy across all samples.
