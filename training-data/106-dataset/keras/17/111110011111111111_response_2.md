The `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is not correctly calculating the accuracy of the predictions. The bug is likely in the comparison between the true values and the predicted values.

The bug is likely occurring due to the fact that the `K.max` function is being used on `y_true`, which is a single-dimensional variable, and the comparison is being made with `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)`, which is a multi-dimensional variable. The dimensions of the comparison are not aligned properly, leading to incorrect accuracy calculations.

To fix this bug, we can use `tf.math.argmax` instead of `K.argmax` and compare the argmax values directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_labels = tf.cast(tf.math.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), tf.float32)
    y_true_labels = tf.cast(y_true, tf.float32)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true_labels, y_pred_labels), tf.float32))
```
