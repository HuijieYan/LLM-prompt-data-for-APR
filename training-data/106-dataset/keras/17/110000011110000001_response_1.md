The provided function `sparse_categorical_accuracy` seems to compare the true values `y_true` with the predicted values `y_pred` for sparse categorical accuracy. The error message suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual results when comparing the sparse categorical accuracy with categorical accuracy. This suggests there might be a bug in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `K.max` function. The `K.max` function is used in an incorrect way, leading to incorrect comparisons between the true and predicted values.

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` is not the correct way to obtain the maximum value in the `y_true` tensor. Instead of taking the maximum value, it returns the entire tensor `y_true`. This results in incorrect comparison between the true and predicted values.

To fix this bug, the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` should be replaced with `K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)`, which will return the indices of the maximum values along the given axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
