Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the comparison of y_true and y_pred using the K.argmax and K.equal functions.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be caused by incorrect data type conversion or a mismatch in the dimensions of y_true and y_pred.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that y_true and y_pred have the same dimensions before comparing them.
2. Check the data type conversion and ensure that it is appropriate for the comparison.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
