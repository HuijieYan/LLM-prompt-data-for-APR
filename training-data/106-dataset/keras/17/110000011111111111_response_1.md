The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function lies in the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred`. The `K.max` function is being used to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, and the `K.argmax` function is being used to find the index of the maximum value along the last axis of `y_pred`. However, it seems that the comparison logic is incorrect, which is resulting in an incorrect assertion failure in the test case.

The bug seems to be occurring because the comparison logic used in the function isn't correctly evaluating the sparse categorical accuracy. The function should be modified to calculate the accuracy based on the comparison between the true labels and the predicted probabilities.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy by comparing the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, as that is the standard way to calculate sparse categorical accuracy. Additionally, it's important to cast the result to `K.floatx()` to ensure the correct dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    acc = K.mean(K.cast(K.equal(true_labels, pred_labels), K.floatx()))
    return acc
```

By using the `argmax` function to extract the indices of the maximum values, and then comparing these indices to calculate the accuracy, the corrected function should now yield the expected results in the test case provided.
