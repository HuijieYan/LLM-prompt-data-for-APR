The potential error in the provided function is its incorrect implementation for calculating sparse categorical accuracy. The bug occurs because the K.max function is used on y_true, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum value across the last dimension for the true labels. 

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the K.argmax function on y_true to obtain the indices of the maximum value along the last dimension and then compare it with the argmax of y_pred.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
