The potential error in the provided function is that it's using Tensorflow-specific functions such as `K.cast`, `K.equal`, `K.max`, and `K.argmax` without importing the Keras backend. 

The `K` in the function refers to the Keras backend, and to fix this bug, you need to import the Keras backend and then use its functions to perform the desired operations.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(
        K.equal(
        K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
        K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
    K.floatx())
```
