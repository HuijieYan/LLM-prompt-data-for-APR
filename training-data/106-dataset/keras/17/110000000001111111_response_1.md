The potential error in the function `sparse_categorical_accuracy` lies in the comparison between the `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors. The use of `K.max` and `K.argmax` may not be appropriate for the given input shapes, causing the function to return an error.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare the maximum values of `y_true` along the last axis with the argmax of `y_pred` along the last axis, which may not be the correct approach for comparing sparse categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, we can use the `tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy` function, which is specifically designed for calculating the sparse categorical accuracy, rather than implementing it manually.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()
    accuracy.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
    return accuracy.result()
```
