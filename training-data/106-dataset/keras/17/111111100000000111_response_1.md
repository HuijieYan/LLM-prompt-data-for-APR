Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is the comparison between y_true and y_pred using K.max and K.argmax. The issue is that K.max should be used on y_pred instead of y_true.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because K.max is being used on y_true, which is not the correct approach. Instead, K.max should be used on y_pred to get the maximum value along the last axis.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use K.max on y_pred instead of y_true to get the maximum value along the last axis.
2. Use K.equal to compare the indices of the maximum value in y_pred with the indices of the maximum value in y_true.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
