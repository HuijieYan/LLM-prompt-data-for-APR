Potential error location: 
The error likely occurs in the line `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. The function `K.max` is used to find the maximum value along a specific axis in the tensor `y_true`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `y_true` tensor is a multidimensional tensor, and the `K.max` function is being applied with `axis=-1`, which may not be the correct axis for this tensor. Additionally, the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` is not being handled properly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `K.argmax` function to find the index of the maximum value in the `y_true` tensor along the correct axis.
2. Apply the `K.equal` function to compare the indices obtained from `y_true` and `y_pred`.
3. Modify the function to calculate the accuracy based on indices, rather than directly comparing the value of `y_true` and `y_pred`.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_17/keras/metrics.py

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_labels = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    y_true_labels = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true_labels, y_pred_labels), K.floatx())
```
