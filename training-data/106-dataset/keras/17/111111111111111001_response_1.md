The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred` using the `K.equal` and `K.cast` functions. This comparison is intended to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation does not correctly handle sparse categorical accuracy calculations. The bug might be due to incorrect handling of the input parameters `y_true` and `y_pred`, or the incorrect usage of `K.equal` and `K.cast` functions.

To fix the bug, we need to properly calculate the sparse categorical accuracy. The intended approach should involve converting `y_true` to its equivalent dense representation using one-hot encoding and then comparing it with `y_pred`.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true_dense = K.one_hot(K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1])
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true_dense, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)), K.floatx())
```

In the corrected code:
1. `y_true` is converted to its dense representation using `K.one_hot` function and the number of classes present in `y_pred`.
2. The comparison between the dense representation of `y_true` and `y_pred` is performed using `K.equal`.
3. The result is cast to `K.floatx()` data type before returning.

With this corrected code, the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function should now properly calculate the sparse categorical accuracy for the given input parameters.
