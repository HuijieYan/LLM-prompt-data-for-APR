Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `K.max` function on `y_true`, which has a shape of (6,). The `K.max` function is being used to find the maximum value along the last dimension, which may not work as intended for this input shape.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `K.max` function is used with the `axis=-1` parameter, which is not applicable for the shape of the input `y_true`. Additionally, the comparison using `K.equal` may not yield the desired result due to the incorrect usage of `K.max`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `K.argmax` function on `y_true` and `y_pred` separately to get the indices of the maximum values.
2. Compare the indices obtained from `K.argmax` instead of using `K.equal` and `K.max` as in the original function.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    pred_indices = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), K.floatx())
```
