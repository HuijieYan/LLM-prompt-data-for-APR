The potential error in the provided function is the use of `K.max` and `K.argmax` without specifying the correct axis. This may lead to mismatched dimensions when trying to compare `y_true` and `y_pred`.

The bug occurs because the function is comparing `y_true` and `y_pred` without aligning their dimensions properly. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and inaccurate accuracy calculations.

To fix the bug, we should specify the correct axis for `K.max` and `K.argmax` to ensure that the comparison is done along the correct axis.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```

In this corrected code, we are explicitly specifying the axis for both `K.max` and `K.argmax` to ensure the accuracy comparison is done along the correct axis.
