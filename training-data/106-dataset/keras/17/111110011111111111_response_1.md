The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is that it uses the `K.max` function with `y_true`, which has shape `(6,)`, and then compares it with `K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)`, which has shape `(6, 7)`. This causes a shape mismatch and leads to the error in the test case.

The function is intended to calculate the accuracy of the sparse categorical data, but due to the shape mismatch, it doesn't compute the accuracy correctly. To fix this bug, it's necessary to perform a comparison between the true labels and the predicted labels for accuracy calculation as intended.

Here's the corrected `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = tf.cast(y_true, tf.int64)
    y_pred = tf.cast(tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), tf.int64)
    matches = tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred), tf.float32)
    return tf.reduce_mean(matches)
```

In this corrected function, `tf.cast` is used to ensure that `y_true` and `y_pred` have the same data type (int64) for comparison. Then, `tf.equal` is used to compare the true and predicted labels, and the resulting matches are averaged using `tf.reduce_mean` to calculate the accuracy. This revised implementation addresses the shape mismatch and correctly computes the accuracy of the sparse categorical data.
