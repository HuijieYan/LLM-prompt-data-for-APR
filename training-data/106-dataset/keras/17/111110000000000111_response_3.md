Error:
The bug in the function is that it is not correctly calculating the sparse categorical accuracy. 

Bug location:
The bug is located in the comparison of y_true and y_pred.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison between y_true and y_pred is not taking into account the correct indexes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct indexes to compare y_true and y_pred.
2. Ensure that the comparison is done for each entry in y_true and y_pred.


# Corrected code
```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.equal(y_true, y_pred))
```
