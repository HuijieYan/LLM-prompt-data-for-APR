Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code lies in the comparison between y_true and y_pred using the K.max and K.argmax functions.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect use of the K.cast function and the K.max function. The K.max function is used to find the maximum value along an axis, but it is being applied on y_true which is not the correct usage. Additionally, the K.cast function is used in a way that may not be appropriate for the comparison between y_true and y_pred.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the appropriate method to compare y_true and y_pred for the 'sparse_categorical_accuracy' metric.
2. Ensure that the comparison results in a tensor with the correct shape and type.

Corrected Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
