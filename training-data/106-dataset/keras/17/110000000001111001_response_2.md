The potential error in the given function is the misuse of the K.argmax function and the comparison with K.equal. The function is trying to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy between the true values and the predicted values, but it's not using the correct operations.

The K.argmax function returns the indices of the maximum values along an axis, and it should be used to find the indices of the maximum values in y_true, not y_pred. Then, the equality between these indices and the actual maximum values in y_pred should be checked.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), tf.float32))
```
