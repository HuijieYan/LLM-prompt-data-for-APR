The error message indicates that the assert statement failed, meaning that the sparse_categorical_accuracy function did not produce the expected result when compared to the categorical_accuracy function.

The potential error in the sparse_categorical_accuracy function lies in the use of K.max(y_true, axis=-1), which tries to find the maximum value along the last axis of y_true. However, y_true may not be a one-hot encoded tensor and might have values other than 0 and 1. Therefore, finding the maximum value would not represent the class index for the true label.

To fix the bug, the sparse_categorical_accuracy function should first convert y_true to a one-hot encoded tensor and then compare it with the predictions in y_pred.

Here's the corrected code for the sparse_categorical_accuracy function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```

With this correction, the function first converts y_true to a one-hot encoded tensor by using K.argmax, and then compares it with the predictions in y_pred by checking for equality.
