Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function is with the use of K.cast to cast the result of the comparison to a float type. This might not be the correct approach to calculate the sparse_categorical_accuracy.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the casting of the result using K.cast is not properly handled. This can lead to incorrect calculation of the sparse categorical accuracy.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The correct approach to calculate sparse categorical accuracy involves a different method for comparison and casting. One approach is to use K.equal to compare the indices of the maximum values of y_true and y_pred directly. Then, the result can simply be cast to a float type.

Corrected code:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```
