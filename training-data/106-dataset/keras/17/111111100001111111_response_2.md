The potential error in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is that it is using `K.max` to find the maximum value in `y_true`, which is a 1D tensor. However, `K.max` is used for finding the maximum value across a specified axis, which is not necessary in this context.

As a result, the current implementation would compare the maximum value of `y_true` with the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`, which is not the correct approach for calculating sparse categorical accuracy.

To fix this bug, we should compare the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred` directly.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)),
                  K.floatx())
```

With this corrected implementation, the function now correctly compares the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, and returns the sparse categorical accuracy as expected.
