The test case `test_sparse_categorical_accuracy_correctness` is testing the correctness of the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The function takes `y_true` and `y_pred` as input, compares them, and returns the accuracy. The test case checks whether the accuracy obtained from `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is equal to the accuracy obtained from `categorical_accuracy` function.

The error message shows that the assertion fails, indicating that the accuracy calculated using `sparse_categorical_accuracy` is not equal to the accuracy obtained using `categorical_accuracy`.

The potential error location in the provided function is the comparison between `y_true` and `y_pred`.

The bug occurs because the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is comparing the maximum value of `y_true` with the index corresponding to the maximum value in `y_pred`. This logic does not correctly calculate the categorical accuracy.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function to perform a proper comparison between the ground truth and the predicted values using `K.equal`, and then calculate the mean over the last axis to get the accuracy.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())))
```
