Potential error location: The potential error location is in the comparison of y_true and y_pred within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison between y_true and y_pred does not yield the desired output due to incorrect use of K.max and K.argmax functions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use `tf.math.argmax` instead of `K.argmax` to get the indices of the maximum values along the last axis of y_pred.
- Use `tf.math.reduce_max` instead of `K.max` to get the maximum values along the last axis of y_true.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_17/keras/metrics.py

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(
        K.equal(
            K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
            K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
        ), K.floatx()
    )
```
