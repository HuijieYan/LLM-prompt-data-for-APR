The error occurs because the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function is incorrectly comparing `y_true` and `y_pred`. The `y_true` input is expected to be the one-hot encoded version of the true labels, but in the provided code, it's directly comparing the maximum value of `y_true` (which isn't the intended use) with the argmax of `y_pred`.

To fix the bug, the correct way to implement the sparse categorical accuracy is to compare the argmax of `y_true` with the argmax of `y_pred`. Also, since the function provided is using Keras backend functions (K), it seems like it's meant to be used within a Keras model. The correct way to calculate sparse categorical accuracy within Keras is to use the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function provided by Keras.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred)
```

This correction uses the Keras backend's `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function, which is the recommended way to calculate sparse categorical accuracy within Keras.
