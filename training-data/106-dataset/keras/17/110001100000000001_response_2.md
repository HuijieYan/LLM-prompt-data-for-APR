Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the comparison of y_true with y_pred. The K.max function is used on y_true, which doesn't make sense for categorical accuracy, and the K.cast function is used on the result, which may not be necessary.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the original function is trying to calculate the sparse categorical accuracy incorrectly by using the K.max function on y_true, which is incorrect for this use case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the usage of K.max and adjust the comparison logic to correctly calculate sparse categorical accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.floatx()),
                          K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
                  K.floatx())
```
