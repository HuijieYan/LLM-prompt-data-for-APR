The error seems to be occurring within the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The function is using the `K.max` method to find the maximum value along axis -1 for `y_true`, but it should actually be finding the index of the maximum value. The `K.equal` method is then used to check if the maximum index value in `y_true` is equal to the index of the maximum value in `y_pred`.

The bug is occurring because the `K.max` method is being misused. It should return the index of the maximum value, not the value itself. This leads to incorrect comparisons in the `K.equal` method.

To fix the bug, the `argmax` method should be used to find the index of the maximum value along axis -1 for both `y_true` and `y_pred`. Then, these indices should be compared using the `equal` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_indices = K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return K.cast(K.equal(true_indices, pred_indices), K.floatx())
```
