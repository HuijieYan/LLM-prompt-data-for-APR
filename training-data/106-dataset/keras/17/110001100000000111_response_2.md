The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the inputs are non-integer values.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the input values are probabilities (float values) instead of class labels (integer values).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to account for the input values being probabilities. We should first convert the probabilities to class labels by taking the argmax of the predictions. Then, we can compare the class labels with the true labels to calculate the accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the sparse_categorical_accuracy function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_class = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_true, y_pred_class), tf.float32))
```
