The error occurs in the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The function compares the maximum value in `y_true` with the index of the maximum value in `y_pred` and then casts it to the data type `K.floatx()`.

The bug occurred because the current implementation does not properly calculate the sparse categorical accuracy. The function only checks if the index of the maximum value in `y_pred` matches the maximum value in `y_true`, which is incorrect. It should compare the actual values between `y_true` and `y_pred` to calculate accuracy. Additionally, the return value should be a mean over all the instances in the batch, as this is a metric for the entire batch, not for individual instances.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. We should use `K.equal` to compare the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, and then use `K.mean` to calculate the mean accuracy over the batch.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                          K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)))
```

This corrected implementation compares the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, and then calculates the mean accuracy over the batch.
