Potential Error Location: The potential error location is within the K.cast and K.equal functions in the sparse_categorical_accuracy function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect usage of the K.cast and K.equal functions. The K.cast function is being used incorrectly, and the comparison within K.equal may not be performing as intended.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the K.cast function is used properly to cast the data types and the K.equal function is used to compare the values appropriately.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected function
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, K.floatx())
    y_pred = K.cast(y_pred, K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)), K.floatx())
```
