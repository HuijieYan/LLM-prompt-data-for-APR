The error is occurring due to the incorrect implementation of the `sparse_categorical_accuracy` function. The bug is likely in the logic of comparing `y_true` and `y_pred` to calculate the accuracy.

The bug is occurring in the line:
```python
return K.cast(K.equal(K.max(y_true, axis=-1),
                      K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())),
              K.floatx())
```

The bug is that directly comparing `y_true` and `y_pred` in this manner will not give a valid accuracy value. The correct approach would be to convert `y_true` to one-hot encoding and then compare it with `y_pred`.

To fix this issue, the corrected function to calculate sparse categorical accuracy is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, K.floatx())
    y_pred = K.cast(y_pred, K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1),
                         K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)), K.floatx())
```

The corrected function now converts `y_true` and `y_pred` to the same data type and then checks the equality of their argmax values. This correctly accounts for sparse categorical accuracy.
