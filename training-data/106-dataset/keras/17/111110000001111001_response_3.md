Potential error location: The problematic line is `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. This line seems to be trying to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`, but `y_true` is a tensor, not a valid argument for the `K.max()` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `K.max()` function is being used incorrectly. Also, the comparison using `K.equal()` is not being done correctly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `tf.reduce_max()` instead of `K.max()` to find the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`.
2. Use `tf.equal()` instead of `K.equal()` for the comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    max_y_true = tf.reduce_max(y_true, axis=-1)
    pred_argmax = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1)
    return tf.cast(tf.equal(max_y_true, tf.cast(pred_argmax, tf.float32)), tf.float32)
```
