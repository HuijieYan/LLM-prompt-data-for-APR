The test case compares the results of two different accuracy metrics (sparse_categorical_accuracy and categorical_accuracy) by using the np.allclose function. The error message indicates that the two arrays being compared are not equal, leading to the AssertionError.

The potential error in the problematic function "sparse_categorical_accuracy" lies in the incorrect use of max and argmax functions. The provided implementation is not properly handling sparse categorical accuracy calculation, as it is comparing the maximum value of y_true (which is not the predicted class label, rather it is a one-hot encoded representation) with the argmax of y_pred.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect comparison of y_true and y_pred values. To fix this bug, we should compare the predicted class label (argmax of y_pred) with the true class label (y_true). Additionally, the conversion of y_true to one-hot encoding should be applied within the function rather than being the responsibility of the user.

The corrected code for the sparse_categorical_accuracy function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred = K.cast(K.argmax(y_pred, axis=-1), K.floatx())
    return K.cast(K.equal(y_true, y_pred), K.floatx())
```
