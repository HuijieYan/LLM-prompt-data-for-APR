Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `weighted_masked_objective` function, specifically in the `weighted` function where the calculation of `score_array` may be causing the NaN result.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be happening due to improper handling of the `weights` and `mask` tensors that are passed to the `weighted` function. It is possible that the multiplication and division operations with these tensors are causing the unexpected result, leading to a NaN value for the loss.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the shapes of the `weights` and `mask` tensors and ensure they are compatible with the `score_array` to avoid any shape-related errors.
2. Verify the operations with the `weights` and `mask` tensors, and make sure that there are no division by zero or other invalid operations that can lead to NaN values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)
        
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        
        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```
