The error message indicates that the loss value calculated is returning a `nan` (not a number) instead of the expected 0 value. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculation of the loss within the `create_masking_model()` function.

The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is the calculation of the `score_array` and its handling when applying masking and sample weighting. The issue might be related to how the mask and weights are being used in the calculations.

The occurrence of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, leading to incorrect results in the calculation of the loss.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the mask and weights are properly applied to the `score_array` before calculating the final loss. Additionally, checking for edge cases where the weights or mask might be all zeros is important to avoid division by zero or incorrect calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
``` 

This corrected code ensures that the mask and weights are correctly applied to the `score_array` before returning the final loss value.
