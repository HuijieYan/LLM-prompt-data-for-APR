1. The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` is trying to assert that the loss calculated for an input of all zeros should be 0. However, the error message shows that the actual loss is `nan` (not a number), which is unexpected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `score_array` and handling of `mask` and `weights`.

3. The occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, leading to invalid calculations that result in a `nan` loss.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for edge cases where the mask or weights may cause invalid calculations (such as division by zero).
   - Ensuring that all operations on the `score_array` properly consider the mask and weights.
   - Using appropriate array operations to handle the mask and weights without introducing invalid values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            fn_output_shape = K.int_shape(fn(y_true, y_pred))
            mask = K.reshape(mask, (-1,)+((1,) * (len(fn_output_shape) - 1)))
            mask = K.repeat_elements(mask, fn_output_shape[1], axis=1)
            mask = K.repeat_elements(mask, fn_output_shape[2], axis=2)

        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

This corrected function takes into account the shapes of the `score_array` and the mask, and properly handles the mask and weights to avoid invalid calculations.
