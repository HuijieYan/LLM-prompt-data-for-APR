The issue here seems to be with the implementation of the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The function is supposed to wrap an objective function to support masking and sample-weighting. However, it seems that the implementation of the `weighted` function inside `weighted_masked_objective` is incomplete and causing incorrect results in tests.

The bug occurs because the `weighted` function is not properly applying the masking and sample-weighting to the `score_array`, resulting in an incorrect loss value and possibly leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `weighted` function should properly handle the masking and sample-weighting operations on the `score_array`. Additionally, the `weighted_masked_objective` function should be modified to correctly wrap the objective function and return the `weighted` function.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # apply mask to score_array
            score_array *= mask

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights

        return K.mean(score_array)  # Return the mean of the score_array

    return weighted  # Return the weighted function
```

With this corrected implementation, the `weighted_masked_objective` function wraps the objective function correctly and the `weighted` function applies masking and sample-weighting operations to the `score_array` as intended. This should address the issue and resolve the bug.
