The error message from the test function indicates that the loss value is NaN (Not a Number) instead of being 0 as expected.

After analyzing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the `weighted` function. When the mask is not None, a series of operations are applied to `score_array`, including multiplying by the mask and then dividing by the mean of the mask. The division by the mean of the mask can cause NaN values when the mask contains all zeros, resulting in the assertion error in the test function.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `weighted` function to handle the case when the mask is not None and consists of all zeros. One possible approach is to add a small epsilon value to the mean of the mask to avoid division by zero. Another approach could be to check if the mean of the mask is zero and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
