The error occurs in the calculation of the `score_array` in the `weighted` function. The problem is likely caused by an issue with the sample weighting when the weights are not None. Additionally, there is a possibility of division by zero, which results in a nan value for the loss.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the calculations where the sample weighting is applied and ensure that the division is handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # apply weights only if they are not all zeros
            if K.sum(weights) != 0:
                score_array *= weights
                score_array /= K.mean(weights)

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if the sum of the weights is not zero before applying the sample weighting. This prevents division by zero and the resulting nan values in the loss calculation.
