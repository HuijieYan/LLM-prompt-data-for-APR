The issue with the code is that the `weighted` function inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function is not correctly calculating the loss when using a mask or sample weights. This is resulting in a loss value of `nan` during testing instead of the expected value of 0.

The bug is likely occurring in the following section of the code:
```python
#  the loss per batch should be proportional
#  to the number of unmasked samples.
score_array /= K.mean(mask)

# apply sample weighting
if weights is not None:
    # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
    ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
    weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
    score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                         axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
    score_array *= weights
    score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
```

The `score_array` is being modified incorrectly in the above section, which is likely causing the loss to result in `nan` during testing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `weighted` function to correctly handle masking and sample weighting and return a valid loss value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # Apply mask to the score array
            score_array *= mask

        if weights is not None:
            # Apply sample weighting
            score_array *= K.cast(weights, K.floatx())

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

After making these changes, the `weighted` function correctly applies the mask and sample weights to the `score_array` and returns a valid loss value.
