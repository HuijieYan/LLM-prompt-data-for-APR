The error message suggests that the loss value is actually 'nan' (not a number) instead of the expected value of 0. This indicates that there is an issue with the loss calculation within the `weighted` function.

The potential error location is when the variable `score_array` is being calculated and manipulated. There might be an issue with the masking or sample weighting logic.

The bug is likely occurring because the logic for applying the mask and sample weights to the `score_array` is not implemented correctly. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the loss, resulting in a 'nan' value.

To fix this bug, the logic for applying the mask and sample weights to the `score_array` needs to be revised to ensure that it accurately represents the weighted and masked loss.

The corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function is as follows:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array = K.cast(mask, K.floatx()) * score_array
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            weights = K.cast(weights, K.floatx())
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(weights)

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the logic for applying the mask and sample weights to the `score_array` has been revised to ensure the correct calculation of the loss. Moreover, the operations and calculations are performed using the appropriate Keras backend functions to ensure consistency and compatibility.
