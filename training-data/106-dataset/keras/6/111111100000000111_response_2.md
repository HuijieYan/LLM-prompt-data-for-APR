Potential error location:
The `weighted_masked_objective` function is attempting to define a nested function `weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None)`, but it is not being used or returned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `weighted_masked_objective` function defines a nested function `weighted`, but it does not return this nested function. As a result, the `weighted` function is not accessible outside of `weighted_masked_objective`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `weighted_masked_objective` function should be modified to return the `weighted` function defined inside it. Then, when calling `weighted_masked_objective`, it should be assigned to a variable in order to use the returned `weighted` function.

Corrected code:
```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.
    
    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    
    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    """

        return None
