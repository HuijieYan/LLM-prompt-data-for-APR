The error message from the test function indicates that the loss computed by the model during training is resulting in a `nan` (not a number) instead of the expected value of 0.

The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is likely in the handling of masks and weights. It seems that there may be a problem with how the `mask` and `weights` are being used to modify the `score_array`. This could be leading to the computation of a `nan` value.

The occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, leading to invalid calculations and resulting in a `nan` loss value.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `mask` and `weights` are handled correctly in modifying the `score_array`. Additionally, it's important to handle edge cases where the `mask` or `weights` may not be valid or present.

Below is the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array = K.cast(score_array, K.floatx())  # Ensure score_array is of the same type as mask
            score_array = K.cast(score_array * mask, K.floatx())  # element-wise multiplication
            masked_samples = K.sum(mask)  # Count the number of unmasked samples
            masked_mean = K.mean(masked_samples)  # Obtain the mean of the mask
            score_array /= masked_mean  # Normalize the score by the mean of the mask

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            weights = K.cast(weights, K.floatx())
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array, axis=list(range(weight_ndim, K.ndim(score_array))))  # Reduce the score to the same ndim as the weights
            score_array *= weights  # Apply the weights
            weight_sum = K.sum(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))  # Sum of non-zero weights
            score_array /= weight_sum  # Normalize by the sum of non-zero weights

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `score_array` is cast to the same type as the `mask` to avoid issues with different types when performing operations. Additionally, we use K.sum() and K.mean() to calculate the sum of non-zero weights and the mean of the mask, respectively, in a more robust way. These changes should address the issues leading to the `nan` loss value.
