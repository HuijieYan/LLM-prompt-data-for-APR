The error message indicates that the `loss` value computed in the `model.train_on_batch` is returning `nan` instead of the expected value of `0`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the computation of the loss within the `weighted` function of the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

The potential error location within the `weighted` function is in the computation of `score_array`. It seems like the operations involving `mask` and `weights` are causing the issue.

The bug is most likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights. The computation involving the mask and weights may not be correctly applied to the `score_array`, leading to unexpected results, such as `nan`.

To fix the bug, the computation involving the mask and weights should be carefully handled to ensure that the operations are applied correctly and do not lead to `nan` values.

Here is the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            score_array = score_array * mask  # element-wise multiplication
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            score_array = score_array * weights  # element-wise multiplication
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        # The final return should be the mean of the score_array
        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

With these corrections, the `weighted_masked_objective` function now correctly handles the computation of the loss with sample-weighting and masking, which should address the `nan` issue in the `test_masking_is_all_zeros` test case.
