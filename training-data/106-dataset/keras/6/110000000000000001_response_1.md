The potential error in the provided function is that it incorrectly handles the calculation of the weighted and masked objective function. Additionally, there are issues with handling the dimensions and types of the input tensors.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the masking and sample-weighting of the objective function. There are also issues with handling the dimensions and types of the input tensors.

To fix the bug, I will modify the function to correctly handle the masking and sample-weighting of the objective function, and ensure that the dimensions and types of the input tensors are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # Compute the score using the provided objective function
        score = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        # Apply mask to the score if a mask is provided
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score *= mask

        # Apply sample weighting if weights are provided
        if weights is not None:
            score *= weights

        # Compute the weighted and masked mean of the score
        if mask is not None:
            score = K.mean(score) / K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))
        else:
            score = K.mean(score)

        return score

    return weighted
