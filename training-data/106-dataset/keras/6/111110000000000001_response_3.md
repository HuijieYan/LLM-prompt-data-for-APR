The potential error in the code is that the function is not handling the case where `fn` is None. This can lead to a 'NoneType' object is not callable error when the function is called with a None argument.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the `weighted_masked_objective` function to handle the case when `fn` is None and simply return None in that case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:  # Add a check for None
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        if fn is None:  # Add a check for None
            return None

        # Remaining code stays the same
        # ...

    return weighted
```
