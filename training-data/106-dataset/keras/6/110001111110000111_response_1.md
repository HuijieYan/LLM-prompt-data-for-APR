1. The test case is checking if the loss returned by the `model.train_on_batch` method is 0. However, the error message indicates that the loss is returned as `nan` (not a number) instead of 0.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the computation of the `score_array` within the `weighted` function.

3. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of weights and masks in the `weighted` function. The computation of `score_array` involves multiplication and division by the mask and weights, and these operations may result in `nan` values if not handled properly.

4. To fix the bug, the `weighted` function needs to accurately handle the mask and weights when computing the `score_array`. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the mask or weights are not provided.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `weighted` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights=None, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor (optional).
            mask: Mask tensor (optional).

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # compute score_array using the provided objective function
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # apply the mask to the score_array
            score_array = K.cast(mask, K.floatx()) * score_array

        if weights is not None:
            # apply sample weighting to the score_array
            score_array = K.cast(weights, K.floatx()) * score_array

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
