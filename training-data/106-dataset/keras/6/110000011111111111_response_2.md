The error is likely occurring due to a bug in the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The issue is that the `score_array` is being divided by the mean of the mask tensor, which can result in a division by zero leading to a `NaN` value.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to calculate the mean of the mask tensor only if the mask tensor is not None. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the weights tensor is not None, similar to how we handle the mask tensor.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            non_zero_mask = K.sum(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))
            score_array /= non_zero_mask

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array *= weights
            non_zero_weights = K.sum(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
            score_array /= non_zero_weights

        return K.mean(score_array)
    
    return weighted
```

With these modifications, the bug related to division by zero and the occurrence of `NaN` values should be fixed.
