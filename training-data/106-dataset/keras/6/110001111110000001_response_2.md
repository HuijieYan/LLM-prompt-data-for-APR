Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `weighted` function within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. It seems that the calculations for the `score_array` and `weights` are not handled correctly, leading to a possible division by zero or other arithmetic issues.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `score_array` and `weights` calculations. The code might not be properly handling the masking, weights, and their interactions with the `score_array`, leading to unexpected results and a possible division by zero.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of the mask, weights, and their interactions with the `score_array`.
2. Check for potential division by zero and handle it gracefully.
3. Verify that the dimensions and shapes of the tensors are compatible for the arithmetic operations performed in the `weighted` function.

Corrected Code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None
