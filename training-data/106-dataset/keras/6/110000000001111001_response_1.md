Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the function `weighted_masked_objective` where the `weighted` function is not properly returning the expected value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The issue arises because the `weighted` function is not properly modifying the `score_array` based on the provided `mask` and `weights`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `mask` and `weights` are not None before applying any modifications to `score_array`.
2. Ensure that the operations on `score_array` considering `mask` and `weights` are performed based on the correct logic.

Corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array, axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return fn(y_true, y_pred) * score_array

    return weighted
```
