Potential error location: 

The potential error in the function is in the calculation of the weighted and masked objective function. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

1. The calculation of the masked objective function might not be correct, as it needs to consider the mask and weights when calculating the final score.

2. The implementation of applying sample weighting also seems to be incorrect, as it requires proper handling of weights and their impact on the final score.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Consider the mask and weights when calculating the final score.
2. Properly handle the sample weighting by incorporating the weights into the calculation of the final score.

Corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss should be proportional to the number of unmasked samples.
