The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `weighted` function where the score_array is being manipulated. The error message from the test function indicates that the loss calculated is resulting in a `nan` (not a number) value instead of 0, which is expected.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect manipulation of the `mask` and `weights` in the `weighted` function, leading to the incorrect calculation of the loss.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the operations on the `score_array` consider the mask and weights properly and handle edge cases where the mask or weights might be zero. Additionally, the mean should be calculated using non-zero values to avoid division by zero and produce consistent results.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
    fn: The objective function to wrap,
        with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
    A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
        y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
        y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.

        mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
        Scalar tensor.
        """
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array = score_array * mask
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        if weights is not None:
            # Calculate the weights
            weights = K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx())
            score_array = score_array * weights
            score_array = K.mean(score_array) / K.mean(weights)

        return K.mean(score_array)
