The issue with the given `weighted_masked_objective` function is that it defines a nested `weighted` function inside it, which is ultimately returned. However, the variable `weighted` inside the `weighted_masked_objective` function is not the same as the one that is ultimately returned. This creates confusion and potential issues with the returned function.

The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` is failing with an assertion error. It seems that the loss calculation is resulting in a `NaN` (Not a Number) value, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is the nested `weighted` function. It is not being used as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the nested `weighted` function is defined but not utilized correctly within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. This leads to unexpected behavior when the function is called.

To fix the bug, it would be best to define the `weighted` function separately outside of the `weighted_masked_objective` function. Then, the `weighted` function can be utilized as intended within the `weighted_masked_objective` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_6/keras/engine/training_utils.py

def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
    """Wrapper function.

    # Arguments
        y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
        y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
        weights: Weights tensor.
        mask: Mask tensor.

    # Returns
        Scalar tensor.
    """
    # score_array has ndim >= 2
    score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
    if mask is not None:
        # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
        mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
        # mask should have the same shape as score_array
        score_array *= mask
        #  the loss per batch should be proportional
        #  to the number of unmasked samples.
        score_array /= K.mean(mask)

    # apply sample weighting
    if weights is not None:
        # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
        ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
        weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
        score_array = K.mean(score_array,
                             axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
        score_array *= weights
        score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
    return K.mean(score_array)

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        return weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the `weighted` function is defined separately from the `weighted_masked_objective` function and is utilized correctly within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. This should resolve the issue and prevent unexpected behavior when the function is called.
