The potential error location in the provided function is in the section where it applies sample weighting to the score_array. 

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the weights tensor and the mask tensor have different shapes, which can lead to dimensionality issues and incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weights and mask tensors have the same shape as the score_array before applying any operations.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            mask = K.expand_dims(mask, axis=-1)  # Add an axis to match score_array shape
            score_array *= mask
            # the loss per batch should be proportional
            # to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)
            
        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
