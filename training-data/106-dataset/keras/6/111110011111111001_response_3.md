Potential error location:
The issue is likely within the `weighted` function, specifically in the calculation of `score_array` and how the mask and weights are applied.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the mask and weights, which leads to NaN (Not a Number) results in the loss calculation. This can happen if the mask or weights are not properly applied or if there is a division by zero.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for division by zero when applying the mask or weights.
2. Ensure that the mask and weights have the correct shapes and are applied appropriately to the `score_array`.
3. Use conditional statements to handle different scenarios such as when the mask or weights are None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
