Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `weighted_masked_objective` function. The issue seems to be with the calculations involving the `score_array` and the masking and weighting operations.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect calculations in the `weighted` function. The operations involving the `score_array` and the mask and weights are not correctly implemented, resulting in the assertion error when testing the masking functionality.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the dimensions of the `score_array`, `mask`, and `weights` to ensure they are compatible for the intended operations.
2. Update the masking and weighting calculations to accurately apply the mask and weights to the `score_array`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array = score_array * mask  # Element-wise multiplication
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            score_array = score_array * weights  # Element-wise multiplication
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
