1. The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` is meant to test whether the loss is 0 when the input and output tensors are both zero. The error message indicates that the actual loss is `nan` instead of 0.

2. The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is in the handling of the mask and weights when calculating the loss.

3. The occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights, resulting in the loss calculation producing a `nan` value instead of the expected 0.

4. To fix the bug, the approach would be to properly handle the mask and weights, ensuring that their effects are correctly incorporated into the loss calculation.

5. Corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
