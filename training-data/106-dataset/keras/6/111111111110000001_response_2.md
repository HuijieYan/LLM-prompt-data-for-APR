1. Based on the error message from the test function, it appears that the loss value calculated is a `nan` (not a number) instead of the expected 0.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the `score_array`. There might be a problem with how `score_array` is being manipulated based on the mask and weights.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to improper handling of the mask and weights in the calculation of `score_array`, leading to the final loss value becoming a `nan`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the manipulation of `score_array` based on the mask and weights to ensure correct handling.
   - Verify that the dimensions of the mask and weights are compatible with `score_array` for proper element-wise operations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.
