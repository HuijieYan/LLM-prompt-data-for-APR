The issue with the provided code is that it is returning a function object of `weighted` without actually calling the `weighted_masked_objective` function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return weighted` statement.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `weighted_masked_objective` function is not being called correctly, and the returned value is not being assigned to a variable.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `weighted_masked_objective` function and assign the returned value to the `weighted` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array, axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted

weighted = weighted_masked_objective(fn)
```

Now the `weighted` function will be assigned the correct function object returned by the `weighted_masked_objective` function.
