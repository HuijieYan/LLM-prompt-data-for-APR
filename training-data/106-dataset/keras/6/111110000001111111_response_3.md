The buggy function `weighted_masked_objective` is taking an objective function `fn` as input and returns a wrapped function `weighted` which adds support for masking and sample-weighting to the objective function.

The issue with the function seems to be related to the fact that it is not using the `K` module correctly for tensor operations.

The bug occurs because the code is assuming that `K` is a global module and is attempting to call methods from it directly without importing it. This leads to a `NameError` where `K` is not defined.

To fix this bug, the `K` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the tensor operations within the `weighted` function need to be prefixed with `K.` to indicate that they are methods of the `K` module.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            #  the loss per batch should be proportional
            #  to the number of unmasked samples.
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)
            score_array = K.mean(score_array,

            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
