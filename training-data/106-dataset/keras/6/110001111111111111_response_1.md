The error occurs because the `score_array` calculation leads to a `nan` (Not a Number) value, which then propagates to the final `loss` variable in the test. This suggests a problem with the objective function or the masking function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation involving `score_array`. This is where the bug likely exists, as it could be leading to incorrect results and the presence of `nan` values.

The reason for the bug is that the calculation involving the `score_array` may not be handling the mask and weights properly, leading to incorrect and unexpected values, including `nan`.

To fix the bug, the weighted and masked objective function should be modified to correctly handle the mask and weights. This could involve adjusting the operations involving `score_array`, making sure they appropriately incorporate the mask and weights without leading to unexpected results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= mask / K.mean(mask)
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights / K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
