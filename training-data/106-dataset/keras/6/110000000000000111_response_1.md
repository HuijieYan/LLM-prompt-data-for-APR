Potential error location: The potential error is in the calculation of the sample-weighted objective function. The function currently has an issue where it is trying to calculate the weighted objective function but there are errors in the calculation related to masking and applying weights.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling the application of mask and weights correctly. The code is trying to perform operations on arrays without properly ensuring that the dimensions and shapes are compatible.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the dimensions and shapes of the arrays to ensure compatibility before performing operations.
2. Properly handle the masking and sample-weighting operations to avoid errors.

Corrected code:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # Get the score array from the objective function
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Apply mask to the score array
            score_array *= mask / (K.mean(mask) + K.epsilon())
        
        if weights is not None:
            # Apply sample weighting
            score_array *= weights / (K.mean(K.abs(weights)) + K.epsilon())
