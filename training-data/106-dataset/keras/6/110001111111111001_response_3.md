The error message indicates that the calculated loss value is not as expected, leading to a failed assertion. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the loss within the `weighted` function, which is a part of the larger `weighted_masked_objective` function.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations within the `weighted` function, specifically in the handling of the mask and weights. This is leading to unexpected loss values, resulting in the test failure.

To address this issue, the `weighted` function needs to be modified to ensure correct handling of the mask and weights and proper calculation of the loss.

Here's the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# modified function
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
    fn: The objective function to wrap,
        with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
    A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= mask

        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In this corrected code, the mask and weights are handled by simply multiplying them with the `score_array` obtained from the objective function `fn`. This should address the issue with the incorrect loss calculation and resolve the test failure.
