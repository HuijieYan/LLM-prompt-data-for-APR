The error occurs because the `weighted_masked_objective` function is not returning the correct function signature. The returned function is missing the `fn` parameter which is necessary for the objective function to work properly.

To fix this issue, the `weighted_masked_objective` function needs to be modified to return the `weighted` function with the correct signature that includes the `fn` parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_6/keras/engine/training_utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



# this is the corrected function
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # original implementation here

    return weighted
```

With this correction, the function will now return the correct `weighted` function with the correct signature, and the error in the test should be resolved.
