Potential error location: The issue is with the `weighted_masked_objective` function that is supposed to wrap an objective function with sample-weighting and masking support, but it's not doing so correctly.

Reasons for the bug: The `weighted_masked_objective` function is defining the `weighted` function inside itself, but it is not being used or returned correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Define the `weighted` function outside of the `weighted_masked_objective` function, and then return it at the end of the `weighted_masked_objective` function.
- Remove the `weighted` function and directly return the nested function inside `weighted_masked_objective`.

Corrected code:

```python
def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
    """Wrapper function.

    # Arguments
        y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
        y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.

        mask: Mask tensor.

    # Returns
        Scalar tensor.
    """
    # score_array has ndim >= 2
    score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
    if mask is not None:
        # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
        mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
        # mask should have the same shape as score_array
        score_array *= mask
        #  the loss per batch should be proportional
        #  to the number of unmasked samples.
        score_array /= K.mean(mask)

    # apply sample weighting
    if weights is not None:
        # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array
        ndim = K.ndim(score_array)
