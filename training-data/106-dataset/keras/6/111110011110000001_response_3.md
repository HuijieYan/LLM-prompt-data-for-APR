The error message indicates that the `loss` value calculated in the `train_on_batch` method is a `nan` (not-a-number) instead of 0, which is the expected result.

The potential error location could be in the `weighted_masked_objective` function, specifically in the calculation of the `score_array` and its subsequent manipulation with the mask and weights.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect manipulation of the `score_array` with the mask and weights, which results in a `nan` value being returned as the loss.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the manipulation of the `score_array` with the mask and weights is done correctly. Additionally, proper handling of edge cases, such as when the mask or weights are not provided, should also be considered.

Here's the corrected version of the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights=None, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor (optional).
            mask: Mask tensor (optional).

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # Calculate score_array using the provided objective function
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # Apply mask to score_array
            score_array = score_array * mask
            # Adjust the score based on the number of unmasked samples
            score_array = score_array / K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            # Apply sample weighting
            score_array = score_array * weights
            # Normalize the score by the number of non-zero weights
            score_array = score_array / K.sum(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))

        return K.mean(score_array)

    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the manipulation of the `score_array` with the mask and weights has been modified to ensure correct handling of the mask and weights. Additionally, the handling of optional `weights` and `mask` parameters has been improved to handle edge cases more robustly.
