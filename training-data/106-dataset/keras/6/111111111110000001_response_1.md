1. The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` seems to be checking if the loss calculated by the `model.train_on_batch` method is equal to 0. However, the error message indicates that the assertion fails with the error `assert nan == 0`, suggesting that the loss value calculated is not 0 but instead a NaN.

2. The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is likely the calculation of `score_array`. There might be an issue with how the score is being calculated, or how the mask and weights are being applied to it.

3. The occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the mask and weights when calculating the loss, leading to a NaN value as a result.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the mask and weights are properly applied to the `score_array`, and that the calculations are handled in a way that prevents NaN values.

5. Corrected code for the `weighted_masked_objective` function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        # score_array has ndim >= 2
        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)

        if mask is not None:
            # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in Theano
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())
            # mask should have the same shape as score_array
            score_array *= mask
            # adjust the loss to account for the masked samples
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(mask, 0), K.floatx()))

        # apply sample weighting
        if weights is not None:
            score_array *= weights
            # adjust the loss to account for the weighted samples
            score_array /= K.mean(K.abs(weights))

        return K.mean(score_array)
    return weighted
```

In the corrected code, the adjustments to the loss calculation based on masks and weights are more appropriately handled, which should prevent the occurrence of NaN values and address the bug.
