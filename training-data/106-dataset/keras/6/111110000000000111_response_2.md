The potential error in the provided function is that the weighted function is not correctly applying the sample weighting and mask to the score_array.

The bug occurs because the mask is not being used to mask the score_array properly and the sample weighting is not being applied correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mask is properly applied to the score_array and that the sample weights are appropriately used to adjust the weighted score_array.

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.
