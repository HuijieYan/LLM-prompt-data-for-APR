1. The test case `test_masking_is_all_zeros` is checking if the loss is 0 after training on a batch of data. However, the test is failing because the loss is returning as `nan` instead of 0.

2. The potential error location within the `weighted_masked_objective` function is the calculation of the score array. Specifically, the application of weights and masking seems to be causing the issue.

3. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the weights and mask tensors. It seems that the calculations involving weights and mask are leading to non-numeric values, resulting in a loss of `nan`.

4. To fix the bug, the weighted and mask tensors need to be handled properly. This involves ensuring the dimensions of the tensors are compatible and handling any potential division by zero errors. Additionally, there needs to be proper handling of the mask and zero weights to avoid numerical issues.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def weighted_masked_objective(fn):
    """Adds support for masking and sample-weighting to an objective function.

    It transforms an objective function `fn(y_true, y_pred)`
    into a sample-weighted, cost-masked objective function
    `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.

    # Arguments
        fn: The objective function to wrap,
            with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred)`.

    # Returns
        A function with signature `fn(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask)`.
    """
    if fn is None:
        return None

    def weighted(y_true, y_pred, weights, mask=None):
        """Wrapper function.

        # Arguments
            y_true: `y_true` argument of `fn`.
            y_pred: `y_pred` argument of `fn`.
            weights: Weights tensor.
            mask: Mask tensor.

        # Returns
            Scalar tensor.
        """
        if mask is not None:
            mask = K.cast(mask, K.floatx())

        score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        if mask is not None:
            score_array *= mask
            score_array /= K.mean(mask)

        if weights is not None:
            weights = K.cast(weights, K.floatx())
            score_array *= weights
            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))
