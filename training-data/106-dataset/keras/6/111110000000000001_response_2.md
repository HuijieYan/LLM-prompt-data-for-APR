Potential error location: The error might be in the line `score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))` where the division is attempted by the mean of `K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx())`. This line is attempting to calculate the mean of a boolean tensor, which may lead to unexpected results.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `K.not_equal(weights, 0)` creates a boolean tensor, and then taking the mean of this tensor may not produce the expected result.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of taking the mean of a boolean tensor, we could calculate the sum of non-zero elements in the weights tensor and then divide the `score_array` by this sum.
