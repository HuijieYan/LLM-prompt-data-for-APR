The error message indicates a TypeError occurring at line `if (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target)` where the error is `<` not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType'.

The potential error location is the comparison `current < self.target` within the `update` function. The error is occurring because `self.target` is set to `None` if it is unknown, and the comparison is between an integer value `current` and `NoneType` resulting from `self.target` being `None`.

The bug occurs because the comparison operation between `current` and `self.target` includes a `NoneType` value when `self.target` is not provided, leading to a TypeError.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a conditional check before the comparison to handle the case when `self.target` is `None`. If `self.target` is `None`, the comparison can be skipped to prevent the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """
    Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far), current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    now = time.time()
    info = ' - %.0fs' % (now - self.start)
    if self.target is not None:  # Add conditional check for self.target
        if self.verbose == 1:
            if (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target):
                return
            # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

By adding a conditional check for `self.target` before the comparison, the corrected code should prevent the TypeError caused by the comparison involving the `NoneType`.
