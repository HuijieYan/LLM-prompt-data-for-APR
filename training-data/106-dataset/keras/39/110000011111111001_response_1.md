The error occurs because the 'target' attribute is set to None when initializing the ProgBar object, and the comparison operation '<' is applied to it within the update method. This causes a TypeError since the comparison is not supported between an integer and a NoneType.

To fix this bug, the 'target' attribute should be checked for None within the update method, and a default value should be assigned if it is None.

Here's the corrected update method:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                  current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    now = time.time()
    info = ' - %.0fs' % (now - self.start)
    if self.verbose == 1:
        if self.target is not None and (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target):
            return
    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

By adding the condition `if self.target is not None` before the comparison operation, we ensure that the comparison is only performed when 'target' is not None, resolving the TypeError.
