The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the comparison of an integer and a `NoneType`. This occurs at the line `current < self.target` in the `update` function of the `Progbar` class.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement of the `update` function: `if (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target):`.

The bug occurs because the `self.target` variable is assigned with the value `None` for the progress bar, and when attempting to compare it with `current`, which is an integer, a `TypeError` is raised.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be adjusted to handle the case where `self.target` is `None`. This can be achieved by explicitly handling the case where `self.target` is `None` to avoid comparing it with an integer, as shown in the corrected code below.

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    # (previous code remains unchanged)

    # handle the case where self.target is None
    if self.target is not None and (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and current < self.target):
        return
    # (remaining code remains unchanged)
```
