There was an issue with updating the averages of the value in the buggy function. The issue was mostly occurring due to the incorrect handling of sum_values and unique_values. The updates weren't being processed correctly, and the variables weren't being maintained accurately. 

Possible Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize `sum_values` outside of the update method and use it as an attribute of self.
2. Use a conditional check to initialize sum_values and unique_values if they don't exist in the update function. 
3. Ensure proper update of sum_values with the new values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time
import numpy as np

class Progbar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sum_values = {}
        self.unique_values = []  # Initialize as empty list initially

    def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
        """
        Updates the progress bar.

        # Arguments
            current: Index of current step.
            values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
                The progress bar will display averages for these values.
            force: Whether to force visual progress update.
        """
        values = values or []
        if not self.sum_values:  # Initialize sum_values and unique_values
            for k, v in values:
                self.sum_values[k] = [v * current, current]
                self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            for k, v in values:
                if k not in self.sum_values:
                    self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far), current - self.seen_so_far]
                    self.unique_values.append(k)
                else:
                    self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
                    self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
        self.seen_so_far = current

        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected code makes sure to initialize sum_values and unique_values as empty dictionary and list respectively, if they are found to be empty when adding new values. It also correctly updates the sum_values with new values based on their existence.
