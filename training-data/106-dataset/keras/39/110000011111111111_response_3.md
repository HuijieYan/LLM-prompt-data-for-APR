The error occurs because the `update` method is trying to compare `current` with `self.target`, but `self.target` is set to `None` when the `Progbar` object is initialized with `Progbar(None)`.

To fix the issue, `self.target` should be checked for `None` before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far),
                                  current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    if self.target is not None and current < self.target:  # Check for None before comparison
        now = time.time()
        info = ' - %.0fs' % (now - self.start)
        if self.verbose == 1:
            if (not force and (now - self.last_update) < self.interval and
                    current < self.target):
                return
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

With this modification, the comparison between `current` and `self.target` is only performed when `self.target` is not `None`, which resolves the `TypeError` that was previously raised.
