The error occurs in the for loop where `values` are unpacked into `k` and `v`. This loop is intended to update the values in the `sum_values` dictionary using the `current` index. The bug seems to be related to the insertion and retrieval of values from the `sum_values` dictionary.

The sum_values dictionary is expected to store the cumulative sum and count of the values seen so far for each key.

The bug occurs due to incorrect calculations for updating the sum_values dictionary, leading to incorrect averages and visual progress updates.

To fix the bug, the approach should include:
1. Initialize `sum_values` and `unique_values` as empty dict and list, respectively.
2. Update the values correctly within the `sum_values` dictionary, accounting for the cumulative sum and count of the values for each key.
3. Calculate the averages of the summed values at the end before updating the progress bar visually.

Here is the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
        values = values or []
        for k, v in values:
            if k not in self.sum_values:
                self.sum_values[k] = [v, 1]  # Initialize value and count
                self.unique_values.append(k)
            else:
                self.sum_values[k][0] += v  # Add value to the sum
                self.sum_values[k][1] += 1  # Increment the count
        
        self.seen_so_far = current
        
        # Rest of the method remains unchanged
```
