Potential Error Location:
The issue in the `update` function is likely to be caused by the calculation of averages for the given values. 

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of averages in the `update` function. There is a recurring loop that calculates the averages for the given values, but it appears to be incorrectly computing the averages due to the sum_values dictionary which is not correctly updating.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the sum_values dictionary is being correctly updated with the values and their corresponding counts.
2. Correct the calculation of averages for the given values based on the updated sum_values dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v, 1]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v
            self.sum_values[k][1] += 1
    self.seen_so_far = current

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
