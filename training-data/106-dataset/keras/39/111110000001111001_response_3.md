The buggy function `update` in the `Progbar` class is attempting to update the progress bar based on the `current` step and `values`. The function also has additional logic to handle printing the progress bar and other relevant information. The error typically occurs during the update of the progress bar and the information display.

The potential error location is identified to be the part of the code where the progress bar is updated based on `current` and `values`. The issue arises when the `values` are processed within the for loop. This is where the function is updating the `self.sum_values` and `self.unique_values` based on the incoming `values`.

One possible cause of the error is that the `values` might not be in the expected format. The `values` parameter is specified as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a value for the last step. However, the provided test cases send arrays instead of lists of tuples, resulting in errors during processing.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `values` parameter is in the correct format, i.e., a list of tuples. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the `values` may be None or an empty list. This will prevent the function from encountering unintended behavior during execution.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method to handle these cases:

```python
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    values = values or []
    if not isinstance(values, list) or not all(isinstance(v, tuple) for v in values):
        raise ValueError("Values should be a list of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).")

    for k, v in values:
        if k not in self.sum_values:
            self.sum_values[k] = [v * (current - self.seen_so_far), current - self.seen_so_far]
            self.unique_values.append(k)
        else:
            self.sum_values[k][0] += v * (current - self.seen_so_far)
            self.sum_values[k][1] += (current - self.seen_so_far)
    self.seen_so_far = current

    # ... (omitted code)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
With this correction, the code will handle cases where `values` are not in the expected format and also handle cases where `values` might be None or an empty list.
