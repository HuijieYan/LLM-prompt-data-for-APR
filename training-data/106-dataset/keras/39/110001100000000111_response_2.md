Potential error location: The error may be due to the fact that the function is not properly accounting for missing imports and dependencies such as np, time, and sys.

Reason for the bug: The function is using np, time, and sys without importing them, which will cause NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the required modules at the beginning of the file to resolve the NameError.
2. To prevent future occurrences of similar bugs, review all function dependencies and ensure that they are properly imported.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import sys

# this is the corrected function
def update(self, current, values=None, force=False):
    """Updates the progress bar.

    # Arguments
        current: Index of current step.
        values: List of tuples (name, value_for_last_step).
            The progress bar will display averages for these values.
        force: Whether to force visual progress update.
    """
    # rest of the function remains the same
```
