The error message indicates that the "in_top_k" function is receiving input shapes that are not compatible. The input shapes are [2,3], [], [], where they should be [2,3] for predictions, [2] for targets, and the parameter k as an integer. This is causing the "InTopKV2" operation to fail due to the input shapes being incorrect.

The bug is likely occurring in the "sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy" function when calling the "K.in_top_k" function. This is because the max of y_true is being casted as 'int32' and returned as a scalar, which is causing issues with the "in_top_k" function.

The buggy function needs to be fixed to ensure that the shapes of the input tensors are compatible with the "in_top_k" function. The issue can be addressed by restructuring the computation to ensure that the input shapes and types for the "in_top_k" function match its expected input format.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, y_true_indices, k), axis=-1)
```
