The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is likely due to the incorrect use of the `K.max` function to determine the maximum value of the true labels. This is causing an issue in the comparison between the true labels and the predicted labels, leading to incorrect accuracy calculations for sparse categorical accuracy.

To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the true labels directly with the predicted labels without using the `K.max` function. Additionally, we should also check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable to handle both cases where the shape of `y_true` can be (num_samples, 1) or (num_samples).

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = K.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
This corrected function first checks the shape of `y_true` and squeezes it if the last dimension is 1. Then it compares `y_true` directly with `y_pred` to calculate the top k categorical accuracy for sparse labels.
