The bug in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function occurs because the code assumes the shape of `y_true` to always be `(num_samples, 1)`, leading to incorrect output when the shape is actually `(num_samples,)`. Additionally, the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function also has the same issue.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if the shape is `(num_samples, 1)`. This will ensure that the function works correctly for both shapes of `y_true`.

The corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function is as follows:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if len(y_true.shape) == 2 and y_true.shape[1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=1)
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle both shapes of `y_true` and produce the expected output.
