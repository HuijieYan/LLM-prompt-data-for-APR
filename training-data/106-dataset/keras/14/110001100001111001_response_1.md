The potential error in the buggy function lies in the use of `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)`. The function `K.max()` is used to compute the maximum value along a specified axis. However, the `y_true` tensor is already expected to be one-hot encoded, so taking the maximum value along the last axis doesn't make sense.

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` operation is not compatible with the expected input of one-hot encoded `y_true` values. The code should be modified to use `argmax` instead of `max` to get the indices of the maximum value along the last axis of `y_true`.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k),
                  axis=-1)
```
