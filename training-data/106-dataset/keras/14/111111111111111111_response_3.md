The bug is occurring in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function in the `keras/metrics.py` file. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the inputs, leading to a `tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError`.

The bug is caused by the assumption in the existing code that the shape of `y_true` is always `(num_samples, 1)`, leading to incorrect output. Instead, the code should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze it if applicable.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function to include logic to handle the shape of `y_true` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    # Check the shape of y_true and squeeze if applicable
    if K.int_shape(y_true)[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)

    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we check the shape of `y_true` and use `tf.squeeze` to remove dimensions of size 1 if necessary. This ensures that the function handles both `(num_samples, 1)` and `(num_samples,)` shapes properly.
