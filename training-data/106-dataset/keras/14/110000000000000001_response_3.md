Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the K.in_top_k function, where the dimensions of y_true and y_pred are not in the correct format.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the K.in_top_k function expects y_true and y_pred to be of the same shape, which is not the case in the provided function.

Approach for fixing the bug:
We need to reshape y_true to match the shape of y_pred before using the K.in_top_k function.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.one_hot(K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1])
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), k), axis=-1)
```
