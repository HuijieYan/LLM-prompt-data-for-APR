The error occurs in the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function when calling `K.in_top_k`. The error message indicates that the input shapes are not compatible with the operation, specifically, the shape must be rank 1 but is rank 0.

The bug occurs because the `K.max` function returns a tensor with reduced rank compared to the `y_true` tensor. This causes the `K.cast` function to generate an empty tensor, leading to the error when calling `K.in_top_k`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to first find the indices of the top k elements in `y_pred` and then compare those indices with the corresponding indices in `y_true`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true_indices = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1)
    y_pred_top_k = tf.nn.top_k(y_pred, k)
    y_pred_indices = y_pred_top_k.indices
    matches = tf.equal(tf.expand_dims(y_true_indices, axis=-1), y_pred_indices)
    top_k_match = tf.reduce_any(matches, axis=-1)
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(top_k_match, tf.float32))
```

In this corrected function, we first extract the indices of the maximum value in `y_true` using `tf.argmax`. Then, we find the top k elements in `y_pred` using `tf.nn.top_k` and extract their indices. After that, we compare the indices of `y_true` with the top k indices of `y_pred` and calculate the mean of the matches. This approach aligns with the intended functionality of the function and should resolve the error.
