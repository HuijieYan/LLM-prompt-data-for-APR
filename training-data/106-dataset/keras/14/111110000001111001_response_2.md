Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the calculation of the sparse top k categorical accuracy using Keras backend operations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by using the Keras backend operations incorrectly, leading to an error in the calculation of the sparse top k categorical accuracy.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use the appropriate Keras backend operations to calculate the sparse top k categorical accuracy.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.cast(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), K.floatx()))
```
