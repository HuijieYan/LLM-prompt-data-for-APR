The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `InTopKV2` operation input shapes: [2,3], [], []. This likely means that the shape of `y_pred` or `y_true` isn't being correctly handled by the `in_top_k` function.

The bug occurs because the input shapes are not compatible with the `InTopKV2` operation. The input shapes should be [batch_size, num_classes] for `y_pred` and [batch_size] for `y_true`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the shapes of `y_pred` and `y_true` are appropriate for the `InTopKV2` operation. This may involve reshaping the input variables to the expected shape.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    y_true = K.flatten(y_true)
    y_pred = K.reshape(y_pred, (-1, K.int_shape(y_pred)[-1]))
    
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we flatten `y_true` to ensure that it is the correct shape for input to `in_top_k`, and we reshape `y_pred` to ensure the appropriate shape as well. Then, we use K.in_top_k to compute the top k categorical accuracy.
