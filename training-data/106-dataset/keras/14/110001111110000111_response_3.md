The error message indicates that there is an issue with the input shapes in the function `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy`. It seems that the function assumes the shape of `y_true` to be `(num_samples, 1)` and reduces in the last dimension, leading to incorrect output. The function should check the shape of `y_true` and squeeze if applicable.

The bug exists in the assumption of the shape of `y_true` and the reduction in the last dimension. This causes the function to fail when the shape of `y_true` is not equal to `(num_samples, 1)`.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle different shapes of `y_true` appropriately. It should check the shape of `y_true` and adjust the computation accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function:

```python
def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    if y_true.shape[-1] == 1:
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=-1)  # Squeeze the last dimension if present
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(y_true, 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the shape of `y_true` has a single element in the last dimension. If so, we squeeze the tensor using `tf.squeeze` to remove the singleton dimension, so that it becomes compatible with the comparison operation inside `K.in_top_k`. This correction ensures that the function handles different shapes of `y_true` appropriately and does not assume a specific shape.
