The error occurs at the `in_top_k` function call inside the `sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy` function. The error message indicates that the shape of the inputs is causing an issue, specifically the shape of `y_true`. The `in_top_k` function expects the targets to have a rank of 1, but the provided input has a rank of 0.

The bug occurs because the `K.max(y_true, axis=-1)` command returns the maximum value along axis -1, which results in a lower rank tensor than expected by the `in_top_k` function.

To fix this bug, you can use the `K.argmax` function to get the indices of the maximum values in `y_true` instead of `K.max`. Then, you can cast those indices to the 'int32' data type before passing them to `K.in_top_k`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from keras import backend as K

def sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k=5):
    return K.mean(K.in_top_k(y_pred, K.cast(K.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), 'int32'), k), axis=-1)
```
