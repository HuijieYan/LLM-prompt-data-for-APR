The potential error location within the `add` method is that it is not handling the case where the layer being added is a `Sequential` or `Model` instance.

The bug likely occurs because when a `Sequential` or `Model` instance is added, the method is not correctly inferring the input shape and data type. This leads to issues with building the model.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `add` method to handle the case where a `Sequential` or `Model` instance is added by checking for these cases and obtaining the input shape and data type from these instances.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if isinstance(layer, (Sequential, Model)):
        # If the layer is a Sequential or Model instance, obtain the input shape and data type
        if not layer.inputs or not layer.outputs:  # Ensure that the Sequential or Model instance has inputs and outputs
            raise ValueError("The layer argument does not know its input shape or has no output tensors.")
        inputs = layer.inputs
        outputs = layer.outputs
        self.inputs = inputs
        self.outputs = outputs
    elif isinstance(layer, Layer):
        # If the layer is a standard Layer instance
        if not hasattr(layer, '_inbound_nodes') or not layer._inbound_nodes:
            raise ValueError("The layer argument does not have inbound nodes.")
        input_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[-1].input_tensors
        output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors
        if len(output_tensors) != 1:
            raise ValueError("The layer argument has multiple output tensors.")
        self.outputs = output_tensors
        self.inputs = input_tensors
    else:
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer or Sequential. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self._layers:
        self.built = False
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

This corrected code handles the case where a `Sequential` or `Model` instance is added and obtains the input shape and data type from these instances. Additionally, it also correctly handles the case where a standard Layer instance is added.
