The bug in the `add` method of the `Sequential` class is that it doesn't handle adding a nested Sequential model correctly. The error occurs when trying to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute of the `first_layer`, which is a Dense layer object and does not have this attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `add` method to properly handle nested Sequential models. Specifically, when adding a Sequential model, we should iterate through its layers to obtain the first non-Sequential layer and use its attributes to set up the input shape and data type for the nested model.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method of the `Sequential` class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, Layer):
        if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
            # Iterate through the nested Sequential model's layers
            nested_first_layer = layer.layers[0]
            while isinstance(nested_first_layer, Sequential):
                nested_first_layer = nested_first_layer.layers[0]

            if not isinstance(nested_first_layer, InputLayer):
                # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
                batch_shape = nested_first_layer.batch_input_shape
                dtype = nested_first_layer.dtype

                # Instantiate the input layer.
                x = Input(
                    batch_shape=batch_shape,
                    dtype=dtype,
                    name=layer.name + '_input')
                # This will build the current layer
                # and create the node connecting the current layer
                # to the input layer we just created.
                layer(x)
                self._layers.append(layer)
            else:
                # Corner case where the user passes an InputLayer via `add`.
                assert len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) == 1
                self._layers.append(layer)
        else:
            self.built = False
            self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
```

This corrected method now properly handles adding a nested Sequential model by iterating through its layers to find the first non-Sequential layer and use its attributes to set up the input shape and data type for the nested model.
