The error message is indicating an AttributeError related to 'batch_input_shape' while trying to access this attribute from a 'Dense' object. This error occurs during the execution of the 'test_nested_sequential_deferred_build' test case when the 'inner_model' is added to the 'model'.

The potential error location within the problematic add function is the section that attempts to access 'batch_input_shape' directly from the 'layer' object, assuming that 'layer' is an instance of 'Model' or 'Sequential'. However, this assumption is not valid for the 'Dense' layer.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect assumption that any layer instance being added will have the 'batch_input_shape' attribute. This assumption is incorrect because not all layers have this attribute, especially primitive layers like 'Dense'.

To fix the bug, a more generic approach is needed to handle different types of layers and their attributes. One possible approach is to use a conditional check to verify if the 'layer' is an instance of 'Model' or 'Sequential' and then access 'batch_input_shape' accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
