The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` creates an inner model and adds dense layers to it. Then, it creates another model and attempts to add the inner model to it as a layer.

The error message indicates that the `Dense` object (the layer being added to the inner model) has no attribute `batch_input_shape`, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access it in the `build` function.

The reason for this bug is that the inner model expects the layers to have `batch_input_shape` set in order to build the model. However, the `Dense` layer being added does not have this attribute, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `add` function in the `Sequential` class to handle layers that do not have a `batch_input_shape` attribute properly. One approach is to create a default batch shape if it's not available, and another approach could be to build the model lazily if the input shape and dtype are not known at the time of addition.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape') or not layer.batch_input_shape:
        # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape, build the model lazily
        self.built = False
    else:
        # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
        batch_shape = layer.batch_input_shape
        dtype = layer.dtype
        x = Input(
            batch_shape=batch_shape,
            dtype=dtype,
            name=layer.name + '_input'
        )
        layer(x)

    self._layers.append(layer)
```
