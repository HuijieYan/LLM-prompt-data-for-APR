Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the conditional statements where it checks if `self._layers` is empty to determine if it's the first layer in the model.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check for the first layer in the model is not considering the case where `self._layers` is not empty but the input layer is not explicitly defined. This results in the inference about whether it's the first layer being incorrect.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code should explicitly check if the layer is the first layer in the model, regardless of whether the `_layers` list is empty or not.

The corrected code for the `add` function is as follows:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        set_inputs = False
        if not hasattr(layer, '_batch_input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in the Sequential model '
                             'must have an "input_shape" attribute.')
        x = Input(batch_shape=layer._batch_input_shape, name='input_' + layer.name)
        layer(x)  # This will build the layer
        set_inputs = True
        self.outputs = [layer.output]
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                            'should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, '
                            'use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```
This corrected code explicitly checks the presence of `batch_input_shape` to determine if it's the first layer, and ensures that the model behaves as expected in both cases.
