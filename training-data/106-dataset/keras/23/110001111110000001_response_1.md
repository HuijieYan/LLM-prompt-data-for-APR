The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` is trying to create a nested sequential model, but it encounters an AttributeError when trying to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute of the first_layer object. This is because the first_layer is an instance of keras.layers.Dense, and Dense layers do not have a 'batch_input_shape' attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where it attempts to access the 'batch_input_shape' attribute of the first_layer.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function incorrectly assumes that the first_layer will always have a 'batch_input_shape' attribute, which is not the case, especially when adding non-input layers to the Sequential model.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the layer being added is an instance of the InputLayer before trying to access its 'batch_input_shape' attribute. If it is not an InputLayer, then the model should be constructed lazily on `fit`/etc.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `add`:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor to infer input shape and dtype.
        batch_shape = None
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            batch_shape = layer.batch_input_shape
        self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0]) if self.outputs else layer(self.inputs)
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                            'should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, '
                            'use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    self.build()
```
