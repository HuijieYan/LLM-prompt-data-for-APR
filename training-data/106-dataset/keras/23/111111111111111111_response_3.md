The error occurs because the function `add` is trying to access the attribute `batch_input_shape` of the `first_layer`, which is a `Dense` layer. However, `Dense` layers do not have a `batch_input_shape` attribute, hence causing an `AttributeError`. This is likely due to an incorrect assumption about the layer type.

To fix this, the function should be modified to handle different types of layers appropriately. If the layer is an `InputLayer`, it should handle it differently than other layer types such as `Dense` or nested models.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                                 'should have a single output tensor. '
                                 'For multi-output layers, '
                                 'use the functional API.')
            self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
            self.inputs = [network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])]
        else:
            # Other layers
            self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                            'should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, '
                            'use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
```

In the corrected code, the `add` method now checks if the layer being added is an instance of `InputLayer`. If it is, it sets the `outputs` and `inputs` accordingly. For other types of layers, it simply adds them to the list of layers. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure correct processing of various types of layers.
