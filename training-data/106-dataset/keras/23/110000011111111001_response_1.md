The error occurs because the function is trying to access the attribute `batch_input_shape` from the `first_layer` object, which is assumed to be an instance of a model or sequential model. However, the function does not properly handle the case where `first_layer` is a regular layer (e.g., Dense).

To fix this issue, the function should first check if the `layer` is an instance of `InputLayer` or `Model`, and then obtain the `batch_shape` and `dtype` accordingly. If it is not an `InputLayer`, the function should simply consider `layer` as a regular layer.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))

    self.built = False

    if not self._layers:
        # First layer in model: check that it is an input layer.
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            set_inputs = True
        else:
            # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
            # We will have to
            # build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
            set_inputs = False
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                            'should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, '
                            'use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

With these modifications, the function will properly handle regular layers when inferring the expected input shape and dtype, and avoid attribute errors when the layer is not a model or sequential model.
