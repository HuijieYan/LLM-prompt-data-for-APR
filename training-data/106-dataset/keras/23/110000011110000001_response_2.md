The error occurs when the `model` is adding the `inner_model` as a layer. This causes the AttributeError because the `batch_input_shape` attribute is being accessed on a layer that is not the InputLayer.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle adding a Sequential model as a layer to another Sequential model correctly. It assumes that the first layer of the sequential model is an input layer, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `add` function to handle the case when a Sequential model is being added as a layer. We need to check if the layer being added is an instance of Sequential and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        if not layer.built:
            if not layer.layers:
                raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model to a `Sequential` model.')
            self.built = False
            for l in layer.layers:
                self.add(l)
            return
        else:
            for l in layer.layers:
                self.add(l)
            return

    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```


By adding this modification, the `add` function will be able to handle adding a Sequential model as a layer to another Sequential model correctly.
