The issue with the `add` method is that it seems to be overcomplicated and contains unnecessary complexity. It also handles the case where the layer being added doesn't have an input shape in a convoluted manner.

The bug might be due to the unnecessary complexity in handling different cases when adding a layer. It seems to be trying to handle various edge cases when in reality, it can be simplified.

One approach to fix this bug is to simplify the `add` method. It should check the type of the layer, and if it's valid, simply append it to the list of layers. There's no need for all the detailed handling of input shapes and output tensors in this method.

Here's the corrected `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    self._layers.append(layer)
    self.built = False
```
