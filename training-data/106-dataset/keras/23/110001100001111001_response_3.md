The buggy function in this case is the `add` function of the Keras Sequential model. The function is intended to add a layer instance on top of the layer stack. However, there are issues such as the check for the input layer, handling multiple output tensors, and building the model with the input shape and dtype.

In Buggy case 1, when input parameter `layer` is of type `Dense`, it raises a TypeError in the line `if not isinstance(layer, Layer)`. This indicates that the `Layer` class may not be imported or defined correctly.

In Buggy case 5, it attempts to build the input layer, validate the building, and set the inputs. This process seems unnecessary and is causing the TypeError to occur.

In Buggy case 6, the function successfully adds a new layer to `_layers` and updates the `outputs`. However, the built structure is not consistent with the overall behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary checking and building in the function should be removed, and error handling should be improved.

Here is the corrected code for the `add` function of the Sequential model in Keras:
```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    if not self._layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in a Sequential model must be an InputLayer.')
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    self._layers.append(layer)
    self.built = False

```


In this corrected code:
1. The unnecessary input shape and dtype inference has been removed.
2. The error handling has been improved to check for the first layer in the model and the output tensors.
