The error occurs when the `add` method of the `Sequential` class is called with an inner sequential model as the layer. The error suggests that the `batch_input_shape` attribute is being accessed on a `Dense` layer object, which does not have that attribute.

The bug seems to occur because the `add` method is not handling the addition of inner sequential models correctly. It assumes that the `layer` argument is an instance of `Layer`, and then tries to access its `batch_input_shape` attribute, which may not be present for all layers.

To fix this, the `add` method should check if the `layer` is an instance of `Sequential` before attempting to access its `batch_input_shape`. If it is a `Sequential` instance, it should recursively handle building the inner model and connecting its layers.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        # If `layer` is a Sequential model, build it and add its layers to the current model
        if not layer.built:
            layer.build()
        for inner_layer in layer.layers:
            self.add(inner_layer)
    elif isinstance(layer, Layer):
        # If `layer` is a Layer instance, proceed with adding it to the current model
        self.built = False
        # rest of the code to add a regular layer
    else:
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer or Sequential. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
```

With this approach, if the `layer` is a `Sequential` model, the `add` method will recursively add the layers of the inner sequential model to the current model and handle their connections. If the `layer` is a regular `Layer` instance, it will be added as usual.
