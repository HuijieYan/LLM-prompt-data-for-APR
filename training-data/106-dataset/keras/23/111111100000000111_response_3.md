The potential error in the `add` method is that it is not correctly handling the case when a layer is added to the Sequential model.

The error occurs because the method is trying to handle the case when the layer is an instance of `InputLayer`, but it is not doing so correctly, resulting in the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case when a layer is an instance of `InputLayer` and properly set the inputs and outputs of the Sequential model.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
    if not self._layers:
        # If this is the first layer, set the input and output
        self.outputs = layer(self.outputs)
        self.inputs = layer.get_input_at(0)
    else:
        # For subsequent layers, update the output and input accordingly
        self.outputs = layer(self.outputs)
        self.inputs = self._layers[0].get_input_at(0)
    self._layers.append(layer)
```

This corrected code properly handles the addition of a layer to the Sequential model by setting the inputs and outputs based on the layer being added.
