The potential error location within the "add" function of the "Sequential" class seems to be the handling of the first layer in the model when it is added. The function tries to infer the expected input shape and dtype, but the logic for doing so is convoluted and leads to potential issues.

The bug occurs because the logic for inferring the input shape and dtype of the first layer is overly complex and prone to errors in various scenarios. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in how the first layer is handled.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the first layer should be simplified and made more explicit. The code should also be refactored to improve readability and reduce the potential for errors.

Here is the corrected code for the "add" function of the "Sequential" class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    if not self.outputs:
        # If no previous layer is added, set the current layer as the input layer
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor based on the layer's input shape and dtype
            input_shape = layer.compute_output_shape(None)
            x = Input(shape=input_shape)
            self.outputs = [x]
            self.inputs = [x]
        else:
            self.outputs = layer.output
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs)
    else:
        # Pass the outputs of the previous layer to the current layer
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model '
                            'should have a single output tensor. '
                            'For multi-output layers, '
                            'use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    # Mark the model as not built to trigger a rebuild on the next call to fit/evaluate
    self.built = False
