The issue seems to be that the function `add` is not structured to handle a nested sequential model when being added to the main model. The error message indicates that the attribute `batch_input_shape` is being accessed from a `Dense` layer object, which is not valid.

This error occurs because the current implementation of the `add` function doesn't properly handle nested models and their corresponding layers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `add` function to correctly handle the addition of a sequential model as a layer within another sequential model. This will involve checking the type of the `layer` parameter and handling nested models differently from regular layers.

Here's a corrected version of the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    from keras.layers import InputLayer, Input, Dense
    from keras.models import Model, Sequential

    if isinstance(layer, Sequential):
        if len(layer.layers) != 1 or not isinstance(layer.layers[0], InputLayer):
            raise ValueError('Nested models should have a single InputLayer.')

        # Add the nested model's layers to the main model
        for l in layer.layers:
            self.add(l)
    elif isinstance(layer, Dense):  # Update this condition to properly handle Dense layers
        self.built = False
        self._layers.append(layer)
    else:
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `layer` is an instance of the `Sequential` model. If it is, we ensure that it only contains a single `InputLayer` and then add all the layers within the nested model to the main model using a loop.

If the `layer` is a regular `Dense` layer, we simply add it to the main model's layers.

This updated `add` function should now be able to handle adding nested sequential models to the main model correctly.
