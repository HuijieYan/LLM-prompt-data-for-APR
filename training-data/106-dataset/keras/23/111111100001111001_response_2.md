The issue with the `add` method of the `Sequential` class is that it doesn't correctly handle adding the first layer to the model.

In every test case, the first layer is added to the model. The issue arises from the logic that performs input shape inference for the first layer. It tries to handle cases where the first layer can be an `InputLayer`, `Model`, or `Sequential`. This makes the code complex and error-prone for adding the first layer.

One approach to fixing this bug is to simplify the logic for adding the first layer. If the layer is an instance of `InputLayer`, it should set the input and output of the model. Otherwise, it should just add the layer to the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method of the `Sequential` class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            if not layer._inbound_nodes:
                # Create an input tensor and call the layer on the input tensor to set the input shape.
                input_tensor = Input(shape=layer.batch_input_shape[1:])
                outputs = layer(input_tensor)
                self.layers = [layer]
                self.outputs = outputs
                self.inputs = input_tensor
            else:
                raise ValueError('Input layer should not be connected to other layers.')
        else:
            self.outputs = self.inputs = layer(self.inputs)
            self.layers.append(layer)
    else:
        self.outputs = layer(self.outputs)
        self.layers.append(layer)
```

This code simplifies the logic for adding the first layer and subsequent layers, ensuring that the input and output are correctly handled based on whether it's the first layer being added to the model.
