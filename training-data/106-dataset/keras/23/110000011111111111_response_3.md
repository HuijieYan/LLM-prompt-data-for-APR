The test case `test_nested_sequential_deferred_build` creates a Sequential model `inner_model` and adds two Dense layers to it. Then, it creates another Sequential model `model` and attempts to add `inner_model` to it. This action leads to the error.

The error occurs within the `add` method of the Sequential model. The error message indicates that the 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape', which means that the method is trying to access an attribute that does not exist for the 'Dense' layer.

The potential error location is where the method tries to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute of the `layer`. This is likely to happen when the method is trying to infer the expected input shape and dtype of the layer.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the `Dense` layer differently when inferring the expected input shape and dtype. It should not try to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute for a `Dense` layer, as it does not have this attribute. Instead, the layer can be handled specifically for its input shape and dtype.

Here is the corrected `add` method for the Sequential model:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        set_inputs = False
        # First layer in model: check that it is an input layer.
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
            # First, we need to infer the expected input shape and dtype.
            first_layer = layer
            if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):

                # input shape and dtype.
                if not layer.layers:
                    raise ValueError('Cannot add an empty model '
                                     'to a `Sequential` model.')
                # Infer input shape and dtype for the first layer
                batch_shape, dtype = self._get_input_shape_and_dtype(layer.layers[0])

            else:
                # For standalone layers like Dense, infer input shape and dtype directly
                batch_shape, dtype = self._get_input_shape_and_dtype(layer)

            input_layer = Input(
                batch_shape=batch_shape,
                dtype=dtype,
                name=layer.name + '_input')
            layer(input_layer)
            set_inputs = True

        if set_inputs:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
            self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    elif self.outputs:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```
In the corrected method, I introduced the `_get_input_shape_and_dtype` method to handle the inference of input shape and dtype for both standalone layers and models. This approach should handle the nested Sequential model addition without trying to access unsupported attributes for certain layer types.
