Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring within the `add` method of the `Sequential` class. Specifically, the issue is related to accessing the `batch_input_shape` attribute of the `first_layer` object.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the fact that the `first_layer` object is not guaranteed to have a `batch_input_shape` attribute. This is evident from the error message stating that the 'Dense' object has no attribute 'batch_input_shape'. It seems that the code assumes the `batch_input_shape` attribute is always available, which is not the case for all layers.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Check if the `batch_input_shape` attribute exists before trying to access it. This can be achieved using Python's `hasattr` function.
2. If the `batch_input_shape` attribute is not present, handle this scenario gracefully by setting the `batch_shape` to a default value or triggering the necessary action to infer the input shape and dtype in a different way.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
