Potential Error Location:
The error could be occurring in the conditional block where the input layer is checked. If the `layer` is not an input layer, the function creates an input tensor and calls the `layer` on the input tensor. However, if the `layer` is already an input layer, the function checks if it has a single output tensor and sets the input flag to True. The bug could be due to incorrect handling or validation of input layers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where the `layer` is already an input layer. This results in a failure to set the input flag to True when it should be set for the input layer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should check if the `layer` is an instance of the `InputLayer` class and handle the input layer case separately. When the `layer` is an input layer, the function should ensure that it has a single output tensor and set the input flag accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
