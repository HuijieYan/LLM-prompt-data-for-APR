The buggy function seems to have issues with adding layers to the layer stack, especially when handling the first layer to be added.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the first layer to be added in the `add` method. When the first layer is added, it checks whether it is an `InputLayer`, and if not, it tries to create an input layer based on the shape and data type of the first layer, but this logic seems to be flawed, leading to potential errors when trying to add subsequent layers and handling multiple output tensors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the addition of the first layer by creating an InputLayer based on the shape and data type of the first layer.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, InputLayer, Input

def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if len(self._layers) == 0:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
            batch_shape = layer.input_shape
            dtype = layer.dtype
            input_layer = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
            layer(input_layer)
            self.inputs = [input_layer]
        else:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
            self.inputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
        self.outputs = [self.inputs[0]]
    else:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    
    self._layers.append(layer)
    self.built = False
``` 

This corrected function properly handles the addition of the first layer by creating an InputLayer with the correct batch shape and data type, and then it updates the `inputs` and `outputs` accordingly. Subsequent layers are added and connected based on the previous layer's output. Additionally, it sets the `self.built` attribute to `False` after adding a layer, indicating that the Sequential model needs to be rebuilt.
