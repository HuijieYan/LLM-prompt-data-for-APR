The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError at line 152 in the `add` function of the `Sequential` class. This AttributeError is caused by trying to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute of a `Dense` object, which does not exist.

The bug occurs because the `add` function in the `Sequential` class is trying to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute of the `Dense` layer without checking if it exists first. The `Dense` layer does not have a `batch_input_shape` attribute, which leads to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function to handle different types of layers, checking for the existence of the `batch_input_shape` attribute before accessing it.

Here's the corrected `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        set_inputs = False
        # First layer in model: check that it is an input layer.
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            # Create an input tensor and call `layer` on the input tensor.
            # First, we need to infer the expected input shape and dtype.
            if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                batch_shape = layer.batch_input_shape

                # Instantiate the input layer.
                x = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
                # This will build the current layer and create the node connecting the current layer
                # to the input layer we just created.
                layer(x)
                set_inputs = True
            else:
                # The layer doesn't know about its expected shape.
                # We will have to build the model lazily on `fit`/etc.
                batch_shape = None
        else:
            # Corner case where the user passes an InputLayer via `add`.
            assert len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) == 1
            set_inputs = True

        if set_inputs:
            if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '
                                     'For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
            self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    elif self.outputs:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. '

        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `layer` has a `batch_input_shape` attribute with the `hasattr` function before accessing it. If it exists, we use it to infer the input shape and dtype. If it doesn't exist, we handle that case accordingly.
