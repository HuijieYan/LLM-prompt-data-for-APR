The error occurs because the code is trying to access the `batch_input_shape` attribute from a `Dense` layer, which does not have that attribute. This occurs in the section where the first layer's input shape and dtype are being inferred.

To fix this issue, we need to differentiate between an `InputLayer` and other layer types when adding a new layer to the Sequential model. If the layer is an instance of `InputLayer`, we can directly set the input and output tensors. Otherwise, we need to handle the layer's input and output, and then check for the nested models if it is a Model or Sequential instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method of the Sequential class:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            self.outputs = layer.output
            self.inputs = layer.input
        else:
            x = layer.inbound_nodes[0].input_tensors
            output = layer(x)
            if isinstance(output, list):
                raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
            self.outputs = [output]
            self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(output)

    else:
        x = self.outputs
        output = layer(x)
        if isinstance(output, list):
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor. For multi-output layers, use the functional API.')
        self.outputs = [output]

    self._layers.append(layer)
    self.built = False
```

This corrected code ensures that the layers are added appropriately, building the Sequential model as required. It distinguishes between InputLayer and other layer types, handles inputs, and sets the output tensors correctly.
