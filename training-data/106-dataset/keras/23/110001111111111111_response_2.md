The error in the `add` method occurs because the `first_layer` is expected to have a `batch_input_shape` attribute, which is not available for the `Dense` layer instance.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `add` method to handle the case where `layer` is an instance of the `Dense` layer by directly adding it to the list of layers without attempting to access `batch_input_shape`. Additionally, we need to update the `self._layers` and the `set_inputs` variable based on whether the `layer` is an instance of `Sequential` or `Model`.

Here's the corrected `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.
    
    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.
    
    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    self.built = False
    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, (Model, Sequential)):
            set_inputs = False
            self._layers.extend(layer.layers)
        else:
            self._layers.append(layer)
            set_inputs = True
    else:
        set_inputs = True
        self._layers.append(layer)
    return set_inputs
```

In this corrected `add` method:
1. We check if the `layer` is an instance of either `Model` or `Sequential`. If yes, we extend the `_layers` list with the layers from the nested model.
2. If not, we simply add the `layer` to the `_layers` list and set `set_inputs` to True.

These changes enable the method to handle different types of layers appropriately and avoid the specific attribute error encountered in the buggy version.
