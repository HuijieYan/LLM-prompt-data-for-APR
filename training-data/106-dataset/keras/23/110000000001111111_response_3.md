The bug occurs in the function `add` because it fails to properly handle the addition of layers to a Sequential model in Keras. The function is intended to add a layer instance on top of the layer stack, but it contains logic that is causing unexpected behavior and error messages.

The bug occurs in the part of the function where it handles adding the first layer in the model. The logic for inferring the input shape and building the input layer is not correctly implemented, leading to errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the addition of the first layer in the model, infer the input shape and dtype correctly, and build the input layer before adding it to the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
    """
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    if not self._layers:
        if not hasattr(layer, '_batch_input_shape'):
            raise ValueError('The first layer in a Sequential model '
                             'must have an "input_shape" argument.')
        
        # Create an input layer
        batch_shape = layer._batch_input_shape
        dtype = layer.dtype
        x = Input(batch_shape=batch_shape, dtype=dtype, name=layer.name + '_input')
        layer(x)  # This will create the node connecting the layer to the input layer
        
        self.outputs = [layer.output]
        self.inputs = [x]
    else:
        if len(self.outputs) > 1 or (isinstance(self.outputs, list) and len(self.outputs) > 1):
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]
    
    self._layers.append(layer)
``` 

This corrected code handles the addition of the first layer correctly by inferring the input shape and building the input layer before adding it to the model. It also properly handles the addition of subsequent layers.
