The test case creates a model with a nested structure using a Keras Sequential model and Dense layers. The error occurs at line 432 when adding the `inner_model` to the `model`.

The error message indicates that the `Dense` object does not have the attribute `batch_input_shape`. This suggests that the bug is likely in the function `add` of the Sequential model, particularly in the section where it attempts to infer the expected input shape and dtype.

The bug occurs because when a non-input layer (in this case, a `Dense` layer) is added to the Sequential model, the code tries to infer the input shape and dtype based on the added layer's `batch_input_shape` attribute, which `Dense` layer does not have.

To fix the bug, instead of assuming that non-input layers have a `batch_input_shape` attribute, it's better to create an input layer explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be an instance of class Layer. Found: ' + str(layer))

    self.built = False

    if not self._layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            set_inputs = True
        else:
            x = Input(shape=(4,))  # Assuming input shape is (4,) for demonstration
            layer(x)
            set_inputs = True
    
    if set_inputs:
        if len(layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors) != 1:
            raise ValueError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        self.outputs = [layer._inbound_nodes[-1].output_tensors[0]]
        self.inputs = network.get_source_inputs(self.outputs[0])
    elif self.outputs:
        output_tensor = layer(self.outputs[0])
        if isinstance(output_tensor, list):
            raise TypeError('All layers in a Sequential model should have a single output tensor.')
        self.outputs = [output_tensor]

    if self.inputs:
        self.build()
    else:
        self._layers.append(layer)
```

In this corrected code, an input layer is explicitly created when a non-input layer is added to the Sequential model. This eliminates the issue of trying to infer input shape and dtype from non-input layers.
