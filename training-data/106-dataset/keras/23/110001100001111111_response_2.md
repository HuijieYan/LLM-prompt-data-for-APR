The buggy function is the `add` method of the Sequential model in Keras. The method attempts to add a layer to the model, setting the input shape if needed and raising errors for certain conditions.

The bug occurs in the section of the function where it is checking for the input layer and trying to set the input shape if needed. It fails to correctly handle some situations, leading to incorrect model configurations and potential errors during model building.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where an input layer needs to be created and set the input shape correctly. Additionally, we should ensure that the model configuration is updated appropriately when new layers are added.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` method:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    if not isinstance(layer, Layer):
        raise TypeError('The added layer must be '
                        'an instance of class Layer. '
                        'Found: ' + str(layer))
    
    if not self._layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            input_shape = None
            if hasattr(layer, 'batch_input_shape'):
                input_shape = layer.batch_input_shape[1:]  # Exclude batch size
            self.build(input_shape)
    
    output = layer(self.outputs[0])
    if not isinstance(output, list):
        output = [output]
    self.outputs = output
    self._layers.append(layer)
``` 

In this corrected code, we are handling the situation where an input layer needs to be created and setting the input shape correctly if it's available. Then we update the model configuration based on the added layer.
