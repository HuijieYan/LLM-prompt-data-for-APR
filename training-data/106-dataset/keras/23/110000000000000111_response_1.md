Potential error location: The potential error location is in the section where the code checks if the layer is an instance of InputLayer and tries to set the inputs based on the layer's properties.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not handling certain cases properly, such as when the layer doesn't know its expected shape or when the layer is an InputLayer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Handle the case where the layer doesn't know its expected shape by deferring the model building until it is needed (e.g., during fitting).
2. Properly handle the case where the layer is an InputLayer and set the inputs accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def add(self, layer):
    """Adds a layer instance on top of the layer stack.

    # Arguments
        layer: layer instance.

    # Raises
        TypeError: If `layer` is not a layer instance.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument does not
            know its input shape.
        ValueError: In case the `layer` argument has
            multiple output tensors, or is already connected
            somewhere else (forbidden in `Sequential` models).
