The bug in the provided function is that it does not properly handle redirection based on the 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute of the spider. This can lead to incorrect redirection behavior when the spider's 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute is set.

The potential error location is in the 'process_response' method of the 'RedirectMiddleware' class, specifically in the condition that checks if the response status is in the spider's 'handle_httpstatus_list'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly consider the spider's 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute while handling the response status for redirection.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'process_response' method to correctly handle the response status based on the spider's 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute.

Corrected code for the 'process_response' method of the 'RedirectMiddleware' class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    # Handle redirection based on response status and 'Location' header
    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    # Handle redirection for specific response statuses and 'Location' header
    if response.status in [302, 303, 301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
