Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the conditional statements that check for response status and request method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The conditional check for response status and request method is not comprehensive, as it only covers certain cases and does not cover all possible scenarios.
2. The `urljoin` function is used to join URLs, but there is no import for this function in the code. 
3. The `_redirect_request_using_get` and `_redirect` methods are being called, but their implementations are not provided in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional checks to cover all relevant response status codes and request methods.
2. Import the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module to be able to use it in the code.
3. Implement the `_redirect_request_using_get` and `_redirect` methods or replace these method calls with appropriate functionality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303, 301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

Note: This corrected code includes the import statement for `urljoin` and handles the response's location header as bytes, decoding it to a string before using it to create the redirected URL. It assumes that `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods are implemented elsewhere in the code. If not, those methods also need to be implemented accordingly.
