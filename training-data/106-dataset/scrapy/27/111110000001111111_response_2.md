The potential error in the `process_response` function is that it does not properly handle the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. The bug occurs because the function does not check if the response status is included in the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`, which could lead to incorrect redirection behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `process_response` function to properly handle the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. We can check if the response status is in the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` and only redirect if it is not. We also need to handle the case where `handle_httpstatus_list` is not present in the spider's attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or \
            (hasattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list') and response.status in spider.handle_httpstatus_list):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the spider has the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute, and if it does, we use it to determine whether to redirect the response. We also handled the case where the `Location` header is encoded as bytes by decoding it as UTF-8. This should fix the bug and make the `RedirectMiddleware` respect the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list`.
