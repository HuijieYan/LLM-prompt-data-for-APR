Potential error location: The `_redirect_request_using_get` function is called within the `process_response` function, but it is not defined anywhere in the given code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_redirect_request_using_get` function is being called within the `process_response` function, but it is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the `process_response` function is executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the `_redirect_request_using_get` function within the same class where the `process_response` function is defined, or import it from another module if it is supposed to be a part of an external library.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_27/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/redirect.py

from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(object):

    def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
        # Define the _redirect_request_using_get function
        pass

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
