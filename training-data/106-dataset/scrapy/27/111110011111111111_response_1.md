1. The test case `_test_passthrough` is trying to simulate a situation where a request with a specific meta is passed to the `RedirectMiddleware` and the `process_response` method is called. The test case checks if the response returned is the same as the input response.

2. The potential error location seems to be in the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class.

3. The error occurred because the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method was not correctly handling the base URL and the URL to join. It seems that the URL and the `Location` header are not of the same type or format, causing the error.

4. To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function should have both the base URL and the URL to join in string format. The `Location` header should also be converted to a string before it is used with the `urljoin` function. Once these changes are made, the bug should be fixed.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, `decode('utf-8')` is used to convert the `Location` header to a string format before using it with the `urljoin` function. This should address the bug and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
