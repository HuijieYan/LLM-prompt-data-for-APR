The error occurs in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. It seems that the issue is related to mixing string and non-string arguments in the `urljoin` function from the Python standard library.

The reason behind the bug is that the `response.headers['location']` is of type bytes, and it needs to be converted to a string for joining with the request URL, which is of type string. This causes a mismatch of types and triggers a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `response.headers['location']` is decoded to a string before it is joined with the request URL. We can use the `decode` method to convert the bytes to a string.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ...

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

With this change, the bytes value for the 'Location' header in the response will be decoded to a string before being used in the `urljoin` function, resolving the TypeError and fixing the bug related to mixing string and non-string arguments.
