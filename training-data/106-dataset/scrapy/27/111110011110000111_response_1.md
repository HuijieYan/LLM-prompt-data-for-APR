1. The test case `test_request_meta_handling` involves calling the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class with a request and response as parameters. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to mixing `str` and non-`str` arguments, specifically in the `urljoin` function.

2. The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the usage of the `urljoin` function to combine the base URL and the redirected URL.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` function expects both the base URL and the URL to be of type `str`. However, in this case, the base URL is a string, and the redirected URL is of type bytes (b''). This mismatch in data types leads to the `TypeError` indicating that mixing `str` and non-`str` arguments is not allowed.

4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that both the base URL and the redirected URL are of the same data type (either `str` or bytes). Additionally, handling the conversion between bytes and `str` may be required to ensure compatibility.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

In the corrected code:
- We ensure that the `Location` value from the response headers is of type bytes.
- We use the `decode` method to convert the bytes to a `str` before calling `urljoin`.
- This ensures that the arguments passed to `urljoin` are of the same data type, resolving the `TypeError` caused by mixing `str` and non-`str` arguments.
