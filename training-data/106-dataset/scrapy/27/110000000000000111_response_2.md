Potential error location:
The potential error is in the `process_response` function. It seems that the function is not effectively handling the HTTP status codes and redirections based on the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `process_response` function is not properly checking and handling the HTTP status codes using the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. As a result, the redirection logic is not correctly implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `process_response` function properly checks for the HTTP status codes and handles redirections based on the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. This can be done by updating the logic to correctly utilize the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute and ensure that the redirections are handled appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# corrected process_response function
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
In the corrected code, the logic for handling HTTP status codes and redirections has been updated to properly utilize the `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute of the spider. This should address the issue and ensure that the redirections are handled in accordance with the spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute.
