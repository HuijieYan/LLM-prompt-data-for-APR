The error is occurring because the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method of `RedirectMiddleware` is taking a string and a bytes object as arguments. The `urljoin` function expects both arguments to be of the same type (either string or bytes), and it raises a `TypeError` when they are not.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both arguments passed to the `urljoin` function are of the same type.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of `RedirectMiddleware`:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

In the corrected code, we are decoding the bytes object obtained from the `response.headers[b'Location']` to a string using the `decode('utf-8')` method before passing it to the `urljoin` function.
