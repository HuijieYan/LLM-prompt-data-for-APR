The error occurs when the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` tries to join a string with a bytes object. This causes a TypeError because the `urljoin` function doesn't support mixing string and bytes arguments.

To fix this bug, the `response.headers['location']` (which is a bytes object) needs to be decoded to a string before it's joined with the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method in the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

The code has been updated to decode the bytes object in `response.headers['location']` using the `decode('utf-8')` method before using it in the `urljoin` function. This will fix the TypeError that was occurring.
