Potential error location: The potential error could be in the conditional statements checking the response status and handling redirection.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring because the conditionals are not accurately handling all cases of redirection based on the response status.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check all possible redirect status codes and handle redirection accordingly.
2. Use the Spider's handle_httpstatus_list to determine if a specific HTTP status code should be followed or not.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
        response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
