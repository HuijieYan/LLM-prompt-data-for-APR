The error message indicates a TypeError related to mixing string and non-string arguments while invoking the `urljoin` function. This suggests that there might be an issue with the data types being passed to the `urljoin` function.

Upon inspecting the code, the issue seems to be with the instantiation of the `rsp` object in the `_test_passthrough` function inside the test case. The 'headers' key is being provided with a string value, which is causing the TypeError when calling the `urljoin` function.

The presence of the 'b' prefix before the URL inside the `args` tuple indicates that there is a byte string being passed where a regular string is expected.

To fix this bug, the 'headers' key should be updated to use regular strings instead of byte strings to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
