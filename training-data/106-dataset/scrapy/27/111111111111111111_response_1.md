The error occurs when the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class is being called with a response that has a status code of 301 and a 'Location' header. The error is specifically related to the `urljoin` function in the `process_response` method, which is trying to join the base URL with the redirected URL.

The error message indicates that there is a TypeError raised within the `urljoin` function, stating that "Cannot mix str and non-str arguments". This error occurs when trying to concatenate a string and a byte string, which is not allowed.

To fix the bug, the `redirected_url` should be decoded from bytes to a string before using it in the `urljoin` function. This will ensure that the base URL and the redirected URL are both of the same type (string) before attempting to join them.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
        
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
        
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        
        return response
```

By decoding the 'Location' header from bytes to string using `.decode('utf-8')`, we ensure that the URL is in a compatible format for joining with the base URL in the `urljoin` function. This should resolve the TypeError that was previously occurring.
