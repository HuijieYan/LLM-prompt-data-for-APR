Potential error location:
The bug seems to be in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue arises from the `if` conditions that check for response status codes and the handling of redirection based on these status codes.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `process_response` function does not properly handle different redirection status codes and their corresponding actions. The code does not respect the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute, which is used to specify which HTTP status codes should be handled by the spider.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `process_response` function to check if the response status code is in the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` and handle the redirection accordingly.
2. Use the Spider's `handle_httpstatus_list` attribute to determine if a response status code should trigger a redirection.
3. Update the code to handle different redirection status codes based on the Spider's configuration.

Corrected code for the `process_response` function:
```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in spider.handle_httpstatus_list and 'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
