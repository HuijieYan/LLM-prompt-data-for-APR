Potential error location: The bug may occur in the condition that checks whether the request method is 'HEAD' and if the response status is in [301, 302, 303, 307].

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. For Buggy case 1: The 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute is missing from the spider, which causes the condition to return False. 
2. For Buggy case 2: The 'handle_httpstatus_list' attribute is missing, and the condition checks for 'handle_httpstatus_all' which is not present in the request.meta.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the 'handle_httpstatus_all' attribute if 'handle_httpstatus_list' is not present when the spider doesn't have a specific list of status codes to handle.
2. For both cases, handle the redirection depending on the presence of the 'Location' header in the response and the request method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or (
            hasattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_all') and 
            spider.handle_httpstatus_all
        ):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD' and response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307]:
            if b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
