The error is occurring in the `urljoin` function inside the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. This error is due to the fact that the `response.headers['location']` is of type bytes, while the `request.url` is of type str. This mismatch in types is causing the `urljoin` function to raise a `TypeError` due to mixing str and non-str arguments.

To fix this bug, you can explicitly decode the `response.headers['location']` to convert it from bytes to str before using it in the `urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```

By decoding the `response.headers['Location']` from bytes to str using the `decode` method, we ensure that both arguments passed to the `urljoin` function are of the same type (str), resolving the TypeError in the original code.
