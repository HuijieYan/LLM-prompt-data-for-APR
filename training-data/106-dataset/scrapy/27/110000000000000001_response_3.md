The potential error in the `process_response` function is with the conditional statements for handling different HTTP status codes and redirecting to the corresponding URLs. There are a few issues in the code: 
1. In the first conditional statement, the `getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])` should be replaced with `getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])`.
2. The conditions for handling status code 301, 302, 303, 307 and status code 302, 303 respectively are not accurate.

To fix the function, the code can be corrected as below:

```python
from w3lib.url import urljoin
from scrapy.http import Request, Response

class YourSpider:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handle_httpstatus_list = []

    def process_response(self, request: Request, response: Response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
                or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

            elif response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response

    def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirected_url):
        # add your logic for redirecting using GET method
        pass

    def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, status):
        # add your logic for redirection handling
        pass
```
