The bug in the given function "process_response" is related to the logic for handling HTTP status codes in the case of redirects. The function is supposed to respect the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" attribute, but it is not handling it correctly, which leads to incorrect behavior.

The potential error location is in the section where the function checks if the response status is in the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" attribute. It should properly consider the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" and "handle_httpstatus_all" attributes to determine how to handle the response status.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly taking into account the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" attribute and "handle_httpstatus_all" attribute. This leads to incorrect handling of HTTP status codes during redirects.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" and "handle_httpstatus_all" attributes and handle the response status accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the "process_response" function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if spider.handle_httpstatus_all or response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307]:
        if 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['Location'])
            if request.method == 'HEAD':
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In the corrected code, we properly consider both the spider's "handle_httpstatus_list" attribute and "handle_httpstatus_all" attribute to determine how to handle the response status during redirects. This will ensure that the RedirectMiddleware respects the spider's handling of HTTP status codes.
