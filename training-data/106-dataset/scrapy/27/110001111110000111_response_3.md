1. The test case aims to test the behavior of the `process_response` function in the `RedirectMiddleware` class when handling a response with status code 301 and a `Location` header. The test passes a request with the meta attribute `handle_httpstatus_list` set to `[404, 301, 302]` and expects the response to be returned without further processing.

2. The error occurs in the `urljoin` function, which is called in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error is a `TypeError` stating "Cannot mix str and non-str arguments".

3. The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` function expects its arguments to be of type str, but the response headers contain a non-str argument.

4. To fix the bug, the URL from the response headers should be explicitly converted to a string before being passed to the `urljoin` function.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:  # Assuming RedirectMiddleware is the class containing the process_response method

    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to str
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to str
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to str
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_utl)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

By explicitly converting the URL from the response headers to a string before passing it to the `urljoin` function, the TypeError should be resolved.
