The bug occurs in the function `process_response` of the class `RedirectMiddleware`. The error message indicates a TypeError at line 534 of `urllib/parse.py` in the `urljoin` function. This error is caused by mixing string and non-string arguments in the `urljoin` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the `urljoin` function expects both `base` and `url` arguments to be of type `str`, but the `url` argument is of type `bytes` when parsing the response headers.

To fix this bug, the `redirected_url` should be decoded to a string before using it in the `urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, the `location` header is decoded from bytes to a UTF-8 encoded string before using it in the `urljoin` function. This will resolve the TypeError caused by mixing string and non-string arguments.
