1. The test case "test_request_meta_handling" is trying to test the functionality of the `_test_passthrough` function, which in turn calls the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The test is passing a request with a specific `handle_httpstatus_list` meta to the `process_response` function and expects it to return a response without any errors.

2. The potential error location is within the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class, specifically when trying to construct the `redirected_url` using the `urljoin` function.

3. The error occurs because the `urljoin` function is receiving a `str` and a `bytes` object as input, causing a `TypeError` to be raised. This happens because the `response.headers['location']` is likely a `bytes` object.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `urljoin` function receives string input for both `base` and `url` arguments. This can be achieved by decoding the `response.headers['location']` to a string before passing it to the `urljoin` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
           response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response
        
    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
