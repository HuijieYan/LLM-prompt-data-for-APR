Potential error location:
The bug seems to be in the process_response method of the RedirectMiddleware class, where the handling of response statuses and redirection is not taking into account the spider's handle_httpstatus_list attribute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the process_response method is not considering the spider's handle_httpstatus_list attribute when handling response statuses and redirection.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the spider has the handle_httpstatus_list attribute, and if it does, use it to determine if the response status should be handled.
2. Modify the logic to consider the spider's handle_httpstatus_list attribute when deciding whether to redirect based on the response status.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```
The corrected code now checks if the spider has the handle_httpstatus_list attribute and uses it to determine whether to handle the response status.
