The bug occurs in the 'process_response' function of the 'RedirectMiddleware' class. The error message suggests a type error related to mixing string and non-string arguments, particularly in the 'urljoin' function from the 'urllib' library.

The bug is occurring because the 'urljoin' function requires both the 'base' and 'url' arguments to be strings, but the 'url' argument is a bytes object. This mismatch leads to a type error.

To fix this bug, the bytes object needs to be decoded into a string before being used in the 'urljoin' function. One way to do this is by using the 'decode' method on the bytes object.

Here's the corrected code for the 'process_response' function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'Location'].decode())
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

With these changes, the previous type error should no longer occur, and the function should handle redirection properly.
