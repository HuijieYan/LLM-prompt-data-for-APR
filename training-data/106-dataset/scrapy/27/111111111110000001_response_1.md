The error message indicates a TypeError related to mixing str and non-str arguments. This is likely caused by using a str type argument and a bytes type argument when trying to create a URL using the `urljoin` function.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is at this line:
```python
redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` function expects both arguments to be of the same type (either both str or both bytes), and it cannot handle a mix of both types.

To fix this bug, the bytes type URL needs to be decoded into a string type before being passed to the `urljoin` function. This can be done using the `decode('utf-8')` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
        return response

    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        else:
            return response

    if response.status in [302, 303] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if response.status in [301, 307] and b'Location' in response.headers:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers[b'location'].decode('utf-8'))
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```
