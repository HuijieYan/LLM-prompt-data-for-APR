Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring when the `urljoin` function is called with a `bytes` object as the second argument, which violates its expected input format. This error suggests that the `response.headers['location']` attribute contains a `bytes` object instead of a `str` object.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The response header `Location` is expected to be a string, but it is being received as a bytes object, leading to a type mismatch when passed to the `urljoin` function.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, you can convert the `response.headers['location']` from bytes to a string before passing it to the `urljoin` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Convert from bytes to string
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Convert from bytes to string
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Convert from bytes to string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
