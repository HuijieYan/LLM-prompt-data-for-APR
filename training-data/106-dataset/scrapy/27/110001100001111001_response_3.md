Potential Error: 
The `_redirect_request_using_get` method is called with `request` and `redirected_url` as parameters, but the method is missing in the code provided.

Reason behind the bug:
The `_redirect_request_using_get` method is being called but is not defined in the code, which would result in a 'method not found' error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `_redirect_request_using_get` method in the code.
2. If the `_redirect_request_using_get` method is not necessary, remove the call to it and modify the code accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_27/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/redirect.py
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    # corrected function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```
