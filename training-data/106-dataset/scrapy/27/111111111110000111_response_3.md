The error occurs in the `_coerce_args()` function in the `urllib/parse.py` module, which is called by the `urljoin()` function. It seems that the `urljoin()` function is receiving a mix of string and non-string arguments, which is not allowed.

The bug is likely caused by the `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])` line in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. It appears that the `response.headers['location']` is not in the correct format, causing the `urljoin` function to receive a non-string argument.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `response.headers['location']` is converted to a string before being passed to the `urljoin` function.

Corrected function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response

        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to string
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response

        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to string
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, str(response.headers['location']))  # Convert to string
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```
