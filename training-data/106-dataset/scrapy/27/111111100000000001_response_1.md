The potential error location is within the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The bug seems to be related to the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions being called incorrectly, as well as a missing import for `urljoin`.

The bug occurs because the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions are being called as if they were instance methods (i.e., with `self` as the first argument), but they are defined as standalone functions. Additionally, the `urljoin` function is being used without being imported.

To fix the bug, the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions should be called as standalone functions with their appropriate arguments, and the `urljoin` function should be imported from `urllib.parse`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
               response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])):
            return response
    
        if request.method == 'HEAD':
            if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return _redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
            else:
                return response
    
        if response.status in [302, 303] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = _redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return _redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if response.status in [301, 307] and 'Location' in response.headers:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'])
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return _redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        return response
```
