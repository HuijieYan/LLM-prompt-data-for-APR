1. The test case is checking whether the function `is_gzipped` correctly identifies a response as gzipped when the Content-Type header includes the charset parameter.

2. The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the expected values for gzipped content types.

3. The bug occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for exact matches of the `Content-Type` header with `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`. It does not take into account cases where the `Content-Type` header includes additional parameters like `charset`.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header contains the string "gzip" instead of exact matches.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

By checking if "gzip" is in the `Content-Type` header, the function can correctly identify a gzipped response even when additional parameters like `charset` are present in the header.
