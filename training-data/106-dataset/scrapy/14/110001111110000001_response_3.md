Potential error location: The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function is in the comparison of the `Content-Type` header. The function is checking for an exact match with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, but the test case includes the additional `charset=utf-8` in the `Content-Type` header, which causes the function to return False.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the `is_gzipped` function is not handling the case where the `Content-Type` header includes a charset.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header includes 'gzip' as a substring, instead of doing an exact match.
2. Ignore the 'charset' part if it exists in the `Content-Type` header when checking for gzip content.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
