The error occurs because the function `is_gzipped` only checks for content types `'application/x-gzip'` or `'application/gzip'` without considering the charset part of the content type header.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to account for the content type header that includes charset.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.getlist('Content-Type')
    return any(b'gzip' in ct for ct in ctype)
```

This modification will ensure that the function correctly identifies the content type as gzipped even when it includes the charset in the header.
