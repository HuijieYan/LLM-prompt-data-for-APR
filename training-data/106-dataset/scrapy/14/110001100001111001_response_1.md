Potential Error Location: 
The bug is likely in the `is_gzipped` function where the content type (ctype) is compared with the expected gzip content type. 

Reason for Bug:
The content type comparison in the `is_gzipped` function only checks for exact matches with 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip', but the content type in the response headers also includes the character encoding. This causes the comparison to fail.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' exists within the content type.

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
