The issue here is that the `is_gzipped` function is only checking for the exact strings 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header. It does not take into account any charset information that may be present in the header.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the Content-Type header contains 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' regardless of the presence of charset information.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this modification, the `is_gzipped` function will now correctly identify the Content-Type header with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' regardless of any additional charset information, and the issue described in the GitHub message should be resolved.
