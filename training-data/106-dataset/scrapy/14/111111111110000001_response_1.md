The potential error in the function `is_gzipped` is with the content type check. The function is checking for the content type to be either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, but in the test case, the content type includes a charset as well, which is not being accounted for in the function.

The test case is expecting the response to be identified as gzipped, but the function is returning False instead of True.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to check if the content type starts with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` to account for any additional charset or parameters. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With the above correction, the test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` should now pass without any assertion errors.
