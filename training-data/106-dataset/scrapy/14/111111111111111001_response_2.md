The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is likely occurring because the function is checking for exact matches of the 'Content-Type' header with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', and in the buggy case, the header value includes the character set ('charset=utf-8') which causes the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the 'Content-Type' header contains 'gzip' instead of exact matches.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify gzipped content even if there are additional parameters in the 'Content-Type' header.
