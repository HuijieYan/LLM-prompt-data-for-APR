Potential Error Location:
The problem may be with the comparison in the "is_gzipped" function. It checks if the content type is "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip", but it does not take into account the additional charset in the content type.

Reasons for Bug:
The "is_gzipped" function does not handle the charset in the content type header. As a result, when the test case sets the content type to "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8", the function returns False because it only checks for "application/x-gzip" without considering the charset.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the "is_gzipped" function to handle content types with charset. We can split the content type header and then check if the content type starts with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip".

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '').split(';')[0]
    return ctype in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
```
With the corrected code, the "is_gzipped" function will now split the content type header at the semicolon, and then check if the content type starts with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip". This modification will handle content types with and without charset, thereby fixing the bug.
