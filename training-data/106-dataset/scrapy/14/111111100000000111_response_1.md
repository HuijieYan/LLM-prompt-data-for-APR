The potential error location within the is_gzipped function is the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header with the allowed gzip types. The function only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' and does not take into account cases where the 'Content-Type' header may include additional parameters such as 'charset'.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the 'Content-Type' header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'. As a result, the function incorrectly returns False for 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle cases where the 'Content-Type' header includes additional parameters such as 'charset'. One approach is to split the 'Content-Type' header to extract the main type and then check if it matches any of the gzip types.

Here's the corrected code for the is_gzipped function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]  # Extract the main type
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```
