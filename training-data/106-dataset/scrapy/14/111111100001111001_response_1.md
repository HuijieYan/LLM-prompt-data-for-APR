The buggy function is `is_gzipped`. The function is incorrectly checking if the content type is either `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`. However, in the provided test case, the content type is `application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8`, which does not match the conditions in the function, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the content type contains the substring `gzip` instead of matching exactly with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify a gzipped response even if the content type includes additional parameters like `charset=utf-8`. This should resolve the bug and provide the expected behavior.
