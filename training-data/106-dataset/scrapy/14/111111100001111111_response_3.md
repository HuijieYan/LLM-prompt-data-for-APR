The bug is occurring because the function `is_gzipped` is only checking for the exact content types `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`, and it does not take into account any additional parameters such as `charset=utf-8` that may be present in the `Content-Type` header.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the presence of `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'` in the `Content-Type` header, regardless of any additional parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the `Content-Type` header with additional parameters such as `charset=utf-8` and return `True` if the response is gzipped.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allows the function to handle `Content-Type` headers with additional parameters.
