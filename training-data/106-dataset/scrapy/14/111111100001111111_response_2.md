The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is that it only checks for specific content types (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'), and it doesn't take into account cases where the Content-Type header would include charset.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', instead of checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this change, the function will correctly identify 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8' as a gzipped content type.
