The bug occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for exact matches of `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`, but does not account for cases where the `Content-Type` header includes additional parameters like `charset=utf-8`. This leads to the function returning False for Content-Type headers like `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the `Content-Type` header starts with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, instead of exact matches. This will allow the function to correctly identify gzipped content even if there are additional parameters in the `Content-Type` header.

The corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
