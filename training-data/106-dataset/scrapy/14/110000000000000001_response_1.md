The potential error in the given function is in the comparison of content type. The function is trying to match the response Content-Type header with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' to determine if the response is gzipped.

The bug occurs because 'Content-Type' header in the response is in the form of 'text/html; charset=utf-8' rather than 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'. 

To fix this, we need to check if the response Content-Encoding header contains 'gzip' to determine if the response is gzipped. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', '')
    return 'gzip' in content_encoding
```
