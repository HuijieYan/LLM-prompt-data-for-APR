The error occurs when the test function `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` is run and it fails with the error message `AssertionError: False is not true`. This indicates that the `is_gzipped` function is returning `False` when it should return `True` in this specific case where the 'Content-Type' header includes 'charset=utf-8'.

The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is in the line `return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')`. This code only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, but it does not take into account the possibility of it including 'charset' as well.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_gzipped` function does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes 'charset', as pointed out in the GitHub issue description. This leads to incorrect evaluation and returning of `False` instead of `True`.

To fix the bug, the `is_gzipped` function needs to be modified to consider the case where the Content-Type includes 'charset'. This can be achieved by checking only for 'application/x-gzip' in the Content-Type header, regardless of additional parameters such as 'charset'.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'application/x-gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the `is_gzipped` function will correctly handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like 'charset', and the test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset` should pass without any errors.
