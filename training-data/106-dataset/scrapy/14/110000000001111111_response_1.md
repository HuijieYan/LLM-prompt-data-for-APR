The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function lies in the comparison of the `Content-Type` header. The function is checking for an exact match of the header value with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, but it does not take into account additional parameters like `charset` that may be included in the `Content-Type` header.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the `Content-Type` header includes additional parameters like `charset`. As a result, it returns False even when the content is gzipped, as in the case of `application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8`.

To fix this bug, the function should only compare the beginning of the `Content-Type` header value to check if it starts with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, ignoring any additional parameters.

The corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function is as follows:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

This updated code will now correctly identify the content as gzipped even when the `Content-Type` header includes additional parameters like `charset`.
