The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is in the way it checks for the content type. The function is checking for an exact match of the content type with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', but it's not taking into account the possibility of additional parameters like 'charset=utf-8' in the content type header.

The test case is failing because the content type header includes additional parameters, causing the function to return False when it should return True.

To fix the bug, the function needs to parse the content type header and extract the main content type for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```

In the corrected code, we split the content type header by the ';' character and take the first part, which represents the main content type. Then we check if this main content type matches 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'.

This fix will ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the response is gzipped, even if the content type includes additional parameters.
