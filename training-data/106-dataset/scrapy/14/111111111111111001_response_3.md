The potential error in the problematic function `is_gzipped` is the comparison of the content type `ctype` with the expected value. The content type `response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')` does not only contain 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', but also includes the character set information 'charset=utf-8'. As a result, the comparison is not evaluating to True as expected.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' instead of checking for an exact match. This way, it will ignore the character set information.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly identify if the response is gzipped, and the test case that was failing previously should now pass.
