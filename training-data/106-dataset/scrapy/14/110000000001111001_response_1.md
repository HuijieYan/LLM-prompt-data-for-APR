The bug in the provided function `is_gzipped` is that it only checks for exact matches of content types `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`, and does not account for cases where the content type includes additional parameters such as `charset=utf-8`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the content type starts with either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, allowing for additional parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(ct in ctype for ct in [b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'])
```
