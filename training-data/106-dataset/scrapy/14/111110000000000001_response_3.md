Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the comparison of the `Content-Type` header with the expected gzip types. The function is looking for `application/x-gzip` and `application/gzip`, however, the standard `Content-Type` for gzipped content is `application/gzip` or `application/x-gzip`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because the function is not checking for the standard `Content-Type` values for gzipped content, leading to incorrect detection of whether the response is gzipped or not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Update the function to check for the standard `Content-Type` values for gzipped content, and also account for variations in the `charset` parameter that may be present in the `Content-Type` header.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return re.search(r'application/(x-)?gzip', ctype)
```
