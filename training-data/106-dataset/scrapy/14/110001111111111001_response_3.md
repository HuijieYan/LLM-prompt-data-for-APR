The problem lies in the `is_gzipped` function. It currently checks if the content type is exactly 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', but in the test case, the content type is 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'. Therefore, the function returns False instead of True.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' instead of checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').decode('utf-8')
    return ctype.startswith('application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith('application/gzip')
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8' as a gzipped content type and the test case should pass without any errors.
