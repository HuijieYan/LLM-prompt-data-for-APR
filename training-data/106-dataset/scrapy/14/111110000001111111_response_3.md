The issue with the `is_gzipped` function is that it only checks for the exact Content-Type values of `application/x-gzip` and `application/gzip`. However, the response header in the test case includes the `charset=utf-8` parameter, which causes the function to return False, even though the response is actually gzipped.

The `is_gzipped` function needs to be modified to properly handle cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as `charset`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

By using the `any` function, we can check if any of the specified Content-Type values are present in the response header, which allows for the presence of additional parameters such as `charset`. This will accurately determine if the response is gzipped.

The modified function should now correctly identify responses that are gzipped, even if the Content-Type header includes additional parameters.
