The potential error in the code is in the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header with the expected values for gzipped content. The 'Content-Type' header typically specifies the type of the content, such as 'text/html', 'application/json', etc. The expected values for gzipped content should be checked in the 'Content-Encoding' header instead of 'Content-Type'.

To fix the bug, we need to change the code to check the 'Content-Encoding' header for gzip encoding. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', '')
    return 'gzip' in encoding
```
