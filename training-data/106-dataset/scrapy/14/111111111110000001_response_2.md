Potential error location within the problematic function: The function is_gzipped is returning False when it should return True for the provided Content-Type value "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is only checking for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header values. It is not taking into account the additional charset parameter in the header value, causing the function to incorrectly return False.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Modify the function to check if the Content-Type header includes 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' as a substring, instead of a direct match.

```python
# Corrected function
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
