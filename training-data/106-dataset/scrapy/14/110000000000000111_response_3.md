Potential error location: The 'is_gzipped' function is checking the 'Content-Type' header of the response for 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', but it does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters, such as 'charset'.

Reason for the bug: The function does not handle cases where the 'Content-Type' header includes additional parameters like 'charset', causing it to incorrectly determine whether the response is gzipped or not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Modify the function to check for 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' as part of the 'Content-Type' header, ignoring any additional parameters such as 'charset'.
2. Use a library like `gzip` to explicitly check if the response content is gzipped.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import gzip
import io

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    if 'Content-Encoding' in response.headers and response.headers['Content-Encoding'] == 'gzip':
        return True
    elif 'Content-Type' in response.headers:
        content_type = response.headers['Content-Type'].split(';')[0]
        return content_type in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
    
    # If no Content-Encoding or Content-Type headers are present
    return False
```

This corrected function takes into account the presence of 'Content-Encoding: gzip' as well as handles the 'Content-Type' header with additional parameters such as 'charset'. It also provides a more comprehensive check for whether the response is gzipped or not.
