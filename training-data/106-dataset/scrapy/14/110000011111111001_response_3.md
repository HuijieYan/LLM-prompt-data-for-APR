The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `ctype` variable with the expected gzip content types. The `get` method for the `Content-Type` header returns the value as a list, not a single string which might lead to the incorrect comparison with the expected content types.

The bug occurred because the `response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')` returned a list with a single value instead of just the value. Subsequently, the comparison between `ctype` and the expected content types (`b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'`) was not matching due to the extra characters included.

To fix the bug, we need to extract the actual content type from the list returned by `response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')` and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', [b''])[0]
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```

By adding `[0]` after `response.headers.get('Content-Type', [b''])`, we are accessing the first (and presumably only) value in the list, which should be the actual content type. This will ensure that the comparison with the expected content types will work correctly.
