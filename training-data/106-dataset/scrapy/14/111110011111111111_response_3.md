The problem lies in the is_gzipped function, where it checks the Content-Type header for whether it matches 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'. In the test case, the Content-Type header is 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8', so the function returns False because it does not match exactly 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'.

The bug occurs because the function is_gzipped does not account for the case where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like 'charset=utf-8'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the is_gzipped function to check if the Content-Type includes 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' as part of the string, regardless of any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'application/x-gzip' in ctype or b'application/gzip' in ctype
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8' as gzipped, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
