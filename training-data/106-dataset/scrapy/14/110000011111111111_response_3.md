The bug in the `is_gzipped` function seems to be related to how it checks for the `Content-Type` header. In the provided test case, the `Content-Type` header includes the charset information, which the current implementation of the `is_gzipped` function does not account for. 

The function currently checks if the `Content-Type` header is exactly equal to `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, which does not allow for the presence of additional parameters, such as `charset=utf-8`. This results in the function returning `False` when it should actually return `True`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check if the `Content-Type` header starts with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, which will account for additional parameters like `charset=utf-8`.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype == b'application/gzip'
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify the `Content-Type: application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8` header as indicating a gzipped response, and the associated test case should pass without triggering an assertion error.
