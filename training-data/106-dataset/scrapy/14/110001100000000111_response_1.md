The potential error in the provided code is that it only checks for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, but it does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes 'charset'.

The bug occurs because the function is_gzipped does not handle cases where the Content-Type header includes 'charset'. As a result, it returns False when the Content-Type is 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the presence of 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, ignoring any 'charset' information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_14/scrapy/utils/gz.py

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
