The test case 'test_is_gzipped_with_charset' is checking whether the response is identified as gzipped when the 'Content-Type' header includes the charset parameter. The expected result is for the response to be identified as gzipped, but the actual result is False, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error location within the 'is_gzipped' function is in the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header. The function currently checks for an exact match of 'Content-Type' with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', which does not account for the presence of the charset parameter.

The bug occurs because the 'is_gzipped' function does not handle cases where the 'Content-Type' header includes additional parameters such as charset. As a result, it incorrectly identifies the response as not gzipped when charset is present in the 'Content-Type' header.

To fix the bug, the 'is_gzipped' function needs to be modified to consider the presence of additional parameters in the 'Content-Type' header. It should check for partial matches of the 'Content-Type' header value, ignoring any parameters such as charset.

Here's the corrected code for the 'is_gzipped' function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(ct in ctype for ct in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this modification, the 'is_gzipped' function now checks for partial matches of the 'Content-Type' header, allowing it to correctly identify the response as gzipped even when additional parameters like charset are present.
