The potential error in the `is_gzipped` function is with the content type check. The function checks if the content type is either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`. However, in the test case `test_is_gzipped_with_charset`, the content type includes the character set (`charset=utf-8`), which is not accounted for in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to account for the character set in the content type as well.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this correction, the `is_gzipped` function will correctly identify the content type as gzipped even if it includes a character set.
