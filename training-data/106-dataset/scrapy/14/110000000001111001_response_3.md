The bug in the provided function `is_gzipped` is that it only checks for exact matches of the Content-Type header for gzip files, which means it doesn't account for cases where the Content-Type header contains additional information such as the character set.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for partial matches of the Content-Type header.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```
