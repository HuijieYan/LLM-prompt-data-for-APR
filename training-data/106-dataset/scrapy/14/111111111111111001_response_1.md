The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the `Content-Type` header. The function is comparing the entire value of the `Content-Type` header with either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`. This comparison will fail because the `Content-Type` header also includes the character set (`charset=utf-8`). 

The reason for the bug is that the function is not properly handling the `charset` part of the `Content-Type` header, leading to a false comparison and the function returning `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header contains either `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, regardless of any additional parameters such as `charset`. We can achieve this by using the `startswith` method to check the start of the value of the `Content-Type` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

This change will accurately determine if the response is gzipped, regardless of the presence of any additional parameters in the `Content-Type` header.
