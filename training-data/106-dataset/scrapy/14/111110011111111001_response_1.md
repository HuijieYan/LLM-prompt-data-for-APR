The potential error location is in the `is_gzipped` function where it checks for the Content-Type in the response headers.

The reason for the bug is that the current implementation only checks for the exact Content-Type values of `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, but it should instead check if the Content-Type contains `gzip` in it.

To fix the bug, the `is_gzipped` function should be updated to check if the Content-Type contains the string `gzip`. Additionally, the `charset` part of the Content-Type should be removed before the comparison.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]
    return b'gzip' in ctype
```

With this correction, the `is_gzipped` function will correctly identify gzipped content types, regardless of additional parameters like `charset`. This should resolve the assertion error in the test case.
