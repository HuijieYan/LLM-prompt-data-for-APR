The bug is occurring because the function `is_gzipped` is checking for an exact match of the Content-Type header against `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`. However, the actual Content-Type header in the provided test case contains additional information `charset=utf-8`, causing the function to return False.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the Content-Type header starts with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, instead of checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'` as gzipped content and return True.
