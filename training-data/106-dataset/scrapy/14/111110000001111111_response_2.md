The error in the `is_gzipped` function is that it only checks for exact matches of the Content-Type header value with 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip'. This causes it to return False when the Content-Type includes additional parameters like 'charset=utf-8', as seen in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the header value starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', instead of an exact match. This way, it will correctly identify gzip content types regardless of additional parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

This modified function will now correctly identify the Content-Type as gzipped even when it includes additional parameters, such as 'charset=utf-8'.
