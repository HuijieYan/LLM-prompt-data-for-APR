Potential error location: 
The bug is likely in the comparison of content type values in the `is_gzipped` function.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison in the `is_gzipped` function is checking for content types `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'` but not `b'application/octet-stream'`, which is also a commonly used content type for gzip files.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We should update the function to check for `b'application/octet-stream'` as well to properly identify gzipped content.

Corrected code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip', b'application/octet-stream')
```
