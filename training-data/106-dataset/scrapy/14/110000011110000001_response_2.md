Potential Error:
The `is_gzipped` function is not correctly identifying a gzipped response when there is a charset included in the Content-Type header.

Reason for the Bug:
The `is_gzipped` function only checks if the Content-Type header is equal to 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip'. It does not handle cases where there is a charset included in the Content-Type header.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to handle cases where there may be additional parameters in the Content-Type header, such as 'charset'.

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    if b'application/x-gzip' in ctype or b'application/gzip' in ctype:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
