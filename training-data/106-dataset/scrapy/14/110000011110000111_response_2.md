The error occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for the exact content type 'application/x-gzip', but does not account for other variations such as 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'. This causes the function to return False when it encounters the variation in the Content-Type header.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to account for variations in the Content-Type header, specifically by checking if 'application/x-gzip' is present in the content type string, instead of checking for an exact match.

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return b'application/x-gzip' in ctype
```

By making this change, the function will correctly identify 'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8' as a gzipped content type, and the associated test case should pass without triggering an AssertionError.
