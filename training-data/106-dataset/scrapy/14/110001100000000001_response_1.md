Potential error location: The condition `return ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')` is not checking for the content encoding of the response.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is only checking the content type of the response, but not the content encoding. It should also check for the 'Content-Encoding' header to determine if the response is gzipped.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to also check the 'Content-Encoding' header for 'gzip'.
2. Add a check for the 'Content-Encoding' header before checking the 'Content-Type'.

Corrected code:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', b'')
    return encoding == b'gzip' or ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
```
