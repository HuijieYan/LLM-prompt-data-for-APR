Potential error location: 
The buggy function `is_gzipped` checks if the Content-Type header is equal to `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, and returns True if it matches. However, this approach does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters, such as `charset=utf-8`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the function only compares the Content-Type header to a fixed set of values without considering additional parameters. As a result, it returns False when the Content-Type includes parameters like `charset=utf-8`, even though the response is actually gzipped.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to check for the presence of `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` within the Content-Type header, regardless of additional parameters.
2. Use a library or built-in function to parse the Content-Type header and extract the media type without parameters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from http import cookies

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    media_type, _ = cgi.parse_header(ctype.decode('utf-8'))
    return media_type in ('application/x-gzip', 'application/gzip')
```

In the corrected code, the `cgi.parse_header` function is used to parse the Content-Type header and extract the media type without parameters. This allows the function to correctly identify gzipped content even when the Content-Type header includes additional parameters like `charset=utf-8`.
