The bug is occurring because the `is_gzipped` function is checking for an exact match of the `Content-Type` header with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`. However, in the provided test case, the `Content-Type` header includes the charset as well, resulting in `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'` instead of just `b'application/x-gzip'`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header contains `application/x-gzip` even if it includes additional parameters such as `charset`. This can be achieved by using the `in` operator to check for inclusion rather than exact matches.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return any(x in ctype for x in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'))
```

With this change, the function will correctly identify that the `Content-Type` header includes `application/x-gzip` and return `True` as expected. This fix will address the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
