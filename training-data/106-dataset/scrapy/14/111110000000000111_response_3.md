Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function is that it only checks for "application/x-gzip" and "application/gzip" in the Content-Type header, without considering any charset that may be included in the header.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is_gzipped only checks for specific content types (application/x-gzip and application/gzip) without considering additional parameters such as charset in the Content-Type header.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to check for the presence of "gzip" in the Content-Encoding header instead of relying solely on the Content-Type header.
2. Parse and compare the Content-Type header using a more robust method that considers additional parameters such as charset.
3. Utilize a library or built-in function for handling gzip check instead of implementing a custom solution.

Corrected code:

```python
import gzip

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', '')
    if 'gzip' in content_encoding:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
