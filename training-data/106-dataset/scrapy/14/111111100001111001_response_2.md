The buggy function `is_gzipped` checks if the response is gzipped by looking at the 'Content-Type' header. However, it doesn't handle cases where the 'Content-Type' header contains additional information such as the character encoding.

The bug occurs because the function is comparing the entire 'Content-Type' header value with a predefined set of gzipped content types. In this case, the 'Content-Type' header value includes the character encoding information, which causes the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the 'Content-Type' header starts with the gzipped content types, ignoring any additional information such as the character encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this modification, the function now checks if the 'Content-Type' header value starts with either 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', which allows it to handle cases where additional information is included in the header value.
