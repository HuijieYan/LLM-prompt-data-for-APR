The `is_gzipped` function checks if the response is gzipped based on the 'Content-Type' header. The bug in the function is that it only checks for specific content types ('application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip') and does not account for any additional parameters in the content type header.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the additional parameters in the content type header, such as 'charset=utf-8'. As a result, it does not accurately determine if the response is gzipped.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the content type starts with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', instead of an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this modification, the function will accurately check if the response is gzipped, regardless of any additional parameters in the 'Content-Type' header.
