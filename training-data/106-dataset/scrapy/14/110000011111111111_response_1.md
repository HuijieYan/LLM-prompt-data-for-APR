The bug is occurring because the `is_gzipped` function is checking for an exact match of the `Content-Type` header with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip`, but it is not taking into account the possibility of charset parameter in the `Content-Type` header.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to check if the `Content-Type` header starts with `application/x-gzip` or `application/gzip` instead of an exact match. This will allow the function to handle cases where the `Content-Type` header also includes a charset parameter.

Here's the corrected `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```

With this correction, the `is_gzipped` function will be able to handle cases where the `Content-Type` header includes a charset parameter, and the associated test case should pass without any issues.
