The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison `ctype in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')`. The bug is occurring because of the incorrect comparison of the Content-Type header. The Content-Type header in the test function is set to "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8", and the buggy function is checking for an exact match with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip".

To fix this bug, the Content-Type header should be checked for the presence of 'gzip', regardless of any additional parameters such as 'charset'. This can be achieved by using the `startswith` method to check if the Content-Type header starts with "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype.startswith(b'application/gzip')
```
