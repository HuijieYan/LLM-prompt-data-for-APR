The bug in the `is_gzipped` function is that it checks for an exact match of the content type with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'`, but does not handle cases where the content type might have additional parameters like `charset`. 

This bug occurs because the function checks for an exact match of the content type and does not handle any additional parameters in the content type.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the content type starts with `b'application/x-gzip'` or `b'application/gzip'` instead of checking for an exact match. This will allow the function to correctly identify gzipped content types with additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'').split(b';')[0]
    return ctype.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ctype == b'application/gzip'
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify gzipped content types with or without additional parameters.
