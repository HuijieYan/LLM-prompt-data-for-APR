Potential error location: The `is_gzipped` function is returning False even though the Content-Type header value matches one of the expected values (application/x-gzip) due to the presence of the charset in the header value.

Reasons behind the bug: The `is_gzipped` function only checks for the exact match of Content-Type header values with (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip'). It does not account for cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as charset.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `is_gzipped` function to check for the presence of 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header value, without considering other parameters.
2. Use a regular expression to match the Content-Type header value with the expected values, ignoring any additional parameters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    return re.match(b'application/(x-)?gzip', ctype) is not None
```

In the corrected code, the function uses a regular expression to match the Content-Type header value with 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip', while ignoring any additional parameters such as charset. This ensures that the function correctly identifies a gzipped response even when additional parameters are present in the Content-Type header.
