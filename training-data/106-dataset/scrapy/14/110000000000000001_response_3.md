Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given function is with the comparison of the 'Content-Type' header. The function is checking for the 'Content-Type' header to be either 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' to identify if the response is gzipped.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'Content-Type' header for a gzipped response is usually 'application/gzip' or 'application/x-gzip', but it can also be 'application/octet-stream' in some cases. Therefore, the function only checking for 'application/x-gzip' and 'application/gzip' will not cover all possible cases of a gzipped response.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for 'Content-Encoding' header instead of 'Content-Type' header. Gzipped responses are typically encoded with gzip, so checking the 'Content-Encoding' header would cover all cases of gzipped responses.

Corrected Code:
```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    encoding = response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', '')
    return 'gzip' in encoding
```
