1. The test case is checking if the `is_gzipped` function returns True when the Content-Type header includes a charset, specifically "application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8". However, the function returns False in this case, leading to an AssertionError in the test.

2. The potential error location within the `is_gzipped` function is the comparison of the Content-Type header with a tuple of known gzipped types.

3. The bug occurs because the `is_gzipped` function only checks for the presence of "application/x-gzip" or "application/gzip" in the Content-Type header, but it does not account for the possibility of a charset being included in the header.

4. To fix the bug, the `is_gzipped` function needs to be updated to handle Content-Type headers with a charset included. One approach is to modify the function to extract the actual content type and then check if it matches any of the known gzipped types, regardless of whether a charset is included.

5. Below is the corrected `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    content_type = response.headers.get('Content-Type', b'')
    type_parts = content_type.split(b';')  # Split content type and charset if present
    actual_type = type_parts[0].strip()
    return actual_type in (b'application/x-gzip', b'application/gzip')
``` 

In the corrected function, the Content-Type header is split at the semicolon if present, and then the actual content type is extracted from the first part. This actual content type is then checked against the known gzipped types to determine if the response is gzipped.
