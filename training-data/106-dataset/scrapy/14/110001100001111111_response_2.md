The issue is with the `is_gzipped` function not correctly identifying `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'` as a gzipped content type, causing it to return False.

The reason for this bug is that the `is_gzipped` function only checks for exact matches of `b'application/x-gzip'` and `b'application/gzip'`, and does not take into account cases where the Content-Type header includes additional parameters such as `charset=utf-8`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `is_gzipped` function to check for the presence of 'application/x-gzip' or 'application/gzip' in the Content-Type header, regardless of any additional parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_gzipped` function:

```python
def is_gzipped(response):
    """Return True if the response is gzipped, or False otherwise"""
    ctype = response.headers.get(b'Content-Type', b'')
    return any(ct.startswith(b'application/x-gzip') or ct.startswith(b'application/gzip') for ct in ctype)
```

This modification will now correctly identify `b'application/x-gzip;charset=utf-8'` as a gzipped content type and return True as expected.
