The error message indicates an AttributeError caused by attempting to use the `extend` method on a string object. This is likely occurring in the send method of the MailSender class, specifically when handling the cc parameter.

The bug occurs because the cc parameter is expected to be a list, but in the test case, it is passed as a string. This causes the rcpts.extend(cc) line to fail as strings do not have the extend method.

To fix this bug, the send method needs to be modified to handle the cc parameter correctly. If cc is a string, it should be converted to a list with a single element. If cc is already a list, it can be used as is.

Here's the corrected code for the send method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to[:]
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):
            rcpts.append(cc)  # Convert the cc string to a list with a single element
        else:
            rcpts.extend(cc)
        msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join([cc] if isinstance(cc, str) else cc)  # Set the Cc header accordingly

    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)

    # The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the send method can handle the cc parameter correctly and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
