The error in the function can be inferred from the provided test case. The problematic line of code is likely to be in the section where the message is constructed and attached with the MIME type. The error seems to be related to the 'msg' variable being assigned a value of 'MIMENonMultipart' object when there are attachments, instead of 'MIMEMultipart'. This is likely causing issues with attaching the attachments properly to the email.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of attachment MIME types in the function. When there are attachments, the function should create a MIMEMultipart object to handle the attachments. However, the code incorrectly assigns a MIMENonMultipart object to 'msg' when attachments are present.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to refactor the code to correctly handle the creation of the message object based on the presence of attachments. Additionally, the code should ensure that the attachments are processed and attached to the message object properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email import encoders

def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMEText(body, mimetype, charset)

    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(to)
    
    if cc:
        msg['Cc'] = ', '.join(cc)

    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    if attachs:
        for attach_name, attach_mimetype, f in attachs:
            part = MIMEBase(*attach_mimetype.split('/'))
            part.set_payload(f.read())
            encoders.encode_base64(part)
            part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename=attach_name)
            msg.attach(part)

    if _callback:
        _callback(to=to, subject=subject, body=body, cc=cc, attach=attachs, msg=msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
