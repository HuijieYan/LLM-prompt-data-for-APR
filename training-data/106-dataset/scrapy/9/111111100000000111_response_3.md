Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is in the condition where the `if` statement checks if `attachs` is not empty. If it is empty, the function attempts to create a `MIMENonMultipart` object with the `mimetype` provided, which may not be valid.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to check if `attachs` is not empty is not properly handled. This causes the function to attempt to create a `MIMENonMultipart` object with incorrect input when `attachs` is empty.

Approach to Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the condition for when `attachs` is empty.

Corrected Code:
```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        for attach in attachs:
            attach_name, attach_mimetype, f = attach
            part = MIMEBase(*attach_mimetype.split('/'))
            part.set_payload(f.read())
            Encoders.encode_base64(part)
            part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="%s"' % attach_name)
            msg.attach(part)
    else:
        msg = MIMEText(body, mimetype, charset or 'us-ascii')

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```
In the corrected code, when `attachs` is not empty, we properly handle the attachments by iterating through each attachment and creating the necessary MIME object for each one. When `attachs` is empty, we create a `MIMEText` object with the `mimetype` and `charset` provided.
