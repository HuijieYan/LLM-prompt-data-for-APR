The test case `test_send_single_values_to_and_cc` is attempting to call the `send` method of the `MailSender` class, passing the parameters `to`, `subject`, `body`, `cc`, and `_callback`. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError occurring at line 57 of `scrapy/mail.py`. This is likely related to the usage of the `extend` method on a string object. It seems that the `cc` parameter is being passed as a string, causing the error when trying to extend it.

The reason behind the bug is that the parameter `cc` should be passed as a list, not a string. This is because the `extend` method is used to add elements from one list (or another iterable) to the end of the current list, and it is not applicable to strings.

To fix the bug, the `cc` parameter should be explicitly converted to a list if it is not already a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to[:]
    
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):
            cc = [cc]  # Convert cc to a list if it's a string
        rcpts.extend(cc)
        msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join(cc)

    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)

    # ... (omitted code)

    if _callback:
        _callback(to=to, subject=subject, body=body, cc=cc, attach=attachs, msg=msg)

    # ... (omitted code)

    # Return or process the result accordingly
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `cc` is provided and if it's a string. If it's a string, we convert it into a list before extending `rcpts`. This should resolve the AttributeError that was occurring.
