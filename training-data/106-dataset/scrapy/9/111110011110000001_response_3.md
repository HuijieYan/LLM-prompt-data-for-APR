The error message shows that there is an AttributeError related to the 'extend' method being called on a string object. This indicates that the `cc` parameter is being treated as a string instead of a list.

The issue is occurring in the `send` method, specifically when dealing with the `cc` parameter. It is assumed that `cc` is a list, which is why the `extend` method is being called on it.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `cc` parameter is always treated as a list, even if only one email address is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `send` method:

```python
def send(self, to, subject, body, cc=None, attachs=(), mimetype='text/plain', charset=None, _callback=None):
    if attachs:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
    else:
        msg = MIMENonMultipart(*mimetype.split('/', 1))
    msg['From'] = self.mailfrom
    msg['To'] = COMMASPACE.join(to)
    msg['Date'] = formatdate(localtime=True)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    rcpts = to[:]
    
    if cc:
        if isinstance(cc, str):
            rcpts.append(cc)
            cc = [cc]
            msg['Cc'] = cc[0]
        else:
            rcpts.extend(cc)
            msg['Cc'] = COMMASPACE.join(cc)
    
    if charset:
        msg.set_charset(charset)
    
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```
