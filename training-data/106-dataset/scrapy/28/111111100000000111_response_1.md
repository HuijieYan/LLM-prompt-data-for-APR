Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the given function is with the opening of the file. If the file path is given, the function tries to open the file 'requests.seen' for appending (`a+`). However, the file is not closed after opening.


Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the file is opened but not closed after reading the existing fingerprints from the file. This can lead to potential problems such as file descriptor leaks and resource usage issues.


Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Open the file using a context manager to ensure that the file is automatically closed after the operation is complete.
2. Handle any potential file operation errors using exception handling.


```python
# Corrected function with fix
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while opening the file: {e}")
```
