The error occurs in the test_dupefilter_path test function. It tries to create two RFPDupeFilter instances with the same path and then checks if the requests are seen or not. However, the second RFPDupeFilter instance should not have seen the request r1, but it did according to the assertion error.

The bug in the code is caused by the initialization of the self.fingerprints variable. When the path is provided, the code opens the 'requests.seen' file and updates the fingerprints set with the values from the file. This means that every time an instance of RFPDupeFilter is created with the same path, it reads the 'requests.seen' file, and updates the fingerprints set with the data from it. Hence, when creating the second instance, the fingerprints set already contains the data from the first instance, leading to incorrect duplicate checks.

To fix this bug, we can update the code to read the existing fingerprints from the file only when the file is not empty.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path) and os.path.getsize(file_path) > 0:
                self.file = open(file_path, 'r+')
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
                self.file.close()

    def open(self):
        if self.file is None:
            file_path = os.path.join(self.path, 'requests.seen')
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')

    def request_seen(self, request):
        # implementation of request_seen method
        pass

    def close(self, reason):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the file exists and is not empty before reading its contents into the fingerprints set. This prevents the set from being populated with data from previous instances when the dupe filter is reinitialized with the same path.

This should resolve the issue in the test case.
