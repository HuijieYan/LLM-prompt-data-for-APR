Potential error location: Line 18, where the open() function is being used to open a file and update the fingerprints in the set.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug could be that the file is not being properly closed after being opened, leading to issues with writing to and updating the file.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a try/finally block to ensure that the file is properly closed after it has been opened.
2. Use a with statement to automatically close the file after it has been opened.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
            self.file = file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
