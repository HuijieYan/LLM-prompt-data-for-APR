The potential error in the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is that the `open` method is not called to open the file before checking for duplicates in the `fingerprint` set.

The error occurs because the file is not opened before checking for duplicates in the fingerprints set. As a result, the `assert df2.request_seen(r1)` is failing because the fingerprints set has not been updated with the contents of the opened file.

To fix this bug, the `open` method should be called after the `RFPDupeFilter` is created, and the fingerprints should be updated with the contents of the opened file.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import logging
import os

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
            self.open()

    def open(self):
        if not self.file.closed:
            self.file.close()
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')

    def request_seen(self, request):
        fp = request.fingerprint()
        if fp in self.fingerprints:
            return True
        self.fingerprints.add(fp)
        self.file.write(fp + os.linesep)
        return False

    def close(self, reason):
        self.file.close()
```

In this corrected code, the `open` method is added to open the file, and the `request_seen` method is modified to update the fingerprints set and write to the file when a request is seen. Additionally, the `close` method is included to close the file after it's no longer needed.
