Based on the provided information, the issue with the `__init__` function in the `RFPDupeFilter` class is that it is not properly reading the existing lines from the file and adding them to the set of fingerprints. This is resulting in the set of fingerprints not being initialized correctly.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `__init__` function to properly read the existing lines from the file and initialize the set of fingerprints. Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
                self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
            else:
                self.file = open(file_path, 'w')
```

In this corrected code, we check if the file exists at the given path. If it exists, we read the existing lines from the file and initialize the set of fingerprints. If the file does not exist, we create a new file at the path. This approach ensures that the set of fingerprints is initialized correctly based on the existing data in the file.

This fix should address the issue with the `__init__` function in the `RFPDupeFilter` class.
