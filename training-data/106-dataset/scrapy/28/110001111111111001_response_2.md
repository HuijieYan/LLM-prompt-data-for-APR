The error occurs when the test function tries to check if the `df2` instance of `RFPDupeFilter` has seen the request `r1` even though it should not have seen it. This suggests that the `request_seen` method is not functioning as expected, possibly due to the `fingerprints` not being updated correctly.

The bug is caused by the `__init__` function of the `RFPDupeFilter` class. It fails to update the `fingerprints` set with the data in the file when an existing `path` is provided.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function should properly open the file and update the `fingerprints` set to include the existing data in the file.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import os
import logging

class RFPDupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file)
            self.file = open(file_path, 'a+')
```

This corrected implementation properly updates the `fingerprints` set with the existing data from the file when the `path` is provided. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test.
