The test case `test_dupefilter_path` creates two instances of `RFPDupeFilter` and checks if the requests have been seen or not. The error occurs during the test when it asserts `df2.request_seen(r1)`.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class.

The bug in the `__init__` method is that it opens the file and reads the contents into the `self.fingerprints` set, but it does not reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file. This causes the file pointer to be at the end of the file when trying to read the contents into the set, resulting in an empty set.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file after reading its contents into the set.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
        self.file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning
        self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
