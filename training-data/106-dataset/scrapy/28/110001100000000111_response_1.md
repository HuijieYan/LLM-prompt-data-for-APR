Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is that `os` and `logging` modules are not imported, and `open` function is used without closing the file.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurred due to missing import statements for the `os` and `logging` modules, as well as not closing the file after opening it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary `os` and `logging` modules.
2. Use a context manager (e.g., `with open(...) as file`) to ensure the file is properly closed after its use.

Corrected code:

```python
import logging
import os

class DupeFilter:
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            with open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+') as file:
                self.file = file
                self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
