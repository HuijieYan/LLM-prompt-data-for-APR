The error occurs when the test function tries to check if the `RFPDupeFilter` has seen a request, and it fails the assertion. This indicates that the `request_seen` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class is the lines:
```python
self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.file` is opened in append mode ('a+'), which does not position the file pointer at the beginning of the file. When trying to read the content of the file into `self.fingerprints`, it only reads from the end of the file and therefore does not retrieve the correct content.

To fix this bug, the file pointer needs to be reset to the beginning of the file before reading its content.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `RFPDupeFilter` class:

```python
import os
import logging
from w3lib.url import canonicalize_url
from scrapy.dupefilters import BaseDupeFilter
from scrapy.http import Request
import shutil
import tempfile

class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            requests_seen_file = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
            if os.path.exists(requests_seen_file):
                with open(requests_seen_file, 'r') as file:
                    self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in file.readlines())
            self.file = open(requests_seen_file, 'a+')
