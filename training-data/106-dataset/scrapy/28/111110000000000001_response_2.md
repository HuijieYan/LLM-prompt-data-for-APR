Potential Error Location: The problem lies in the line `self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)`. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to update the fingerprints set with the lines read from the file, but the file has been opened in append mode ('a+'), so the file pointer is at the end of the file and there are no lines to be read.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, we need to seek to the beginning of the file before reading its contents.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RFPDupeFilter(BaseDupeFilter):
    """
    Request Fingerprint duplicates filter
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
        self.file = None
        self.fingerprints = set()
        self.logdupes = True
        self.debug = debug
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        if path:
            self.file = open(os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen'), 'a+')
            self.file.seek(0)  # seek to the beginning of the file
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
