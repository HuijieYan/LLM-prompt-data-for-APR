The potential error in the given code is that the file is not being closed after it has been opened. This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues with file handling.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the file is closed after it has been opened using the `with` statement. This will automatically close the file after the block of code is executed.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
import os

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, path=None, debug=False):
    self.file = None
    self.fingerprints = set()
    self.logdupes = True
    self.debug = debug
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    if path:
        file_path = os.path.join(path, 'requests.seen')
        with open(file_path, 'a+') as f:
            self.file = f
            self.fingerprints.update(x.rstrip() for x in self.file)
```
