Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the line `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"`. If the `request.headers` is empty, this line will cause an error because the `to_string()` method will not exist for a NoneType.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `request.headers` may be empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking if `request.headers` is not None before trying to access the `to_string()` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += b"\r\n" + request.body
    return s
```
