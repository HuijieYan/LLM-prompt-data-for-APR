The potential error in the function is that it is using the `urlparse_cached` method without importing it. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the `urlparse_cached` method needs to be imported. The `urllib.parse` module should be imported as well to access the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` methods.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import urllib.parse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(request.url)
    path = urllib.parse.urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
