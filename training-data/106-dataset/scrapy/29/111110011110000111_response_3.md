The error message indicates a TypeError within the `to_bytes` method when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes. This means that `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the `request_httprepr` function is the line:
```
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
This line is trying to concatenate the "Host" header with the value of `parsed.hostname` after converting it to bytes using the `to_bytes` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and the `to_bytes` method does not handle `None` values.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from six import string_types

def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` before trying to convert it to bytes. If `parsed.hostname` exists, then it will be added to the raw HTTP representation; otherwise, it will be skipped.
