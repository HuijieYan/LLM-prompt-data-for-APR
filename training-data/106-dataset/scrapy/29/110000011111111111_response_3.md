The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` as input, which is causing the `TypeError`. This is likely happening because `parsed.hostname` is becoming `None` due to the absence of a hostname in the parsed URL.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for the `Host` header in the HTTP representation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.http.headers import Headers
from urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse


def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before adding it to the HTTP representation. If `parsed.hostname` exists, the `Host` header is added to the representation. If it does not, the `Host` header is omitted. This change ensures that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `NoneType` as input.
