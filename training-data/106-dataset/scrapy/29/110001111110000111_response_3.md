Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` within the `request_httprepr` function.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` as it expects a valid string, not a `NoneType`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes.
2. Provide a default value for the host if `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
3. Handle the `None` case gracefully, for example by setting `parsed.hostname` to a default value.

Corrected Code:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse as urlparse_cached, urlunparse
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

# Test function for the corrected code
def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
    # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
    request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
    request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
