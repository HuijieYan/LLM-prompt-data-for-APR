The potential error in the provided code is with the `urlparse_cached` and `urlunparse` functions, which are not defined within the code snippet. Additionally, the `to_bytes` function is not defined either.

The code is attempting to use these undefined functions to parse the request's URL, extract the path and headers, and then construct the raw HTTP representation. As a result, it's unable to produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, the undefined functions `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, and `to_bytes` need to be imported or implemented within the code. Once these functions are defined, the `request_httprepr` function should work correctly to generate the raw HTTP representation.

The corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function is provided below, assuming the necessary functions are defined or imported:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import io

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode('utf-8') + b" " + path.encode('utf-8') + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += io.BytesIO(request.headers) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
