Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the code is at the line containing `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"`. It seems like the `request.headers` might not have a `to_string()` method, which is causing the error.

Reason behind the Bug:
The error is occurring because the `request.headers` object does not have a `to_string()` method, and the code is attempting to call this method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the `request.headers` object has a method to convert it to a string, and if not, then manually construct the string representation of the headers.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse
import requests

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = request.method.encode() + b" " + path.encode() + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed.hostname.encode() + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        headers_str = ''.join([f"{header}:{value}\r\n" for header, value in request.headers.items()])
        s += headers_str.encode()
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
