The error message "TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType" indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object, causing the error. The error occurs at this line: `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

The reason for this bug is that the `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https'. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError because it expects a string, not `None`.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can use the `netloc` attribute from the parsed URL instead of `hostname` to get the host information.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By using `parsed.netloc` instead of `parsed.hostname`, we can avoid the `None` error when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https'.
