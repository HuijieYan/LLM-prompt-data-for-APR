Potential error location:
The potential error is likely in the line `parsed = urlparse_cached(request)` as the `urlparse_cached` function is not a built-in Python function and is not defined within the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is occurring because `urlparse_cached` is not a valid function. This function is likely a custom function or part of an external package that needs to be imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `urlparse_cached` is a custom function, it needs to be defined in the code or imported from an external package.
2. If it is part of an external package, the package needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_29/scrapy/utils/request.py
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached, to_bytes
from urllib.parse import urlunparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
