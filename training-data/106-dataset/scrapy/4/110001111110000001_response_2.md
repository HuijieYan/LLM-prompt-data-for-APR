The error message suggests an AttributeError occurring in the `TracebackException` class when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`.

The potential error location within the `_clean_req` function is the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically when accessing the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc_value.__cause__` may not have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `eb_wrapper` function should be modified to handle the case where `exc_value.__cause__` may not have a `__traceback__` attribute. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the code does not encounter any unexpected exceptions by wrapping the relevant sections with try-except blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, getattr(failure, '__traceback__', None))
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, we handle the `__traceback__` attribute by using the `getattr` function to retrieve it if it exists or default to `None` otherwise. Additionally, the `cb_wrapper` is wrapped in a try-except block to handle any exceptions and record errors accordingly.
