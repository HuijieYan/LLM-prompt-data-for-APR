The error message is an AttributeError that occurs within the eb_wrapper function of the _clean_req method of the ContractsManager class, specifically at this line:
exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the exc_value object is a method that does not have a __traceback__ attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the eb_wrapper function within the _clean_req method of the ContractsManager class to handle the case where exc_value does not have a __traceback__ attribute. We also need to ensure that the error information is properly added to the results.

Here's the corrected code for the _clean_req method:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # other class methods and attributes...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
            if hasattr(failure.value, '__cause__') and failure.value.__cause__ is not None:
                exc_info = (failure.value.__cause__, type(failure.value.__cause__), failure.value.__cause__.__traceback__)
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, we've added "import sys" to import the sys module. Additionally, we've modified the exception handling in the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions to properly capture and handle exceptions. We've also included a check for the presence of a __cause__ attribute in the eb_wrapper function. If the __cause__ attribute exists and is not None, we handle it properly by extracting the relevant information.

These changes should address the AttributeError issue and ensure that error information is added to the results.
