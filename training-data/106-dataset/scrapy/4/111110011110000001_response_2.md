The error occurs when `request.errback(failure_mock)` is called in the `test_errback` function. It seems to be related to the `eb_wrapper` function in the `ContractsManager` class where the `results.addError` is being called with `exc_info`.

The bug occurs because the `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` is not correctly constructed. The `exc_info` should be a tuple of type, value, and traceback, but it is not being constructed properly in the `eb_wrapper` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `eb_wrapper` function to correctly construct the `exc_info` tuple and ensure that it contains the type, value, and traceback of the exception.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps
from twisted.python import failure

class ContractsManager(object):

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        pass

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        pass

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With this correction, the `eb_wrapper` function now correctly constructs the `exc_info` tuple using the type, value, and traceback of the failure, and then passes it to `results.addError`. This should fix the error occurring in the test case.
