The bug is likely located in the `eb_wrapper` function, as indicated by the error message. The error message states: "results.addError(case, exc_info)", suggesting that the error is related to the 'exc_info' object. The 'exc_info' object is a tuple containing information about the exception, which includes the exception type, exception value, and traceback.

The error message specifically mentions AttributeError related to the '__traceback__' attribute, which indicates that there might be an issue with accessing the traceback object within the 'exc_info' tuple.

The bug is likely occurring because the 'exc_info' tuple is not constructed correctly, leading to the AttributeError when accessing the traceback object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct exception information is captured in the 'exc_info' tuple. One way to achieve this is by using sys.exc_info() to capture the exception information. Additionally, we need to modify the 'cb_wrapper' function to properly handle exceptions and store the correct results in the 'results' object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code:
- We added an import statement for the 'sys' module to use the 'sys.exc_info()' function.
- The 'cb_wrapper' function now properly handles exceptions using a try-except block and captures the exception information using 'sys.exc_info()'.
- In the 'eb_wrapper' function, we modified the 'exc_info' tuple to capture the exception information from the 'failure' object using 'failure.value', 'failure.type', and 'failure.getTracebackObject()', assuming that 'failure' object provides these attributes.

With these modifications, the bug related to the AttributeError when accessing the '__traceback__' attribute should be resolved.
