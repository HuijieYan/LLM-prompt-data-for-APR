The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the __traceback__ attribute. This usually occurs when trying to access the __traceback__ attribute of an object that does not have it, resulting in an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `eb_wrapper` function:
```
exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
```
This line is trying to access the __traceback__ attribute of the `failure` object, which is likely causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the `failure` object and its attributes appropriately.

Additionally, the `cb_wrapper` function should be modified to handle exceptions in a manner similar to the `eb_wrapper` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def cb_wrapper(self, cb):
        @wraps(cb)
        def wrapped_cb(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        return wrapped_cb

    def eb_wrapper(self, failure, method, results):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.value.__class__, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ Stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
        request.callback = self.cb_wrapper(cb)
        request.errback = lambda failure: self.eb_wrapper(failure, method, results)
```
