The error occurs when calling request.errback(failure_mock) in the test function. This leads to an AttributeError in the eb_wrapper function of the ContractsManager class. The AttributeError occurs when trying to access exc_info.__cause__.__traceback__ inside the eb_wrapper function.

The reason for the AttributeError is that the failure value passed to the function does not contain a valid traceback attribute.

To fix the bug, the code in the eb_wrapper function must be modified to handle the failure correctly. Instead of trying to access exc_info.__cause__.__traceback__, it's better to handle the failure using built-in methods provided by the failure object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from twisted.python import failure

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code:
- The failure is being handled using the better-suited failure.getTracebackObject() method, which returns a valid traceback object.
- The exception handling is updated to catch specific exceptions (in this case, the generic Exception class is used, but it can be made more specific if needed).
- The try-except block in the cb_wrapper function is used to catch any exceptions that might occur during the callback execution.

These changes should address the AttributeError and handle the failure appropriately, ensuring that the traceback object is accessed correctly.
