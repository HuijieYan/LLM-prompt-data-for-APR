The potential error in the `_clean_req` function is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` are defined as nested functions within the `_clean_req` method, but they are not being used properly.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not being accessed correctly. Inside the method, the `@wraps(cb)` decorator is being used for `cb_wrapper`, but after that, the `cb_wrapper` is not being called. Similarly, `eb_wrapper` is defined but not being assigned or called in the method.

To fix the bug, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` need to be properly utilized within the method to ensure that they are called when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
        
        def _create_testcase(method, type):
            # implementation of _create_testcase method
            pass

        request.addCallback(cb_wrapper)
        request.addErrback(eb_wrapper)
```

In the corrected code, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are properly called using `addCallback` and `addErrback` on the `request` object. This ensures that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are used as intended. Additionally, the `_create_testcase` function is also defined within the `_clean_req` method.
