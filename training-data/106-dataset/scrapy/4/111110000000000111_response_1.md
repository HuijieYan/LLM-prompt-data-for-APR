Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the eb_wrapper function, specifically in the line "exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The AttributeError is likely happening because the getTracebackObject method is not available in the failure object, leading to the 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__' error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of using the getTracebackObject method, we can use the getTraceback method to retrieve the traceback information from the failure object.

Corrected code:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTraceback()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
