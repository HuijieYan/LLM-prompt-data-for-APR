The error message from the test function indicates an AttributeError occurring in the eb_wrapper function. Looking at the code, the eb_wrapper function tries to access the __traceback__ attribute of the exception object, which results in the AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the eb_wrapper function, specifically the line that attempts to access the __traceback__ attribute of the exception.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the exception object does not have a __traceback__ attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the eb_wrapper function should be modified to handle the exception object without trying to access the __traceback__ attribute. Instead, it can directly use the exc_info variable passed to it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the eb_wrapper function:
```python
def eb_wrapper(failure):
    case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
    exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
    results.addError(case, exc_info)
```

By storing the exception information from the failure object into the exc_info variable and passing it to the addError method, we avoid the AttributeError and handle the exception properly.
