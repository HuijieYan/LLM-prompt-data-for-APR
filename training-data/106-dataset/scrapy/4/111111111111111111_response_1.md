The error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method. This error happens because the `exc_info` variable is not being extracted properly from the `failure` object.

To fix this bug, modify the `eb_wrapper` function to properly extract the `exc_info` from the `failure` object and pass it to the `results.addError` method. Then update the `request.errback` to use the updated `eb_wrapper` function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With this fix, the `eb_wrapper` function correctly extracts the `exc_info` from the `failure` object, and the corrected `eb_wrapper` is assigned to the `request.errback`. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue experienced in the test case and described in the GitHub issue.
