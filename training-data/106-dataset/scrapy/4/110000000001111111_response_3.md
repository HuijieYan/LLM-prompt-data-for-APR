The bug is likely to occur in the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically with the `exc_info` variable. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the `__traceback__` attribute, which is likely caused by incorrect handling of the exception information.

The bug occurs because the `exc_info` variable is being set incorrectly in the `eb_wrapper` function, leading to the AttributeError. This is likely due to mishandling of the failure object and its attributes when adding the error to the results.

To fix this bug, the `eb_wrapper` function needs to correctly handle the failure object and set the `exc_info` attribute, corresponding to the `addError` method. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the exception's traceback is properly handled to prevent the `AttributeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTraceback()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, the `exc_info` is now set using `failure.value`, `failure.type`, and `failure.getTraceback()` to ensure correct exception information is added to the results without causing an AttributeError.
