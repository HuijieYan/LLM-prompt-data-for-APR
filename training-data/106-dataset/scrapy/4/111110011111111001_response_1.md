The error message and the test case indicate an issue related to the `eb_wrapper` function and the `exc_info` variable. It seems that the `exc_info` variable is not being assigned a valid value, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The potential error location within the `eb_wrapper` function is the assignment of `exc_info` using the `failure.value`, `failure.type`, and `failure.getTracebackObject()`.

The bug occurs because the `failure.getTracebackObject()` is attempting to access the `__traceback__` attribute on a `getset_descriptor` object, which is not valid and leads to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that valid traceback information is obtained to be used in the `exc_info` variable. One approach could be to use the `traceback.format_exception` method to retrieve the exception information as a string and store it in the `exc_info` variable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import traceback  # Add the traceback module import at the beginning of the file

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = traceback.format_exception(failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

By using the `traceback.format_exception` method, we ensure that valid traceback information is obtained and stored in the `exc_info` variable for later use. This should address the `AttributeError` encountered during the test case execution.
