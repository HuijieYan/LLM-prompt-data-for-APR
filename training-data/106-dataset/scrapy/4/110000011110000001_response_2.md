The error seems to be related to the AttributeError: 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__' in the eb_wrapper method.

The bug is likely occurring because the failure object does not have the attribute __traceback__, which is being accessed in the eb_wrapper method. This is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the eb_wrapper method to handle the failure object without accessing the __traceback__ attribute. We can also add additional error handling to handle cases where the failure object does not have __traceback__ attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the _clean_req function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            exc_info = sys.exc_info()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

By handling the exception explicitly and capturing the exc_info using sys.exc_info(), and modifying the way exc_info is gathered for failure in eb_wrapper, the issue related to AttributeError should be resolved.
