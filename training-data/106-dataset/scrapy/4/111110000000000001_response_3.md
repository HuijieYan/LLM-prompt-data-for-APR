Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are defined within the `_clean_req` method but are not called. This means that the `request.callback` and `request.errback` are being assigned to the wrapper functions but the functions themselves are not invoked, so the original callback and errback functions are not being executed.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the wrapper functions `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` are defined but not invoked. This results in the original callback and errback not being executed, leading to unexpected behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions should be invoked after they are assigned to `request.callback` and `request.errback`, respectively.

Corrected code:
```python
from functools import wraps 

class ContractsManager(object):
    
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper

        # Call the wrapper functions after assigning them
        cb_wrapper(request)
        eb_wrapper(request)
```
