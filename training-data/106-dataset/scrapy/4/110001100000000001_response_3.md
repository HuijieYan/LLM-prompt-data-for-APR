Potential error location: 
The error may be occurring because the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not returning anything. Also, the `cb` and `eb` variables are not being used within the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions.

Reason behind the bug:
The `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not returning anything, and the `cb` and `eb` variables are not being used. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions to return the `output` and `exc_info` respectively.
2. Use the `cb` and `eb` variables within the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions.

Corrected code:
```python
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
