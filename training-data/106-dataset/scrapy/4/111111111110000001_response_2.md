The error message indicates that the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class is encountering an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value.__cause__` object.

The potential error location is within the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically at the following line:
```python
exc_traceback = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
```

The reason for the bug is that the `failure.getTracebackObject()` method likely returns a descriptor object that does not have an attribute `__traceback__`, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access it.

The possible approach to fix the bug is to use the `getTraceback()` method of the `failure` object, which returns the traceback associated with the failure.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

# Other imports...

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTraceback()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

The above code replaces `failure.getTracebackObject()` with `failure.getTraceback()` in the `eb_wrapper` function, which should resolve the `AttributeError` issue.
