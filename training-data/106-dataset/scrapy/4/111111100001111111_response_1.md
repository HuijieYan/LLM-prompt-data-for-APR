The issue is likely occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class. The error message "AttributeError: 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__'" suggests that there is an issue with accessing the `__traceback__` attribute.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the `exc_info` tuple being passed to `results.addError` inside the `eb_wrapper` function does not contain the expected traceback information, resulting in the AttributeError when attempting to access `__traceback__`.

To fix this issue, the `eb_wrapper` function should be modified to extract the traceback information using the `sys.exc_info` function. This will ensure that the `exc_info` tuple passed to `results.addError` contains the required traceback information.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys  # Import the sys module to access sys.exc_info

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())  # Include traceback information
        
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = sys.exc_info()  # Obtain the traceback information using sys.exc_info
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With this correction, the `eb_wrapper` function now uses `sys.exc_info` to obtain the required traceback information, ensuring that the `exc_info` tuple passed to `results.addError` contains the necessary attributes. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
