The error is likely occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function of the `_clean_req` method within the `ContractsManager` class. The error is likely due to an issue with the `addError` method of the `results` object, which is not handling the `exc_info` properly.

The `eb_wrapper` function is supposed to handle errors and add them to the `results` object, but it seems to be encountering an attribute error due to a problem with the `exc_info` object. It is likely that the `exc_info` object is not being handled correctly when passed to the `results.addError` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `exc_info` object is passed correctly to the `results.addError` method within the `eb_wrapper` function. We can also make sure that the `results` object is properly initialized and handled within the `_clean_req` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and record any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `exc_info` object is passed correctly to the `results.addError` method within the `eb_wrapper` function. This should resolve the attribute error and ensure that errors are properly handled and recorded.
