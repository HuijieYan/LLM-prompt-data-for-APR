The error message indicates an `AttributeError` within the `eb_wrapper` function of the `ContractsManager` class. This error occurs while adding an error to the result using `results.addError(case, exc_info)`. The `exc_info` being passed to `addError` includes `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__`, which is causing the `AttributeError`.

The potential error location is the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class. The `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` is likely to be the source of the `AttributeError`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `exc_info` seems to be attempting to access `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`, but `exc_value.__cause__` may not have the `__traceback__` attribute. This is causing the `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we can handle the `exc_info` creation and addition to `results` in a way that does not rely on the `__traceback__` attribute, as it may not be available in all cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _create_testcase(method, desc):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def cb_wrapper(response):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def eb_wrapper(failure):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def cb_wrapper(response):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, we modified the `eb_wrapper` function to handle creating `exc_info` by passing `failure.value`, `type(failure.value)`, and calling `failure.getTracebackObject()` instead of directly accessing `failure.value.__traceback__`. This ensures that the `__traceback__` attribute is handled correctly.
