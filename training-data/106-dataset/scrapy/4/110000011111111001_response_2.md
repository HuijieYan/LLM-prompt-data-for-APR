The error occurs when the `request.errback` method is called with the `failure_mock` object. This triggers the `eb_wrapper` function which is supposed to add an error to the `results` object. However, there is an `AttributeError` being encountered during the execution of the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value.__cause__` object.

This bug is likely occurring due to the `failure_mock` object not containing the expected traceback information, causing the `__traceback__` attribute to be accessed erroneously.

To fix the bug, the `eb_wrapper` function should be modified to handle `failure_mock` objects appropriately to avoid the `AttributeError` and properly add error information to the `results` object.

The corrected code for the `_clean_req` function is as follows:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and record any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (type(e), e, e.__traceback__))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info) if failure.getTracebackObject() else results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

By modifying the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the `failure_mock` object correctly and adding an error in case the `getTracebackObject` information is not available, the bug should be fixed.
