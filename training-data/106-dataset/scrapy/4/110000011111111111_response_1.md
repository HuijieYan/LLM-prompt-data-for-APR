The error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function, where the `AttributeError` is raised when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`. This error is most likely due to an incorrect attribute access or a mismatched type.

Given the error message and the context, it appears that the `exc_value` is not being handled properly, leading to the AttributeError. The `exc_value` is expected to be an instance of `HttpError` with a `__cause__` attribute, but the code is encountering an issue when trying to access `__traceback__`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `eb_wrapper` correctly handles the exception and its traceback. This can be achieved by modifying the `eb_wrapper` implementation to properly handle the exception and pass the traceback information to the `results.addError()` method.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_clean_req` method:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (type(failure.value), failure.value, failure.getTraceback())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper`, we handle the exception by capturing its type and value, and obtaining the traceback using `failure.getTraceback()`. Then, we pass this information to `results.addError()` to ensure that the exception and its traceback are properly recorded.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the `eb_wrapper` should handle exceptions and their tracebacks correctly.
