The error message suggests that an "AttributeError" is being raised in the traceback module. The error occurs when the "eb_wrapper" function tries to access the "__traceback__" attribute of the exception. This attribute does not exist in the "exc_value.__cause__" object, leading to the AttributeError.

The issue stems from the assignment of the "eb_wrapper" function to the "request.errback" attribute in the "_clean_req" method. The "eb_wrapper" function is not correctly handling the exception information.

To fix the bug, the eb_wrapper function should be modified to handle the exception properly and ensure that the necessary attributes are accessed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the "eb_wrapper" function, the "exc_info" assignment has been updated to access the exception information correctly. Additionally, the naming of the parameters has been adjusted to improve clarity.
