The error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function, where `exc_info` is being formed. The error message suggests an AttributeError caused by an object type mismatch.

The bug is occurring because the `exc_info` in `eb_wrapper` is not being created properly due to the incorrect use of the `failure.getTracebackObject()` method. This is leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `eb_wrapper` function needs to be modified to properly form the `exc_info` tuple. The correct way to do this is to use `failure.printDetailedTraceback()` instead of `failure.getTracebackObject()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors"""

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.printDetailedTraceback()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With this correction, the `exc_info` tuple is formed using `failure.printDetailedTraceback()`, ensuring that the `__traceback__` attribute is accessible without any AttributeError.
