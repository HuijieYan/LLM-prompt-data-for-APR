The bug is occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class. The issue stems from the way the `exc_info` variable is being generated using the `failure` object. The `exc_info` variable needs to be modified to correctly capture the exception information.

The reason for the bug is that the `exc_info` is being constructed incorrectly, resulting in the AttributeError when it is used later in the code.

To fix the bug, the `failure.getTracebackObject()` should be replaced with `failure.getTraceback()`. Additionally, the `failure.type` should be replaced with `type(failure.value)` to correctly capture the exception type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTraceback())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

By making these changes, the `eb_wrapper` function will correctly capture the exception information and avoid the AttributeError issue.
