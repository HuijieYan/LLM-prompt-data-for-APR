The potential error in the given function is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not returning any value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the bug is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not returning any value, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the error handling logic in the `cb_wrapper` function also needs improvement.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions return the expected values. Also, we need to improve the error handling logic in the `cb_wrapper` function to properly handle exceptions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            return output
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
``` 

In the corrected code:
- The `cb_wrapper` function now returns the `output` value and properly handles exceptions.
- The `eb_wrapper` function remains the same as it does not return any value, which is expected.
