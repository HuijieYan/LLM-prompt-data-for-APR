The bug is likely occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function. Based on the error message, it seems that the `AttributeError` is being raised while trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the exception. This could be happening due to a mismanagement of exception types or traceback objects.

The bug is likely occurring because the `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` in the `eb_wrapper` function is not being handled correctly or is missing essential traceback information.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `exc_info` variable contains the correct exception information, including the traceback. We might need to modify how the `exc_info` is being constructed and passed to `results.addError`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

def _create_testcase(method, desc):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```
