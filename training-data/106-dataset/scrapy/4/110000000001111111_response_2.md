The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the `__traceback__` attribute when using the `results.addError` function inside the `eb_wrapper`. This suggests that the issue lies with the `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError`. The `exc_info` should include the exception class, the exception instance, and the traceback of the exception, but it seems that it is not properly constructed or utilized in the original code.

The bug is occurring because the `exc_info` being passed to `results.addError` in the `eb_wrapper` is not correctly formatted or obtained from the failure. This results in the AttributeError when accessing the `__traceback__` attribute.

To resolve this issue, the `exc_info` should be properly initialized with the exception class, the exception instance, and the traceback of the exception. Additionally, the exception handling in the `cb_wrapper` should also be improved by specifying the type of exception that is expected.

The bug can be fixed by updating the `eb_wrapper` to correctly construct the `exc_info` and updating the exception handling in the `cb_wrapper` to specify the type of exception that is being handled.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps
import scrapy

# this is the fixed function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(scrapy.utils.iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
``` 

In the fixed code, the `cb_wrapper` now specifically catches `Exception` and constructs the `exc_info` tuple with the appropriate exception class, instance, and traceback. Additionally, the `eb_wrapper` now constructs the `exc_info` similarly with the correct parameters.
