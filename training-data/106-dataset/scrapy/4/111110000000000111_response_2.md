The issue seems to be related to the `eb_wrapper` function, which is called when there is an error back (non-200 response) from the request. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the `__traceback__` attribute.

Looking at the `eb_wrapper` function, the error occurs when trying to access the `failure.value`, `failure.type`, and `failure.getTracebackObject()`. It seems like these attributes are not being accessed correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle the exception properly when accessing these attributes. Additionally, the `cb_wrapper` function should also be modified to handle any exceptions that occur during callback execution.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:  # handle any exception that occurs during callback execution
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            try:  # handle any exception that occurs when accessing failure attributes
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
                exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
                results.addError(case, exc_info)
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
``` 

In the corrected code, both `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are modified to properly handle any exceptions that may occur during their execution. This should address the AttributeError issue.
