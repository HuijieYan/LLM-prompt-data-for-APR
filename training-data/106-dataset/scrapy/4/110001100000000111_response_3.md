The error seems to be related to the `eb_wrapper` function in the `_clean_req` method in the provided code. The error message indicates that there is an attribute error with the `__traceback__` attribute, suggesting that the traceback is not correctly handled or retrieved.

The error occurs because when adding an error to the results, the code is trying to access the traceback info from `failure`, but it is not being accessed correctly based on the error message. This can lead to an AttributeError when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `exc_info` should be accessed correctly in the `eb_wrapper` function. Then, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_4/scrapy/contracts/__init__.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _create_testcase(method, desc):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def cb_wrapper(response):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def eb_wrapper(failure):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the fixed function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except Exception as e:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, (type(e), e, e.__traceback__))

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, type(failure.value), failure.frames[0]['failure'].getTraceback()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the fixed code, when catching an exception in `cb_wrapper`, it is explicitly catching the `Exception` and capturing the exception type, value, and traceback information. Similarly, in `eb_wrapper`, the traceback is accessed using `failure.frames[0]['failure'].getTraceback()` to ensure it is retrieved correctly.
