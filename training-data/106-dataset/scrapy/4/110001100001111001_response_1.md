The bug in the provided code is that the `eb_wrapper` and `cb_wrapper` functions are defined within the `_clean_req` method, but they are not being used correctly. Instead, two new functions with the same names are being defined in the global scope.

The reason this bug occurs is that the `eb_wrapper` and `cb_wrapper` functions are defined at the local scope of the `_clean_req` function and should not be called directly. They are intended to be used as callback and errback functions for the `request` object.

To fix the bug, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions need to be included as nested functions inside the `_clean_req` method and directly assigned to the `request.callback` and `request.errback` attributes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = request.callback(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With these changes, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are defined within the `_clean_req` method and will be assigned correctly to the `request.callback` and `request.errback` attributes. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the code works as expected.
