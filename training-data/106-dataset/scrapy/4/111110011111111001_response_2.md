The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`. This error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `traceback.TracebackException` class. The root cause of this error is that the `exc_value.__cause__` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

Based on the error message and the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the `eb_wrapper` method where it attempts to access the traceback of the failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc_value` does not contain a `__traceback__` attribute, causing the AttributeError when trying to access it.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `eb_wrapper` method to handle the case where `exc_value.__cause__` does not have a `__traceback__` attribute. Additionally, the `exc_info` should include the formatted exception information.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys
import traceback

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected eb_wrapper function
    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (
            type(failure.value).__name__,
            failure.value,
            traceback.format_exception(failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTracebackObject())
        )
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    # corrected _clean_req function
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the `eb_wrapper` function now captures the exception type, value, and formatted traceback using `traceback.format_exception`, and then adds it to the results. This modification should handle the AttributeError and provide the necessary exception information.
