The error occurs when the `eb_wrapper` function is called. It seems that the `exc_value` object does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, resulting in an AttributeError.

The reason for the bug is that the `eb_wrapper` function is attempting to access the `__traceback__` attribute of the `exc_value` object, but the object itself does not have this attribute. This is likely due to incorrect handling of the `failure` object passed to the `eb_wrapper` function.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `eb_wrapper` function to handle the `failure` object correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, we access the `failure` object's traceback using `failure.getTracebackObject()` instead of directly trying to access `failure.value.__traceback__`. This should resolve the AttributeError and fix the bug.
