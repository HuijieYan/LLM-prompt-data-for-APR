The error message indicates that the AttributeError is caused by the line `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__` in the `_clean_req` function at line 89 of the `scrapy/contracts/__init__.py` file.

The bug occurs because the `__traceback__` attribute is not available for the `__cause__` of the exception.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `eb_wrapper` function in the `_clean_req` method to properly handle the exception being passed. The modified function is provided below.

```python
# Updated eb_wrapper function
def eb_wrapper(failure):
    case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
    exc_info = (failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTraceback())
    results.addError(case, exc_info)
```

In the `eb_wrapper` function, the `failure.value` is used to retrieve the exception value, and the `failure.getTraceback()` method is used to obtain the traceback. This resolves the AttributeError by using the appropriate methods and attributes to retrieve the exception and its traceback.

With this updated `eb_wrapper` function, the `clean_req` method is now fixed.

```python
# Updated _clean_req function
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = (failure.type, failure.value, failure.getTraceback())
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

This fix properly handles errors and exceptions in the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions and ensures that the correct exception information is captured and added to the `results`.
