The error seems to be related to the `eb_wrapper` function within the `_clean_req` method of the `ContractsManager` class. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the object not having a `__traceback__` attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to how errors are being handled in the `eb_wrapper` function. It seems that the `failure` object is being accessed incorrectly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, modify the `eb_wrapper` function to correctly handle the `failure` object and extract the necessary information from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the `exc_info` variable is now assigned the correct values from the `failure` object, which should resolve the AttributeError issue.
