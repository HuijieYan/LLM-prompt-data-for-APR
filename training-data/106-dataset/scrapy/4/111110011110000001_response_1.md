1. The error message is showing that an AttributeError occurred when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__` within the `eb_wrapper` function. This suggests that there is an issue with the exception handling and traceback retrieval within the `eb_wrapper` function.

2. The potential error location is within the `eb_wrapper` function, specifically when trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`.

3. The bug occurred because the exception handling in the `eb_wrapper` function did not handle the retrieval of the traceback object correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, the `__traceback__` attribute needs to be accessed correctly from the `exc_value.__cause__` without causing an AttributeError. Additionally, the `exc_type`, `exc_value`, and `exc_traceback` parameters should be handled appropriately within the function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        cb = request.callback
    
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except Exception as e:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
    
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_type = failure.type
            exc_value = failure.value
            exc_traceback = failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback))
    
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With the corrected code, the exception handling within the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions is updated to handle exceptions and retrieval of exception information correctly. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring and ensure that the error information is properly captured and handled.
