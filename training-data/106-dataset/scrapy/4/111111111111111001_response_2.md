The error seems to occur in the `eb_wrapper` function when it tries to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`. It seems that `exc_value.__cause__` is a `getset_descriptor` object and does not have a `__traceback__` attribute, hence causing the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the `__traceback__` attribute access more gracefully and accommodate the case where `exc_value.__cause__` is a `getset_descriptor` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

# ... (other imports and code)

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... (omitted code)

    # this is the corrected function
    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

        cb = request.callback

        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            if hasattr(failure.value, "__traceback__"):  # Check if __traceback__ attribute exists
                exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            else:
                exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, None  # Set traceback to None if attribute does not exist
            results.addError(case, exc_info)

        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

This fix includes a check for the existence of the `__traceback__` attribute in the `eb_wrapper` function. If the attribute does not exist, it sets the `exc_info` to include `None` for the traceback.

This should resolve the AttributeError and handle the case more gracefully.
