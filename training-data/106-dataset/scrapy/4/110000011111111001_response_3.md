The error occurs in the `eb_wrapper` function when attempting to create a `TracebackException` object. This is likely due to the `exc_value.__cause__.__traceback__` line trying to access the `__traceback__` attribute of `exc_value.__cause__`, but it's failing for some reason.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `__traceback__` attribute exists on `exc_value.__cause__` before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function with the fix:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """Stop the request from returning objects and record any errors"""

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        if hasattr(exc_info[0].__cause__, '__traceback__'):  # Check if __traceback__ attribute exists
            exc_info = exc_info[0], exc_info[1], exc_info[0].__cause__.__traceback__
        else:
            exc_info = exc_info[0], exc_info[1], None
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

By adding the `hasattr` check to verify the existence of the `__traceback__` attribute, we prevent the AttributeError from occurring. This should fix the bug.
