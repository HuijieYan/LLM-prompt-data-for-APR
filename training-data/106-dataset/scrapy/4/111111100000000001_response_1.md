The potential error in the given code lies in the `_clean_req` function. The `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions within the `_clean_req` function are not defined properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not defined within the scope of the `_clean_req` function. As a result, when the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are called, they are not able to access the `cb` and `results` variables defined within the `_clean_req` function.

To fix this bug, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions need to be defined within the `_clean_req` function so that they have access to the `cb` and `results` variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

# ... other imports ...

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... other functions ...

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
        
        cb = request.callback
        
        @wraps(cb)
        def cb_wrapper(response):
            try:
                output = cb(response)
                output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
            except:
                case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
                results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())
        
        def eb_wrapper(failure):
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
            exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
            results.addError(case, exc_info)
        
        request.callback = cb_wrapper
        request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are defined within the `_clean_req` function and have access to the `cb` and `results` variables.
