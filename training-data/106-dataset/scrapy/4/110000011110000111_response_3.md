The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `eb_wrapper` function of the problematic function `_clean_req`. Specifically, the `__traceback__` attribute is being accessed from an object that does not have this attribute, resulting in an AttributeError.

The root cause of the bug is that `exc_value.__cause__` is being accessed assuming it has a `__traceback__` attribute, but it appears that `exc_value.__cause__` is a `getset_descriptor` object, which does not have this attribute.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to verify if `exc_value.__cause__` is not a `getset_descriptor` object and then access its `__traceback__` attribute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from functools import wraps
import sys

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        if not hasattr(failure.value.__cause__, '__traceback__'):
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject())
        else:
            exc_info = (failure.value, failure.type, failure.value.__traceback__)
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

In the corrected function, we added a check to verify if `failure.value.__cause__` has a `__traceback__` attribute. If it does not, then we use the `failure.getTracebackObject()` method to obtain the traceback, otherwise, we directly access `failure.value.__traceback__`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
