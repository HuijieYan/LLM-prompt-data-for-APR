The error message states that there is an AttributeError when the contract's errback is trying to handle a non-200 response. The specific error is 'getset_descriptor' object has no attribute '__traceback__'. This indicates that there is an issue with the way the traceback is being accessed or utilized within the errback function.

Upon inspection of the function _clean_req, it's clear that the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions are defined within _clean_req, leading to scope and access issues. Additionally, the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper are being redefined as non-methods within _clean_req, which might lead to the AttributeError mentioned in the error message.

To fix the bug, the cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper functions should be defined as methods of the ContractsManager class. This allows them to have access to the class attributes and methods seamlessly. Additionally, the use of @wraps(cb) seems unnecessary and can be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import wraps

class ContractsManager(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def cb_wrapper(self, response):
        try:
            output = self.cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(self.method, 'callback')
            self.results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(self, failure):
        case = _create_testcase(self.method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        self.results.addError(case, exc_info)

    def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
        """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """
    
        self.cb = request.callback
        self.method = method
        self.results = results

        request.callback = self.cb_wrapper
        request.errback = self.eb_wrapper
```

By defining cb_wrapper and eb_wrapper as class methods and using self to access the required attributes, we ensure that they have the necessary context and structure to handle the request and error cases appropriately.
