The error occurs when a non-200 response is received and the `addError` method is called. The AttributeError is raised because the `addError` method tries to access the `__traceback__` attribute, which is missing.

The potential error location within the `eb_wrapper` function in the `_clean_req` method is the line `exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()`. Instead of calling `failure.getTracebackObject()`, the correct method to use is `failure.getTraceback()`. This is likely causing the `exc_info` to be incorrectly constructed, leading to the AttributeError in the `addError` method.

To fix this bug, the call to `failure.getTracebackObject()` should be replaced with `failure.getTraceback()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` method:

```python
def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    @wraps(cb)
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTraceback()  # fixed this line
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

With this fix, the AttributeError should no longer occur, and the `exc_info` will be properly constructed when calling `addError` method.
