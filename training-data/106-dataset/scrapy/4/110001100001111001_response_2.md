The issue in the `_clean_req` function is that the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions are not being defined within the scope of the `_clean_req` function, leading to unexpected behavior. 

To fix this issue, we need to define the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions within the `_clean_req` function and replace the existing ones. Additionally, we need to remove the `@wraps(cb)` decorator as it is not required in this context.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clean_req` function:

```python
import sys
from functools import wraps

def _clean_req(self, request, method, results):
    """ stop the request from returning objects and records any errors """

    cb = request.callback

    # Define cb_wrapper within the scope of _clean_req function
    def cb_wrapper(response):
        try:
            output = cb(response)
            output = list(iterate_spider_output(output))
        except:
            case = _create_testcase(method, 'callback')
            results.addError(case, sys.exc_info())

    # Define eb_wrapper within the scope of _clean_req function
    def eb_wrapper(failure):
        case = _create_testcase(method, 'errback')
        exc_info = failure.value, failure.type, failure.getTracebackObject()
        results.addError(case, exc_info)

    request.callback = cb_wrapper
    request.errback = eb_wrapper
```

This corrected code should resolve the issues with `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` by defining them within the scope of the `_clean_req` function. Now, when this function is called, the `cb_wrapper` and `eb_wrapper` functions will be correctly assigned to the `request.callback` and `request.errback` attributes, respectively.
