The potential error in the given function `gunzip` is the use of the `read1` function, which is not defined in the provided code. It seems like `read1` should be a custom function or a reference to the `read` method of the `GzipFile` object. 

The reason for the bug is that the `read1` function is being called but not defined or imported in the provided code, which causes a NameError. This results in an incomplete or incorrect gunzip operation.

To fix the bug, the `read1` function should be replaced with the `read` method of the `GzipFile` object. This method reads and returns the specified number of bytes from the GzipFile object.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Replace read1 with the read method of GzipFile
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

With this correction, the `gunzip` function should now work as intended, reading input data and returning the gunzipped output.
