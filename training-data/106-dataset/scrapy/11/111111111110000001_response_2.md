The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not found in the specified directory.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'gunzip' function, particularly in the line where the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is being opened.

The bug is occurring because the 'gunzip' function is trying to open the 'unexpected-eof.gz' file from a specific directory, but it is unable to find it.

To fix this bug, we can modify the 'gunzip' function to accept the file path as a parameter rather than hardcoding the file path. This would allow us to pass the absolute file path from the test function.

Here is the corrected 'gunzip' function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(file_path):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
        output = b''
        chunk = b'.'
        while chunk:
            try:
                chunk = f.read(8196)
                output += chunk
            except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
                if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                    try:
                        output += f.extrabuf
                    finally:
                        break
                else:
                    raise
        return output
```

By modifying the 'gunzip' function to accept the file path as a parameter and using it to open the file within the function, we can now pass the absolute file path from the test function, which should resolve the file-not-found issue.
