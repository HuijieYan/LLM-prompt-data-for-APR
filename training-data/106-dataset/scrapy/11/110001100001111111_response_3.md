The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is the loop that reads chunks of data from the `GzipFile` object and appends them to the `output` variable. The error is likely occurring when the chunk of data is read and appended to `output`.

The reason for the bug could be related to the handling of the data read from the Gzip file and the size of the chunk being read. It's possible that the loop is not correctly handling the data read, leading to duplicate or erroneous content in the `output` variable.

To fix the bug, we can modify the loop to properly handle the data read from the Gzip file and ensure that there is no duplication of content.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')  # specify mode as 'rb' to ensure correct data reading
    output = b''

    try:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # read a chunk of data
            if not chunk:  # if no more data is read, break out of the loop
                break
            output += chunk  # append the chunk to the output
    except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):  # handle potential errors
        output += f.extrabuf  # append any remaining data
    finally:
        f.close()  # close the GzipFile object
    
    return output
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `read` method of the GzipFile object to read chunks of data, and ensuring that all the data read is properly appended to the `output` variable. We also handle potential errors by catching the appropriate exceptions and appending any remaining data if an error occurs. Lastly, we ensure that the GzipFile object is closed properly.
