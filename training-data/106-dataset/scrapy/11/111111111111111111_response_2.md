The error message indicates that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' is not found, which is being opened in the test function 'test_gunzip_illegal_eof'. This suggests that the file path 'SAMPLEDIR' is incorrect or the file is missing.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the 'gunzip' function, specifically when the gzip file is being opened. The error occurs due to the incorrect file path or missing file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a wrong file path or missing file, which causes the 'open' function in the test case to raise a FileNotFoundError.

To fix this bug, the file path 'SAMPLEDIR' should be checked to ensure it points to the correct location of the 'unexpected-eof.gz' file. Additionally, the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' should be present at the specified location.

Here's the corrected function for the 'gunzip' function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile
from os.path import join

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read1(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

Please note that the file path 'SAMPLEDIR' needs to be correctly defined in the test case for it to work as expected.
