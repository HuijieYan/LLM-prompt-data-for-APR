The potential error in the function is that it's missing the import statement for the required GzipFile and BytesIO classes. A missing import statement could cause the program to fail when trying to run the function.

To fix this issue, the missing import statements for GzipFile and BytesIO need to be added at the beginning of the script.

Here's the corrected function with the necessary import statements:

```python
from io import BytesIO
import gzip

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

With these changes, the function should now work correctly.
