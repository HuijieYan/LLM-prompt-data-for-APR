The potential error in the buggy function is located in the while loop where the data is being read in chunks and concatenated to the output. The issue seems to be related to handling the end of the compressed data, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

The bug occurs because the while loop does not properly handle the end of the compressed data. As a result, it can lead to an infinite loop if the end of the data is not correctly detected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `f.read()` method to read the entire uncompressed data from the GzipFile object, instead of reading it in chunks. Additionally, we can handle the end of the compressed data by catching the `EOFError` and breaking out of the loop when it occurs.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')
    try:
        output = f.read()
    except EOFError:
        output = f.extrabuf
    finally:
        f.close()
    return output
```
