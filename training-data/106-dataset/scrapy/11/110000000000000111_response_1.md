The bug is related to the `gunzip` function, which is responsible for unzipping the given data. The bug is causing the response content to be duplicated in scrapy's `response.body`.

The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is the handling of the gzip data and extraction of the content.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the gzip data correctly, leading to the duplication of the response content.

To fix the bug, the `gunzip` function needs to be modified to handle the gzip data and extraction of the content correctly.

Here's the corrected `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
    return output
```
