Potential bug location:
The potential bug location is the try-except block where it catches IOError, EOFError, and struct.error exceptions. Within this block, there is an issue with the logic that may cause the function to raise an exception instead of properly handling it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the `f.extrabuf` contains the whole page content in the except block. This causes incorrect handling of the gzip data, leading to potential errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `f.extrabuf` contains the whole page content and handle it separately from the IOErrors, EOFErrors, and struct.errors.
2. Use a more robust try-except block that properly handles exceptions and only raises the exception if necessary.

Corrected code:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # Complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # See issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # Some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```
The corrected code handles the f.extrabuf case separately from the IOError, EOFError, and struct.error exceptions, ensuring proper handling of the gzip data and avoiding potential errors.
