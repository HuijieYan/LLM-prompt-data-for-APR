The bug in the gunzip function is not directly related to the GitHub issue of "response.body is duplicate." The issue is with the gunzip function itself, and it is not related to the scrapy framework.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of exceptions in the while loop. The except block is catching IOError, EOFError, and struct.error, but the logic inside the block seems to be incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the gunzip function is not properly handling errors and extracting the uncompressed data.

To fix the bug, you can use the following corrected code for the gunzip function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        output = f.read()
    
    return output
```

In the corrected code:
1. We are using the gzip module's GzipFile directly to read the compressed data.
2. The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
3. We read the entire content using f.read() and return the output.

This corrected code should properly handle gzip decompression without the need to manually handle exceptions within the while loop, as was the case in the original buggy function.
