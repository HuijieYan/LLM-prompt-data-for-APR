Potential error location: The issue might be with the `gunzip` function, specifically the while loop and exception handling.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The current implementation of the `gunzip` function does not handle the gzip data correctly, leading to duplicate content in the output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `lzma` module to handle the gzip data.
2. Check for any encoding or decoding issues related to the gzip data.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import lzma
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    fileobj = BytesIO(data)
    try:
        decompressed_data = lzma.decompress(data)
        return decompressed_data
    except lzma.LZMAError as e:
        print(f"Error while decompressing data: {e}")
        return b''  # Return empty bytes in case of error
```
This corrected code uses the `lzma` module to handle the gzip data and returns the decompressed data. Additionally, it handles any `lzma.LZMAError` by returning an empty bytes object in case of an error.
