The error message indicates that the file '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_11/tests/sample_data/compressed/unexpected-eof.gz' is not found. This suggests that the file path is incorrect, which could be the cause of the issue.

The file path is being constructed using the variable `SAMPLEDIR`, which is not provided in the code snippet. It seems like `SAMPLEDIR` should be a variable defined somewhere else in the code.

To fix the issue:
1. Ensure that `SAMPLEDIR` is correctly defined and contains the correct path to the file 'unexpected-eof.gz'.
2. Ensure that the file 'unexpected-eof.gz' exists in the specified location.

If the file exists in the correct location, and `SAMPLEDIR` is correctly defined, the issue should be resolved.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        output = b''
        chunk = b'.'
        while chunk:
            try:
                chunk = f.read(8196)
                output += chunk
            except (EOFError, OSError, RuntimeError):
                # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
                # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
                # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
                # contains the whole page content
                if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                    try:
                        output += f.extrabuf
                    finally:
                        break
                else:
                    raise
        return output
```
