The potential error in the given function `gunzip` is the use of the `read1` function without specifying the correct module that it belongs to. This is likely causing a NameError when trying to call `read1`.

To fix this bug, you should import the correct function from the `scrapy.utils.gz` module and use it instead of calling `read1`.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import struct
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'

    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)  # Using read instead of read1
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
            # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
            # contains the whole page content
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

In the corrected code, I replaced `read1` with `f.read` to correctly use the `read` method from the `GzipFile` object. This should resolve the NameError and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
