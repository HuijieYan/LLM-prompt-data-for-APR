Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `gunzip` function due to the use of the `GzipFile` class and the `read1` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be caused by improper handling of exceptions and the logic for when to complete the extraction of the Gzip data. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add proper exception handling for the `GzipFile` and `read1` methods.
2. Adjust the logic for when to complete the extraction of the Gzip data to ensure all valid data is returned.

Corrected code:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```
