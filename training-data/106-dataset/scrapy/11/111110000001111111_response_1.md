The issue with the provided function gunzip(data) is that it is not correctly handling the decompression of gzip data. It seems to be reading the data in chunks and concatenating it without proper decompression. This could lead to duplicate or incorrect data being returned.

The potential error location is the while loop that reads the data in chunks and concatenates it, as well as the exception handling that tries to handle CRC checksum errors.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly using the GzipFile class to decompress the data. Instead, it is attempting to read the data in chunks and concatenate it, which can lead to duplicate or incorrect data being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly use the GzipFile class to decompress the data. This will ensure that the decompressed data is returned without any issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode="rb") as f:
        try:
            output = f.read()
        except (EOFError, IOError, OSError):
            output = b''
    return output
```

The corrected function uses the gzip module to properly decompress the data and return the decompressed output. It also handles exceptions in a more appropriate manner.
