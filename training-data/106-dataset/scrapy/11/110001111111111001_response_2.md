The `test_gunzip_illegal_eof` test case is trying to open a file 'unexpected-eof.gz' that does not exist, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. This error is not directly related to the bug in the `gunzip` function.

Looking at the `gunzip` function, the potential error location is within the while loop where the `read1` function is called. The issue might arise from improper handling of the EOF condition.

The bug occurs because the while loop in the `gunzip` function does not handle the EOF condition properly, causing an unexpected behavior when trying to read the gzip data.

To fix the bug, an approach would be to explicitly check for the EOF condition and handle it appropriately within the while loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import struct
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO

def read1(gzf, size=-1):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = read1(f, 8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for the EOF condition is included within the while loop to handle it appropriately. Now, the function should be able to handle EOF errors without raising exceptions.
