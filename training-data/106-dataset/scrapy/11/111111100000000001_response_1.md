The potential error location within the "gunzip" function is the loop that reads data from the GzipFile and appends it to the "output" variable. The try-except block is catching errors such as IOError, EOFError, and struct.error, but it's not handling them properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not effectively handling potential errors that can occur when reading from the GzipFile.

To fix the bug, we can modify the try-except block to properly handle the errors and ensure that the function returns the uncompressed data even if there are errors in the input Gzip data.

Here's the corrected code for the "gunzip" function:

```python
from gzip import GzipFile
from io import BytesIO
import struct

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk
        except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # Catch and ignore errors while reading
            pass
    return output
```

In the corrected code, we use a simpler while loop to read chunks of data from the GzipFile and append them to the "output" variable. We catch and ignore any errors that occur during the reading process, ensuring that the function is resilient to CRC checksum errors. Finally, we return the uncompressed data as the output of the function.
