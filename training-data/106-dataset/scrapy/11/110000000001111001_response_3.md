The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the extrabuf attribute in the except block. The extrabuf attribute may not exist in all cases, which can lead to AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the extrabuf attribute does not exist properly, which may result in an AttributeError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the extrabuf attribute exists before trying to access it. Additionally, we can simplify the code by using a more standard approach to reading and decompressing Gzip data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()

    return output
```
