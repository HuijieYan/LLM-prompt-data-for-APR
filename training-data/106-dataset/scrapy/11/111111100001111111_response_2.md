The bug seems to be occurring in the `gunzip` function. The function is expected to gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible, while being resilient to CRC checksum errors.

The issue description provided suggests that the response.body is being duplicated when using the `scrapy shell` to fetch the content of a URL. This indicates that the `gunzip` function is not correctly handling the data it receives, possibly causing the duplication of the response body.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the `gunzip` function is not correctly reading and processing the gzip data, which leads to the duplication issue.

To fix this bug, the `gunzip` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the gzip data. Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        output = f.read()
    return output
```

In the corrected function, we use the `gzip.GzipFile` to read the uncompressed data and return it, ensuring that the gzip data is correctly handled and there are no duplication issues.
