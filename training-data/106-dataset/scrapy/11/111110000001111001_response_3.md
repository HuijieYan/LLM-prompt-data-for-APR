Potential error location: The potential error location is in the while loop where the data is being read and added to the output. There are multiple exceptions being caught, and the handling of the 'struct.error' exception seems to be problematic.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the handling of the 'struct.error' exception is not appropriately implemented. The code attempts to catch the exception but does not handle it effectively. As a result, it may lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with 'struct.error' exceptions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Restructure the exception handling to ensure that 'struct.error' exceptions are handled correctly.
2. Refactor the code to use a more pythonic and efficient way of reading and adding data to the output.

Corrected code:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb')
    output = b''
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(8196)
        if not chunk:
            break
        output += chunk
    f.close()
    return output
```
