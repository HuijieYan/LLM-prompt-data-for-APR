The bug is likely occurring in the `gunzip` function. It seems to be reading more data than necessary, resulting in duplicate content in the output. It is likely that the loop in the function is not terminating at the correct point.

The potential reason for the duplicate content in the response is that the function `gunzip` is reading more data than needed from the GzipFile object, resulting in duplicate content.

To fix the bug, the `gunzip` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the termination of the loop and the concatenation of the chunks of data.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    output = b''

    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if not chunk:
                break
            output += chunk

    return output
```

In the corrected code, the `gunzip` function opens the GzipFile using the `gzip.GzipFile` class and reads the data in chunks, concatenating each chunk to the output. This ensures that only the necessary data is read and returned, avoiding the issue of duplicate content.
