Potential Error Location: The error could be occurring in the `gunzip` function, specifically in the while loop where it tries to read from the `GzipFile` object `f` using the `read1` function.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug might be caused by the improper handling of exceptions in the while loop. The `struct.error` exception is not being caught properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a more specific exception handling for the `struct.error` exception.
2. Add proper error messages or logging to identify the specific cause of the exception.
3. Ensure that the loop stops when an exception is encountered, and any existing data is handled and returned.

Corrected Code:
```python
import struct
from io import BytesIO
from gzip import GzipFile

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    try:
        while chunk:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            output += chunk
    except (IOError, EOFError, struct.error):
        # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
        # see issue 87 about catching struct.error
        # some pages are quite small so output is '' and f.extrabuf
        # contains the whole page content
        if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
            try:
                output += f.extrabuf
            finally:
                return output
        else:
            raise
    return output
```
