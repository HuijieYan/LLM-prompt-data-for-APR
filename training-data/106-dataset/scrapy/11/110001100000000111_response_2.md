1. The test case provided in the issue description seems to be related to the `gunzip` function, which is responsible for unzipping data and returning it. The issue mentioned that `response.body` is duplicate, indicating that the `gunzip` function might be returning duplicate data.

2. The potential error location within the `gunzip` function is the loop that reads chunks of data from the GzipFile and appends them to the `output` variable.

3. The bug might be occurring due to the duplicated appending of data to the `output` variable within the while loop. It seems that the loop is appending the `chunk` to `output` twice.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `chunk` exists before appending it to the `output` variable. Additionally, it's important to handle any exceptions appropriately and ensure that the correct data is returned.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''
    chunk = b'.'
    while chunk:
        try:
            chunk = f.read(8196)
            if chunk:
                output += chunk
        except (OSError, EOFError, struct.error):
            # complete only if there is some data, otherwise re-raise
            if output or getattr(f, 'extrabuf', None):
                try:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                finally:
                    break
            else:
                raise
    return output
```

In this corrected code, the `chunk` is only appended to the `output` variable if it exists, avoiding any duplicate data appending. Additionally, the exceptions are handled appropriately within the while loop.
