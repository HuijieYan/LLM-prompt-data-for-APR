The bug in the provided function `gunzip` is that it is trying to call the `read1` function, which is not defined. Instead, the `read` function from the `gzip` module should be used to read data from the `GzipFile` object.

The reason for the bug is that the `read1` function is not a standard Python function or a custom function defined in the given code, and thus, it cannot be used in the `gunzip` function. Additionally, the `f.extrabuf` attribute is not a standard attribute of the `GzipFile` object.

To fix this bug, the `read1` function should be replaced with the `read` function from the `gzip` module, and the code should be modified to handle data reading from the `GzipFile` object more reliably.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        output = b''
        chunk = b'.'
        while chunk:
            try:
                chunk = f.read(8196)
                output += chunk
            except (OSError, EOFError):
                if output or f.extrabuf:
                    output += f.extrabuf
                    break
                else:
                    raise
        return output
```
