Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the function "gunzip" which is used to gunzip the data and return as much as possible. The bug might be causing the response.body to be duplicated.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug in the "gunzip" function could be causing the response data to be duplicated, possibly due to errors in reading the gzip data or handling the extrabuf.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for any errors occurring during the gzip reading or handling process.
2. Ensure that the extrabuf is handled correctly and not causing duplication of data.

Corrected code for the "gunzip" function:
```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    f = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data))
    output = b''

    try:
        output = f.read()
    except IOError:
        # Handle any IOError
        pass

    return output
```
