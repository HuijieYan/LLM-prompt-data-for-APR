Potential error location: The issue is likely in the `read1` function, which is not properly defined and called within the `gunzip` function.

Reasons behind the bug: The `read1` function is not properly implemented, and it looks like it is trying to read data from a GzipFile but is not properly defined within the code provided.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Define the `read1` function properly within the code.
2. Use existing libraries or functions to read data from the GzipFile instead of implementing a custom `read1` function.

Corrected code:

```python
from io import BytesIO
import gzip

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data)) as f:
        return f.read()
```
