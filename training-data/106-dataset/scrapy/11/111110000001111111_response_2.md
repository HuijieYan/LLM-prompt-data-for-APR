The error message "response.body is duplicate" in the GitHub issue doesn't seem to be directly related to the buggy function provided, as it mentions scrapy's response.body being duplicate. However, it's possible that the issue with response duplication could be caused by the buggy function.

In the buggy function, the `gunzip` function is supposed to decompress the given gzip data and return the decompressed data. However, looking at the runtime values, the `f` variable holds a GzipFile object, and the `output` variable is supposed to store the decompressed data. The `chunk` variable also seems to represent a chunk of the decompressed data.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of the decompressed data and the possibility of it being duplicated. One possible reason for this could be the incorrect handling of the output and the chunks read from the GzipFile. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the `gunzip` function to correctly decompress the gzip data and return the decompressed output without any duplication.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import gzip
import io

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=io.BytesIO(data)) as f:
        output = f.read()
        return output
```

In this corrected function:
1. We use the `gzip.GzipFile` to directly read the decompressed data from the input gzip data.
2. We then return the decompressed output without any additional handling or concatenation of chunks.

This should address the issue of duplicated response by correctly decompressing the input gzip data and returning the decompressed output.
