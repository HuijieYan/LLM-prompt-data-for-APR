The bug in the provided function is likely causing the response content to be duplicated. The bug seems to be related to the handling of data when unzipping (gunzipping) in the `gunzip` function.

The potential error location within the function is the while loop where the data is being read and concatenated into the `output` variable. There seems to be an issue with handling the extraction of the data from the GzipFile.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug could be related to the erroneous handling of data extraction from the GzipFile, which results in duplicate content being returned.

To fix the bug, the GzipFile should be read and decompressed in a proper way to avoid duplicate content. Additionally, error handling should be improved to ensure that the function behaves as expected and doesn't return duplicate data.

Here's the corrected code for the `gunzip` function:

```python
import gzip
from io import BytesIO

def gunzip(data):
    """Gunzip the given data and return as much data as possible.

    This is resilient to CRC checksum errors.
    """
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(data), mode='rb') as f:
        return f.read()
```

In the corrected code, the `gzip` module is used to handle the decompression of the data. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes. This should fix the issue with duplicate content and ensure correct decompression of the data.
