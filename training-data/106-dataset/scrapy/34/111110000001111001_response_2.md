Based on the provided input and expected output, the bug in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class is that it is not properly processing the input bases and attrs dictionaries to create new bases, and attributes for the class.

The new_bases value is not determined correctly based on the input bases. Additionally, the processing of attributes and fields is not done properly. The algorithm for creating new_bases and attributes should be improved.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Iterate through the input bases and check if each base has a '_class' attribute. If so, create new_bases based on those.
2. Process the input attributes and check for instances of Field objects. Add them to the `fields` dictionary and construct the new_attrs with '_class' and 'fields' attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = ()
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            new_bases += (base._class,)
    fields = {k: v for k, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    new_attrs = {k: v for k, v in attrs.items() if k in fields or k == '_class'}
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
This corrected code iterates through the input bases and attributes to create new_bases and new_attrs as intended, then correctly calls the superclass `__new__` method with the updated arguments.
