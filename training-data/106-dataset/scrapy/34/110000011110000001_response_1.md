The `__new__` method is trying to create a new class using the provided parameters, but it's not handling multiple inheritance correctly, which is causing the test case to fail.

The potential error location within the function is when it tries to filter the bases and create the new class. The filtering logic for the bases is incomplete and leads to incorrect creation of the new class.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling multiple inheritance properly, specifically the handling of attributes from multiple base classes when creating a new class.

To fix the bug, the code could be modified to correctly handle multiple inheritance. This could involve refining the logic for filtering bases and creating the new class, so that it properly inherits attributes from all base classes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        for n in dir(base):
            v = getattr(base, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
        for n, v in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected function, the multiple inheritance issue should be resolved and the test case should pass.
