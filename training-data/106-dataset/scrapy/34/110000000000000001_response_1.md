Potential Error Location: The code is currently trying to create a new class by calling `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)`, then modifying some attributes and finally calling `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. It seems like the intention is to modify the attributes of the new class and then return the modified class.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
1. The first call to `super().__new__` is creating a new class, but the modified class from that operation is not being used in the subsequent operations.
2. The second call to `super().__new__` is trying to create a new class using the original `bases` and `new_attrs`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of creating a new class twice, we can modify the attributes of the class created in the first call to `super().__new__`.
2. We should also return the modified class created in the first call to `super().__new__`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            attrs[n] = v

    attrs['fields'] = {n: v for n, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    attrs['_class'] = _class
    
    return _class
```
