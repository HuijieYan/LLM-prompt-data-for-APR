The error occurs in the `test_metaclass_multiple_inheritance_diamond` test case. When comparing `D.fields` with a specific dictionary, the assertion fails because the `D.fields` dictionary does not contain the expected values.

The potential error location is within the `__new__` function of the `ItemMeta` class. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the inheritance and aggregation of fields from the parent classes.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__new__` function does not properly traverse the inheritance hierarchy to collect and aggregate the fields from the base classes.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `__new__` function to properly traverse the inheritance hierarchy and collect and aggregate the fields from all base classes. Additionally, we need to ensure that we are handling multiple inheritance correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
# Corrected __new__ function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    for base in new_bases:
        fields.update(base.fields)
    
    for n in attrs:
        if n not in fields:
            v = attrs[n]
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
