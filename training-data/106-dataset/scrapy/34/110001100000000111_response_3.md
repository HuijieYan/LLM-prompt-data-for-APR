The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect merging of the `fields` dictionary. The code is currently overriding the `fields` dictionary instead of merging it, which causes the key error when accessing the fields.

The bug occurs because the code does not merge the `fields` dictionary from the base classes with the `fields` dictionary from the current class. Instead, it overrides the `fields` dictionary with the one from the current class, resulting in missing fields when accessing the merged `fields`.

To fix the bug, the function should merge the `fields` dictionaries from the base classes with the `fields` dictionary from the current class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    
    # Merging fields dictionaries from base classes
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
    
    # Merging fields dictionary from the current class
    for n, v  in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected code, the `fields` dictionary will be properly merged from the base classes and the current class, preventing the key error that was occurring before.
