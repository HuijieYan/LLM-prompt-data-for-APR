The error seems to be occurring in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The issue seems to be that the fields are being overridden instead of merged when inheriting from multiple classes.

The bug occurs because in the `__new__` method, the `new_attrs` dictionary is being overwritten with each iteration of the loop over the class attributes. This causes the fields to be overridden instead of merged.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__new__` method to merge the fields instead of overwriting them when inheriting from multiple classes. We can achieve this by updating the `new_attrs['fields']` dictionary with the fields from each class, rather than overwriting it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
# corrected __new__ method
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            for n in dir(base._class):
                v = getattr(base._class, n)
                if isinstance(v, Field):
                    fields[n] = v

    for n in attrs:
        if isinstance(attrs[n], Field):
            fields[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected method now iterates over the bases and merges the fields into the `fields` dictionary. It then combines these merged fields with the fields present in the `attrs` dictionary to create the final `fields` dictionary. This should resolve the issue of fields being overridden instead of merged when inheriting from multiple classes.
