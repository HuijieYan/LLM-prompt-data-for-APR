The issue in the provided function is in the logic for preparing the `new_attrs` dictionary. When iterating through the `dir(_class)`, only the `Field` objects are added to the `fields` dictionary and all other attributes are added to the `new_attrs` dictionary. This results in missing `update` in the `fields` for `class D` and `class E`.

To fix this, we need to update the logic for preparing the `fields` and `new_attrs` dictionaries inside the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {key: value for key, value in _class.__dict__.items() if isinstance(value, Field)}
    new_attrs = {key: value for key, value in attrs.items() if not isinstance(value, Field)}
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
