Potential error location: The problem likely occurs within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass. The error message indicates that the fields dictionary is not being properly merged or inherited from the parent classes.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is not properly merging the fields from the parent classes. Instead, it is creating a new dictionary and not combining the fields from the parent classes with the current class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, the `__new__` method should be modified to properly merge the fields dictionary from the parent classes and the current class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)
        if hasattr(base, 'attrs'):
            new_attrs.update(base.attrs)

    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
