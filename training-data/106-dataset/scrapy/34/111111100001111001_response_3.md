Potential bug location: The issue lies in the recursive `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation of the `__new__` method creates a new class with modified attributes and then calls `__new__` again with the modified attributes. This recursive behavior results in unexpected changes to the attributes and bases.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of calling `super().__new__` recursively, we can directly create an instance of the class using the `type` function. This will avoid the recursive behavior and ensure that the correct attributes and bases are used.
2. We should also handle the logic for identifying fields and updating the attributes separately from the `__new__` method to avoid confusion with modified attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    class_attrs = {}
    fields = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            class_attrs[n] = v
    class_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_class = type('x_' + name, new_bases, class_attrs)
    return new_class
```
In this corrected code, we directly use the `type` function to create a new class and handle the logic for identifying fields and updating the attributes separately. The recursion is removed to avoid unexpected changes to the attributes and bases.
