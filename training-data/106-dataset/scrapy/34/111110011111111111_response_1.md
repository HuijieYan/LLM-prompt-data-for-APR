The buggy function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class is causing the issue. It is not correctly merging the fields when multiple inheritance is involved. Instead, it is overriding the fields, leading to a key error in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is overwriting the `fields` attribute with a new dictionary, instead of merging the fields from the parent classes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__new__` method as follows:
1. Instead of creating a new dictionary for `new_attrs`, we should update the existing `attrs` dictionary with the merged fields from parent classes.
2. We should loop through the `bases` and merge their `fields` with the `fields` dictionary in the `attrs` parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()  # Copy the attrs to new_attrs
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(base.fields)  # Merge the fields from the parent classes

    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this correction, the `fields` attribute will properly merge fields from parent classes when multiple inheritance is involved. This should resolve the key error in the test case.
